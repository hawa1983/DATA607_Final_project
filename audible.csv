Blood Pact,"Adventure,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Dan Abnett and Toby Longworth are the best possible combination. Another fantastic book. Honestly, I've been looking forward to this day for quite some time, because now I'm going back and listening to them all, in a row. Now that I mention it I'll just do the entirety of the Sabbat Crusade books, see yall in what like, couple hundred hours?,Do you want to live forever?,different from the usual style, no massive battles this time but still well worth a listen"
Fall for You,"Romance,Contemporary",LGBTQ+,"I love the author and J.F. Harding is a definite fav narrator.  Story starts off with us meeting Carson along with his grumpiness and he's got reasons too.  Then there's Davis who we meet next in a restaurant and we see him get fired and blamed Carson but truthfully he wasn't very good at this job.  Carson's mom is next and I liked how she got these two together.  I also liked the flow of the story and of course there were some characters you have to warm up to but that's the fun sometimes. For me this was a low angst sexy story I finished very quickly that I really enjoyed a lot.  I was rolling my eyes at Davis mom sometimes but I got over it. Both Carson and Davis made some not so good decisions in their love life but we get to hear them work thru their issues and bring us that HEA we all love and need.  I've already added this one to my favorites.,Another win for Felice! Such a beautiful story! I love it so much!! JF did a fantastic job narrating!"
Caught Sleeping,Romance,LGBTQ+,"I love this story! It is captivating and exciting!! I used to play soccer and absolutely love the sport side of this book!! Abby Craden is the BEST!!,The combination of Jen Lyon's writing & Abby Craden's narration was top notch again. These two are destined for a very bright future working together. I thought The Senator's Wife was superb, but Caught Sleeping has surpassed that."

Prophet Song,"Genre Fiction,Literary Fiction,Political,Dystopian",Literature & Fiction,"Welcome to Dystopia. Without context one dystopia is as good as another. Some, ANY, context would lend believability to the story. And Ireland!! For gods sake, anywhere but Ireland. Just doesn't ring true. Critics laud the absence of a back story claiming that this nasty autocratic, villainous government could apply to any nasty villainous government anywhere. That's the problem!,The writing is also marred by ""overmetaphorization"". If one metaphor is good then two or three is better. Every item is encrusted with frilly prose which is distracting and slows the pace of the narrative"

All the characters were completely likeable, despite their flaws, and how they brought out the best in one another was lovely. I enjoyed the spice rather a lot and all of the narrators were fabulous - Will Watt and his Yorkshire accent was my favourite. Can‚Äôt wait for Lily‚Äôs next book next month - I‚Äôve already preordered it. If you like spice with a storyline, then you‚Äôll like this.,Loved this beautiful story. It has such steamy moments but then also some heart in the mouth, tears in the eyes heartbreaking moments too.,The narration by Faye Adele, Shane East, Will Watt & John York is fabulous. Especially the multicast podcast sections."
Bikini Days,Contemporary,Romance,"I love the characters ,I loved the nonfiction setting and I loved the fact that it wasn't a lit RPG this just goes to show that good slice of life's don't always need to have fantasy settings for men.,A fun read with some great buildup till the man attraction.

In Your Wildest Dreams,"Contemporary,Sports",Romance,"Audiobook Review,Narrators were 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è and I hate that i didn‚Äôt love this book because I love Rebecca‚Äôs books. It just feel flat for me. I was disappointed that it took her so long to be interested in him. And really that‚Äôs all on me. Writing a book is already amazing so I hate to say this wasn‚Äôt my favorite because of all the time and energy it takes to Even write a book.,Ash was amazing. I loved him so sweet and caring and careful with her, her ex gabe was a tool and I wish more would have happened with him, like legally. It was cute and fun just wasn‚Äôt my favorite at the moment.,I love this series, and watching Ash Kelly throughout didn't give me his true side until now. What a dreamboat and just an all-around great guy. I love all of the Wildcats, but now Ash is my favorite.,,When Ash first lays eyes on Bridgett, it is obvious the guy she is with is a jerk and that she isn't happy but such is life and it was just a chance meeting. Now fast forward, fate has brought them back together, and Ash is determined to get Bridgett to go out with him.,,Bridgett is attracted to the tall handsome hockey player but she knows if she gives in to those attractions it will mean trouble for him from her ex. Gabe is a terrible guy and he now can cause problems for Ash on the team. Bridgett isn't willing to let that happen.,,These two are great for each other and the team and girls who love them are there for both of them. There were some moments for Bridgett that were tough to deal with and I was so glad to see her get to the other side. Ash has a heart of gold and there is so much to this man. I just loved their story and all the supporting characters that were there for them.,,Erin Mallon, and Jason Clarke are amazing narrating this wonderful book. They brought their A game and scored. They were both great from beginning to end. Loved listening to them both.,,This book is 5 stars for me. I loved it and highly recommend it.,I love Rebecca Jenshank‚Äôs hockey series and this installment does not miss on giving you everything you are looking for!,The story I have been waiting for and it was perfect!!! From the adorable meet cute at the hockey game to all the flirting and little pick up lines, Ash & Bridget‚Äôs story was so just enjoyable! The night they met didn‚Äôt go as planned as Bridget had a boyfriend but fate that brought them back together again. However, their dynamic was a slow burn, despite what Ash wanted as Bridget was still dealing with things from her ex. It made their development feel so natural and realistic which I appreciated as it just built up their need for each other even more. Ash was also SO perfect for her as even though he was persistent, he was patient at the same time and never pushed her when asking her out. And yay for no 3rd act break ups! It just made their story even better as we watched them grow from flirting to kissing to more!!,Sports Romance,Hockey Player/Nurse,Boy Obsessed,He Falls First,Found Family,The dynamic duo, Jason Clarke and Erin Mallon gave an outstanding performance for this audiobook! I love when these two do audios together and as always they did not disappoint! They both captured the personalities of Ash and Bridget with their tones and emotions which made it so easy to get lost in the story! After it ended I just wanted more of them as they truly make you fall in love with the characters using their voices! I absolutely loved this one on audio!!,4.5 stars! In Your Wildest Dreams is book 4 in the Wildcat Hockey series and I was so excited about this one after binging the first 3 earlier this year. This is a hockey romance, where he falls first, she‚Äôs his nurse, has found family vibes, and ‚Äúwho did this‚Äù energy. And omg I loved it so much!,I loved Ash Kelly and how much he‚Äôs totally into Bridget from the start. This starts off at a hockey game, he‚Äôs warming up but spots her in the stands and is instantly into her, he even tosses her a puck asking for her number even though she‚Äôs clearly on a date there with someone else. üòÇ I just adored how cocky and flirty he is, she asks if he should be skating around or something instead of trying to talk to her, he says he can‚Äôt since he just me his future wife and needs to know if she‚Äôs single!,About a month later they meet again, when he‚Äôs in the hospital after a concussion and she‚Äôs his nurse! He can‚Äôt believe his luck to see her again and isn‚Äôt going to let her slip away so easily this time when he finds out she‚Äôs now single. I just adored these two together! I loved how determined he is to win her over and just to help her out in general. He finds her an apartment when she needs one, with some of his friends. Which the friend group in here/in this series is just so good! Things also get complicated when her toxic/abusive ex becomes an assistant to the team‚Äôs GM and finds out they‚Äôre seeing one another!,CW: abusive ex (verbal, physical, mental),My favorite two narrators. Loved the performance and the story was super sweet. 5/5,This is the fourth book in the Wildcat Hockey Series, a Sports Romance.  Ash and Bridget's story is beautifully written, sweet, and heartwarming, filled with passion, and drama.  Ash, a pro hockey player, is handsome, charming, kind, and supportive.  Bridget is beautiful,  smart, and determined.  They are perfect together.  I liked the friendship in the story.   This is a beautiful story.  Erin Mallon and Jason Clarke did an excellent job bringing these characters, and this story to life.  I like this series, and I highly recommend it."

I do like the series and hope the next one will be a bit more engaging.,It was a nice distraction in the Tori Hunter series. Interesting to follow the characters, how they evolveÔøº,There was no depth to the story, no mystery, no suspense, and I definitely was not thrilled. Although, I usually enjoy these books, but this one was severely lacking and disappointing. Can't say I'm done with the series, however, I hope the next one is better.,Tori and Braddock have settled into life as a couple, along w his son, Quinn.  This story starts off with the brutal murder of a teenage couple, one is the daughter of the man who once saved Tori‚Äôs life.

A Wreath of Red Roses,"Amateur Sleuths,Animals,Historical","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Each book is clever and fun.   Love the characters.   I guessed the murderer, but who cares, the journey to get him to confess was very entertaining.,Very enjoyable, another great read, but I thought it was clear much sooner than usual who the culprit was.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.,Such a fun story--it moved along well,  with many false clues and turns. Wonderful narration, again, and terrific characters. I couldn't turn it off, and finished the book in one day!! Everytime Mr. Fogg barked, my three dogs chimed it.  Can't wait for the next in the series.,Always enjoy how the puzzles come to a conclusion. I also love all the recurring characters including Tubs and Mr. Fog.,This was a great story!

I devour her work each and every time like nothing else since Christie. I adore Sam's interpretations of these characters. No one could live up to his standard at this point. I hope he narrates all the Lennox books for years to come.,This series ia my favorite because I'm always surprised by ""who done it"".,Sam Dewhurst-Phillips preformance is always spot on,& makes the story come alive.,I highly reccoomend this book & the series,,I can‚Äôt believe I guessed correctly who the killer was!  It was a gut feeling that I had!  Another grand book by Karen and as usual excellent narrator!!  Can‚Äôt wait for the next book!!,It took a long, long time for this book to get to Audible, but well worth the wait. I marvel at Sam Dewhurst-Phillips ability to have so many voices. I truly enjoyed the book.,Brilliant narrator! How does Sam Dewhurst-Smith do all those voices so well ?  Wonderfully written and great story line,,As always a great listen, this could easily be the best yet ! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one,Karen‚Äôs story‚Äôs are always brilliant ..

Sable Peak,"Small Town & Rural,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"I‚Äôve read all the Eden books and this one, when I read it, was one of my favorites and I was really looking forward to adding it to my audible library. The audible was great all the way up until ‚ÄúMateo‚Äôs‚Äù part. He obviously doesn‚Äôt do a lot of fiction since it seems as though he is reading an autobiography and not a romance. There is little to no emotion in his voice and I couldn‚Äôt make it through two chapters in his voice before I just stopped listening.,This was so good, not as steamy as the others but still emotional, and at times gut wrenching.,I did feel this was more Vera‚Äôs story than it was Mateo‚Äôs. But I didn‚Äôt mind that, it allowed Devney to take the story farther than just a single parent finding love. I will say I struggled with feeling frustrated towards Vera, she obviously had deep emotional trauma and could have used some therapy.,Can we normalize book characters getting therapy! Thanks. Regardless I enjoyed this.,As far as narration, the female narrator did fantastic, I always like her narrations. Ryan on the other hand, brought my rating down, his cadence was stiff and sing-song-y. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my annoyance with it and it kept pulling me out of the story.,What an emotional and soul-satisfying ending to the Eden Series.  Sable Peak by Devney Perry was a sweet and swoony romance with the perfect amount of spice and suspense.  I have loved every couple in this series, but Vera and Mateo may be one of my favorites.  Their journey to  HEA was full of pining and longing, and I enjoyed every bit of it.,,Samantha Brentmoor and Ryan Hudson perform this audiobook in dual narration.  Samantha Brentmoor blew me away with her passionate and heartfelt performance of Vera.  Her intonation and pitch for each character were expressive and had me feeling all of Vera's emotions. (Yes, lady!)  Ryan Hudson was a new-to-me narrator and while his voice varied for each character's dialogue, his overall narration lacked feeling, especially in intimate moments.,,Overall, I enjoyed this book.  If you are a fan of a small-town romance with a hunky pilot, a passionate heroine on a mission, an adorable two-year-old, a devoted family, hiking, unrequited love, slow-burn steamy times, emotional moments, and a HEA that will leave your heart happy then you will love Vera and Mateo's story.  I always look forward to more from Devney Perry.,I was expecting more from this one. If not for Crimson River there wouldn‚Äôt have been much to the characters. Vera had the potential to be a really interesting woman but the story‚Äôs momentum just fizzled out! Matteo seemed to have been a multilayered man in the previous books but it almost seemed as if the author couldn‚Äôt be bothered with character development.,And the male narrator was soooo terrible! He would be better suited to reading instruction manuals.,5‚≠êÔ∏è 3üå∂Ô∏è 4.5üéß,,Producer: One Night Stand,Narrators: Samantha Brentmoor + Ryan Hudson,Narration type: dual,Standard length: 9:43,Listening speed: 1.7x,,Tropes: small town, single dad, found family, love at first sight, unrequited love,,üìñ It‚Äôs the end. While I absolutely could not be happier with this book and how Devney tied up everything, I am so sad to say goodbye to these beloved characters. This book had such a different feel to the others, yet it still had everything you want in a book about the Edens! It was by far the most emotional for me, I was a crying mess a few different times. I really felt for Vera and everything she had been through, and then to pine for a man on top of it... I just wanted to squeeze her tight. I don‚Äôt always like unrequited love stories, but WOW, this one I not only liked I freaking loved it. Mateo Eden is next level, friends. If you‚Äôre looking for a man to support you, care for you, and worship you, this is the one! Bonus points to him for being a great son, brother, and father. Vera and Mateo‚Äôs relationship with his daughter was absolutely precious. And if you‚Äôre worried you won‚Äôt see the rest of the family, don‚Äôt be. Devney treated us to just the right amount of Eden family gatherings, sprinkling in some Easter eggs from past books. Absolutely loved it and if you haven‚Äôt already, pick this up!!,,üéß Samantha Brentmoor was the perfect pick for Vera. She has the voice, style, and skill for roles that have a lot of emotion and pain. Her voice has an incredibly natural cadence that makes you feel like your best friend is talking to you. That along with her breathy timbre and high impact emotional delivery have made her one of my very favorite narrators and this performance was one of her best!,This was my first time listening to Ryan Hudson. His dialogue voice fit Mateo well, it is medium in pitch and some rasp to it while not being too deep or harsh. He did well with showing emotions in the dialogue  parts for both Mateo and Vera. However, the narrator/internal monologue parts felt a bit off to me at times. The transitions were clear which is always helpful, but his cadence and inflection didn‚Äôt sound as natural to me, having somewhat of a sing song pattern. These portions lacked the clear emotion that came through in his dialogue as well. Overall his voice was really nice to listen to and he did fantastic during dialogue!,It‚Äôs sad that this series is ending. But this was a great story to end the Eden‚Äôs journey of finding their HEA.,Mateo and Vera‚Äôs story is swoony but a bit heartbreaking on Vera‚Äôs part. Devney‚Äôs writing really puts you on a journey of love, heartache, a bit of suspense. That‚Äôs what the Eden‚Äôs series have. Love every book and their stories.,Honestly, if you like romantic suspense books and you like it with a side of spice... You should read Devney Perry.,Final book in the Eden series did not disappoint. It tied up a ton of loose ends and finished up events that happened in Vance & Lila's story.,What to expect,‚úÖ Pining from a distance,‚úÖ Single dad,‚úÖ Found family,‚úÖ Suspense,‚úÖ Triggers for PTSD and discussion around substance abuse,‚úÖ No third act break up,Overall,Story ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Spice üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è,Audio üéßüéßüéß (she was fantastic... The male voice actor sounded way too robotic for me and not someone I would willingly listen too again),There are no words to sufficiently describe the love in my heart for this final book in THE EDEN SERIES. Devney has delivered the perfect ending to the Eden‚Äôs saga. Did she save the best for last?  Well, Mateo and Vera each stole my heart.  Little Allie melted it in a puddle. But together?  They own it.,Mateo is trying to find his true calling. His future in Quincy. He‚Äôs the Eden who left home. He‚Äôs a pilot. He loved living in Alaska. Flying. But with Allie, everything has changed. And as his feelings grow for Vera, he knows Quincy is truly his home.,Vera is dealing with dramatic past trauma, some of which is not resolved.  She feels broken. Can she pursue a relationship with the man she‚Äôs secretly loved for years with the secrets she‚Äôs hiding?  Is she ready to let Mateo in?,These narrators not only give us the main male and main female characters exceptionally but both can also carry off narrating the opposite sex characters brilliantly. And I‚Äôm a stickler for a female narrating a male character and vice versa. These two are wonderful in every way. Highly recommended.,,A great ending to a great series. Glad to hear Mattie and Vera‚Äôs story play out. I‚Äôll miss the Eden‚Äôs!,One of my favorite series.   However, the male narrator for this book was rough.   Zero emotion.    Still loved the story.,Loved the story and the narrators were excellent as usual. The description of Montana makes it the number one spot on my ‚Äòwant to visit‚Äô list.,Not entirely sure how I go on with knowing there isn‚Äôt another Eden novel is in the future. Perry, you‚Äôre amazing! Thank you x,Loved the story as always but had to switch to the kindle version once the male narration kicked in. It was near monosyllabic and sounded like they were reading a list rather than a sentence when not mimicking a characters voice.,This one had a slightly different feel which makes it a great edition to the series. Starts a bit slow but worth the wait. Enjoy the strength of Vera.,This was a great book. I really enjoyed the narration. It's the final book in the Edens series. Youngest brother Mateo finally gets his book. Vera is introduced in Crimson River and we get way more insight into her past. This book is emotional and heartbreaking in some parts. Vera has had a difficult life. I really liked this book, it's different from the other Edens books as it's very emotional and has lots of character building. The ending is brilliant and finishes the series up in a lovely way. I highly recommend this book. Make sure you read the other Edens books first. This isn't a standalone."

Fused,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The description for this one might as well be for a different book, not that it's a big deal. It's more about introspection and family matters than some kind of epic struggle as the description suggests. Nevertheless, it was still a good addition to the series and I'm sure most will like it.

Bonds of Blood,"Romance,Action & Adventure,Fantasy",LGBTQ+,"Bonds of Blood by Nazri Noor was truly an excellent and enjoyable addition to the Wild Hearts series. I was anticipating everything and I was so engaged with this audiobook. Greg Boudreaux as always did a fantastic job narrating and embodying each character perfectly, especially Loch and Sylvain's relationship dynamic! Loch, Sylvain, and their friends rise to the call of battle, yet this time around they have everything to lose if they do not excel in their quest. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book I will not spoil anything, but it is well worth the listen. Ultimately every book in this series has been engaging and so much fun! I have fallen in love with this series; I believe this is the last book of the series, but if not I look forward to more adventures. I look forward to future books by Nazri Noor!,,I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this audiobook.,The final book in the this series was definitely all I hoped it would be. There were a lot of twists and I couldn‚Äôt have predicted most of them at all. I would be hard pressed to choose a favorite from this world that nazri created but I can definitely say that I loved everything about the wispwood and am very excited to see how the other magical academies show up in future series.,There are several surprises in this book as Nazri brings this series to its conclusion. In addition to his found family, Loch learns more about his blood family. He will find out whether blood is thicker than water.,,The whole series is worth a listen! There are twists and turns, magical creatures, pocket dimensions, unexpected allies, steamy romance, magic, and more.,,Greg Boudreaux does a masterful job narrating this series! Worth the listen!,,I received a free copy of this audiobook for my honest review.,If this was the end of the Wild Hearts series, it was a wonderfully satisfying conclusion. That said, I hope our friends will see many more adventures together. Nazri Noor creates such marvelous characters that I actually miss them when their stories end. Noor and TJ Klune are my two favorite authors of all time, and given how much I read, that's saying something. I highly recommend this series.,It was very enjoyable as per usual. I really liked it but a part of me felt like it wasn't really the end.,I enjoyed the book as another installment in the series but not really as an ending. This book as the end book for the series left me a bit wanting."
Rise of the Weakest Healer,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Way too much detail of stats and game mechanics.  Try to follow the story was aweful. The book could have been halved.,OK I'm a little turned off by the fact that this does have a Harem aspect to it but I am also appreciative of the fact that it was done in such a way as to integrate it Without the overuse of some of the proper pronouns And it doesn't hit you over the head I do wish that The author had left a lot of it out because even though it is right for where it is at the same the shows A fear Of allowing himself to be shown as the kind of writer he truly isAnd it starts out as sort of a family friendly Venture there's no warning us of the possibility that there's going to be sex involved until it happensAnd the other thing is that when he does put the sex in it's slowly gets more graphic  Is going from,PG13 to NC17  to rated XX"
Defiant,"Action & Adventure,Space Opera",Teen & Young Adult,"Skud, this book was good. I blasted through the whole thing in one day with Suzy Jackson‚Äôs excellent narration letting me fly through.,The story brings Sanderson‚Äôs skill of accessible introspection and deep empathy into a realized universe that feels more and more to be Sanderson‚Äôs approach to voltron with each book. Defiant shares that series‚Äô brimming optimism and grand space opera setting despite going to some dark places and only just breaking through into the core of that universe.,While I loved it and Sanderson executes the tropes with flying colors, it does share some of the more optimistic tropes of Voltron (the recent one) and similar Saturday morning reimaginings. Some may be put off by it, but I still encourage newcomers to try the series and ANYONE who made it this far to strap and enjoy this conclusion to the Skyward Series. His unique take on this style of world and its hallmarks had me silently cheering, blubbering, and double taking at the different points.,‚Äî,The story was a delight and delivered on so many of the promises that the previous books made, offering a union of the two sides to the Skyward series thus far: The Girl and Her Companion Adventures, and the Crew of Friends Against the Galaxy. I loved the way these merged, continued, and were realized.,The narration is wonderful, and I love seeing Suzy execute on so many accents, styles, and viewpoints. She brings a life to this world that I‚Äôd miss on the page. I‚Äôm so pleased with how much she‚Äôs brought to this series.,I highly recommend the whole series‚Äîand do NOT skip the Skyward Flight Novelas. They add a LOT.,I started this series back in 2019 looking for a fun novel about space, and ""magic"" and fighting. As the books progressed it became increasingly clear the story was merely a backdrop for the fundamental story of understanding oneself, and empathizing with others through that better understanding. For those who have explored spirituality, this book surprisingly hits home in a lot of its key concepts and I found myself relating to the experiences of Spensa as she learned to explore her powers and how that helped deepen her bond with those around her.,if I'm honest, I relate far more to Spensa than a reasonable person should, being raised on Morte D'Arthur, Beowolf, the last stand of the 300, and such gave me a very similar outlook on the world for much of my life.,This book and the others in the series have made me laugh, cry, and just sit thinking about concepts for hours, far more than I can say most novels have. I can't recommend it enough, and for those willing to go deeper than just the words on the page, I hope it helps you feel you aren't alone, we see you, we hurt with you, we are here.,It's crazy how randomly stumbling across a book reviewer on YouTube (Murphy Napier) has not only introduced me to the works of Sanderson but has also introduced be to what is now my favorite book series. From the beginning, this futuristic story that started with a hyper imaginative thrill seeking girl attempting to repair her family's reputation and grew into a galactic war for the liberation of countless species, has had a choke hold on me and never let go.,Defiant was the perfect conclusion; everything that I enjoyed from the first three books and novellas plus an epic space battle that did not disappoint. Also, I am not ashamed to say that I was moved to tears once or twice.,Although this story has concluded, the ending sets up a follow up story with these characters and of course I can't wait to see what else is in store for them,we do infact like the slugs. The slugs do infact exist. This review is of the slugs.,Great conclusion to the series. Very satisfying ending. Some good laughs too. Excellent narration. Sanderson in his sweet spot.,I'm not a big YA or science fiction fan, but this series is fun, energetic, smart, and inspiring. The reader is among the best I've heard, giving a distinct voice to each main character.,First half of the book was essentially a recap of the rest of the series through some particularly cringey Spensa inner dialogue. I know its YA, but that doesn't mean you need to treat your audience like toddlers. There was also way more cutesy whedon speak than usual and some very weird and jarring changes to her personality. The second half alleviated some of these issues to bring the book more in line with the rest of the series for a decent conclusion.,What a great ending of the skyward series can‚Äôt wait to see the future of this world.,I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and their relationships. I love how he wrote the story from multiple points of view. Brandon Sanderson does an amazing job of helping you fall in love with his characters and feel the ups and downs of all their emotions! What a lovely story. I will recommend this series to everyone!,This was a great wrap up to the Skyward Series! I feel like every notable character from the stories or side-stories had at least some time onscreen, though I do wish some interpersonal relationships had more time to be explored between Spen and the new squad members, and it ended well!"

The performance was excellent. I will be looking for the next book.,Great characters with personality and complex interactions in an immersive story that makes you want to go there immediately!,this series is great I love following Joe and readinf/hearing how he accomplished his feats,Dakota is doing great ramping up to stakes but keeping Joe's skills strangely effective (just how I like it)!

The characters are hilarious and the concept is fun. A great read for those who just want to enjoy a good adventure without over analyzing everything.,This is the first novel in the series I didn't enjoy. The previous book (book 10) came out a month earlier and the quality in this one shows. Half of the book there is no plot, just our main character solving problems without an overarching story. And any resolution or character growth with our main character and his potential love interest is not addressed and thrown away by the end of the book. I honestly expected better.,The story was good but there‚Äôs no story anymore just a wall defense book. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs not interesting but if you fall asleep for 2 hour and start the book back up you really don‚Äôt miss anything. These characters and the author could do so much more.,Great story that felt balanced in all that I look forward to in this series. Action, humor, character and skill developments, the oddities of Jackson and other side characters, system responses, etc. Luke Daniels with an amazing performance for this arc.

Defiance of the Fall 11,"Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic,Cyberpunk",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Here's the issue: This series has suffered from a lack of focus since the third book. Now it's just spinning out of control. Hundreds of two-dimensional characters now fill the pages. Each has a weird name  and pops up at a random time. Readers might not have seen the character in question since the third book in the series, and those same characters might have only been seen seen in passing; yet, readers are expected to know them and their place in the plot. Best of all, readers aren't given any background to remind readers why said random character is suddenly central to the scene and storyline. It leaves readers with the sense they're watching a daytime soap opera rather than a well designed plot. J.F Brinks is drifting further and further from the core of the story. Was there even a plot in this book? There certainly wasn't a climax or resolution. This ""focus drift"" is becoming par for the course in litrpg. The last few books by big names like Zogarth and Shirtaloon. It's as if the authors prioritize page count over plot integrity. Also, where has the growth gone? If it takes 10 books for Zac to get through the ""E"" ranks, how long will it take him to get through the ""D"" ranks? Each rank is supposed to take longer than that of the one before, right. So what are we talking, 30 books for the ""D"" rank? There is no chance this series can hold readers attention for that long, especially as J.F. Brinks diverges further and further from the main character and main storyline. And what about ranks  ""C,"" ""B,"" and ""A?"" If Brinks want to tell the story of Zac's rise to supremecy, we might be looking at hundreds of books at this rate. It's a bummer. The core story is interesting enough to create a solid series; but if this ""focus drift"" continues, it'll lead to a diminished readership, and, eventually, an unfinished story.,This book was much better than the last. I really felt like the story was starting to go off course but this book reeled it back in for me. It also felt like we got a whole lot more story this time. I'm happy that We will finally get some actual progress. Overall this was an excellent installment similar to the earliest books in the series. Keep up the good work.,(Spoiler) Book 11 in the series and Zack is STILL not a D grade cultivator, but he‚Äôs ‚Äúright at the peak‚Äù of E and ready to go‚Ä¶ So frustrating. It‚Äôs like intercourse without the climax.,But, this is still a great addition to the series. A lot of great things happening and a lot of familiar characters converging together again. Looking forward to the next book already.,Can‚Äôt wait for the next audio-book to come out I grab this series every time it‚Äôs released looking forward to more!,great book can't wait to read the next one in the series and to see what is next,The series gets better with every book I hope there‚Äôs 10 more to come love the story,I love the progression it's amazing it's so fascinating the way you write it keep up the good work.,I loved this book, it was great like they all have been‚Ä¶ BUT I kinda hate that it cuts off right before the Perennial Vastness rather than after.,8/10 from that,I've been enjoying every moment of this series. I can't wait to find out what Zach does next.,my only real complaint. its book 11. no hook required. there good stories. fifteenth word.,Great book and great narrator! constant action and very engaging storyline. I can't wait for the next one!,I struggled to get into this volume at first. I dont really remember anything positive or interesting happening, just a lot of loose ends being woven together and the next adventure being set up. The hero progressed somewhat but this volume lacked a compelling narrative.,If you want an excellent cultivation/litrpg genre, with great world building and character development, this series is for you.,loved the constant advancements. love that his bestie is back. lol. the demon is the key to banter.,Although the quality of the writing jumps a little as some of the stories set the scene in a lot of detail ,and so the action is missed ,the overall story works well ,and the world building is integral to the story. This does leave you wanting more all the time but then again this might not suit a lot of people.,The overall qualith of narration never changes once you make it past book 1 however and Pavi always does a audio well so no complaints there.,My biggest complaint is also the same complement as the series is getting quite large now and the timing between releases always feels too short.,Book 11 and still going strong! I just want more and more!,Pavi did an incredible jobs as always,Not much to say except... its so good. Vast and has a great depth to cultivation as well story,This series goes from strength to strength. can't wait for the next one.,this is definitely up there with my favourite series.,these books are getting better with each that comes and leave you wanting more I hope that number 12 will come soon and won't be the end,Sure, I get it. The multiverse isn't the same place as Earth. It's a dog-eat-dog (or barghest eat barghest) world out there and the strong survive. However, there is a tipping point in this book where Zach goes full fascist dictator and just starts killing humans that don't agree with his take-over of the whole planet. He is a guy who was absent for decades and just ignores anyone not in his little circle of confidants. It surely attracts the Trumpian element in some readers but it is not even a political view to choose to talk to people instead of having them killed outright because they object to your world domination Yes there is a war brewing. Yes the heavens are ruthless.. There are billions of people that are now his ""subjects""and positioning yourself as a ruthless dictator and snorting away their objections, without a substantial political and military apparatus in place to suppress the masses and a network of cronies to do your bidding his plans for a meritocratic utopia will end in tears, There's always a bigger fish and no matter how powerful his ax swing is or how many Dao branches he cultivated, Zach will end up as a mass murderering tyrant or he will be deposed by more powerful factions that may or may not be benevolent to the rest of mankind. In any case, as a main character, I can't really root for Zach and his attempts to attain ascension anymore. Glorifying fascism simply doesn't appeal to me.,This instalment DRAGS.... it's very unenjoyable and slow. a complete failure to make any battle interesting. absolute slog to get through.,J F Brink is in a league of his own. Best litrpg series out there. Pavi and Brink the dream team,Sure... write a bridging book but if you are going to do that at least provide lots of good background content.  By the end of the series this will be a book people tell you just to skip.,I‚Äôve no idea how they‚Äôre writing, recording and producing these so quick at such an awesome quality but I‚Äôm happy about it. Awesome performance, I‚Äôm hooked for the next book.,,Also really appreciate how long these are. Really makes buying the next book a no brained when I‚Äôm getting 20+ hours of constant entertainment.,I pre-ordered this book because i really like the series. i've listened to the first 9 books 3-5 times (more re-reads for the first ones) and the 10th book twice. This one i don't even feel like listening to for a second time unfortunately. i struggled to finish it. i can't get a sense of progression to the story in a way. everything was too convenient. i don't know. probably my last book for the series.,Top quality cultivation goodness, this is a solid 10/5 entry to the series. Only a contrarian would rate lower than 5 stars, needless to say this is the one review worth reading. This is a must listen,Some good fights, some good base building, and some good character development. The parts where you follow secondary characters is abit to clumped together but other than that a great addition to the series.,Another great book!,Was great for slowing down and tiring up a lot of the loose ends that have built up over the first 10 books! As well as set the stage for what‚Äôs gonna be one of the biggest arcs yet!! Can‚Äôt wait for more!!!!,Things keep heating up and such a great grouping of themes. Just good listening . Really love it,bring on book 12.,10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0"

"Summer, 1976",,,"The two narrators were so likable so real the story could have been my life for your life for anyone‚Äôs life. It was realistic at first I thought the ending was going to disappoint, but boy was I wrong.,There were strange aspects to this recording that made me think it was a first draft (repeated sections etc). The Audible Plus selections often seem to have issues hence they are free.,This one is worth a listen, but it wasn‚Äôt as good as I hoped. I liked hearing the two perspectives of the characters. I think most people will relate to the story of friendship and its challenges. I found the narration to be a bit melodramatic.,I gave birth on July 2, 1976. (Everyone asked why I didn‚Äôt wait til the 4th to have a Bicentennial baby) but I digress‚Ä¶.it was like I was there. Women of any age will relate. Bravo!,Incredible performance of a big story-sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking-told in a short amount of time.,The story was bad.  Only the titles of books had anything to do with 1976.,I‚Äôm a Laura Linny fan, so this was a treat. Both performed well the complexities of friendship. I only wish that it would be a fully fleshed out novel. The interior monologues of each daughter would be interesting. Ôøºin 1976 I was an academic, and young. We meet people along our way who leave an indelible mark on our lives.,I liked the realness of the characters.  I wish the male character was narrated by a male voice. That would have made the conversation easier to follow.,I liked the honesty. The women‚Äôs friendship was fragile from the start. Although they each longed for a deep connection, life held them back.,I‚Äôm so glad this was released through Audible as I‚Äôd never get the opportunity to see the play in person. Laura Linney and Jessica Hecht are as brilliant as you‚Äôd imagine and the characters are rich. It‚Äôs funny, thoroughly entertaining and just gently heartbreaking. Will definitely listen again"

The Primal Hunter 7 - A LitRPG Adventure,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"That had to be the most iconic end for this series. Also this was definitely a great addition to the series as a whole.,it's a sad waste.  two books in a row barely moving the plot.  good but it's not satisfying story movement.,Top 3 litrpg series. Can't wait for the next one. Jake, Silvie and Villy rock.,Greatest series ever read! The writing is inspirational and the performance is spectacular. NEED MORE!!,Amazing book another great entry and a damn good cliff hanger. My boy even got laid.,It was a good continuation of the book and story development for multiple characters and world building. Fun read overall.,Everything is just so likable i dont mind just listening to them do mundane chores as random things happen spontaneously. Of course Baldree brings in a LOT of character to the voices so that helps immensely. I want and need more.,If you love this series, you‚Äôre going to love this it‚Äôs one of the best books out there,I‚Äôve been enjoying the series since the first book and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next. Please continue the amazing work!,I loved it CANT wait for the next one I‚Äôm hoping for more school plot,I didnt expect this book to be so bad , there is no story just main caracter talking to himself , this is just a filler,Really enjoyed Jakes progress in this book. I hope book 8 won't disappoint me.,Great listen, could listen again and again. Can't wait for the next one, worth the purchase.,What I don't like is having to wait so long for the last book to come out!! Faster faster please!!,7 books in and I'm still impatiently wanting more... Should be enough of a testament to the quality of this series! Honestly love it and highly recommend it.,I found the last installment of this series a thoroughly enjoyable listen but it started to stray away from the crazy and inventive new ideas I really love being exposed to in fantasy. This book brought new layers to the world the story takes place in and expanded on characters within it in ways I really enjoy and look forward to seeing fulfilled.,,It kindled my passion for this series to new heights when I didn't realise it had waned to begin with.,Not too much to say, it's more of the same.  Things are happening and we even get a new enemy but it's been a few days since I finished it and I've forgot most of it already.  I do go straight to a new book once I've finished so that doesn't help.,Bottom line is, if you enjoyed the others you'll enjoy this is felt like a solid addition.,Very cool book with great characters and a fun way of exploring the expanding universes with majestic stories,Really enjoying seeing how Jake goes from situation to situation and following his progress. Easy to listen to with some very good action, humour, twists and story.,The story is brilliant, all the characters are just as fun to hear about as always. Travis Baldree does a great job with especially with the viper. Who is leading our hero slowly but surely to alcoholism.,really great points out of nowhere with odd but enjoyable humour and overall just a really good book and overall performance from the voice actor,Pure enjoyment from start to end, great development and some new introductions. Tickle me pink I'm excited for the next one,It was great and I recommend it to teenagers or tweens so be sure to listen to it,I absolutely love this series. Binged all 7 books and can't wait for the next one.,Really enjoyed the book, the story and pace the characters. Everything. Had me hooked every second!,love the seamless world building and engaging characters, this series keeps me coming back time and again!,Absolutely fantastic as per usual! Cannot wait until the next book is released now! ü§ì highly recommend starting this series,This has been one of the best fantasy series.  I feel compelled to leave a review as this series gives a fresh view on the genre and I look forward to the next books!,Really enjoyed this contuation of the storyline. Keep it up and can‚Äôt wait for the next one.,Another book i almost binged from start to finish, hardly willing to ever put the book away. Loved every second of it! keep up the good work."

Dead Reckoning,"Military,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I love this series and have been eagerly anticipating this book and I wasn't disappointed. Paul Heitsch is masterful as usual, it is hard to believe so many distinct sounding personalities all come from one person. As for the story, I had fun as always.  Some of the over arching plot lines were advanced, and there was the usual boom boom explody fun. The characters are great as always and the interactions between the crew often caused me to laugh out loud, which is one of the things I love about the series,This was the best story in a while. And that‚Äôs not knocking any of the parts with the rebellion, as those were really all a good arc, but this is classic omega force and just good stuff. As always, I hate to finish because it means I have to wait for the next.,Just top notch from both Josh and Paul.,I like it, a lot. Bumble Nums rule! So that‚Äôs eight words. Two more? I guess not.,The camera pans out and the colours fade to shades of silver...our heroes stand at a precipice... what fates await them?,This one is the best since Omega Rising. Every member of the team had his moment to shine. Great story and execution. Great integration of supporting characters as well. I'd give this one 5+ stars if I could.,Love the stories.   Can't wait for the next one!  Is the machine in the background pulling the strings?  Maybe...,Amazing from beginning to end! After 14 books, if  15 is the last, this is an amazing conclusion. Back stories from previous books are answered, as well as setting up plots for new adventures! Would love to see this made into a movie franchise!,Yet again an awesome story following the crew through their adventures. The storyline keeps getting more complex without it being taxing to the reader. Looking forward to the next book!,There is nothing special or unusual about this entry into the series.  The voice performance, as always is top notch.  Story-wise it feels like filler needed to set up a larger upcoming yet-to-be revolved narrative.,That said, I listened to the whole thing almost non-stop as this is one of my favorite series.,love this series and its charters. I'm always left wanting more suck I have to wait for the next scout fleet book aswell,Love the omega force blend of humour action and sci fi and friendships can‚Äôt get enough"

Thesaurize,Action & Adventure,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"1. The repeated shafting of the main character to just fix it with plot armor later has got so stupid. The author constantly gives the MC these random bonuses  that are okay but always has a negative side effect it takes away something twice as valuable. it's like how is this supposed to be a ""reward""?,What a great duo Dakota K. and Like D. make. This Theasaurize brought back some elements I've come to enjoy about the books. Especially, Joe:s love of jo.,Another good book by Dakota krout, thanks for the great story and I hope the next one is just as good or better thank you!,buy it still good if you like previous books then worth it too lazy to give full review,also don't forget some of your plot points from the first books, there is a habit of things going willy nilly I love parts of it, but sometimes it feels very disjointed, maybe take a round to pull and tie some threads together?,love the series and the character progression throughout all of the books. really keeps me in tune and always hungry for more.,we're back to everything i enjoy in the series. great installment! i was satisfied with each aspect. i wonder why Joe hasn't spoken with Tatum the whole book... i don't remember a reason why they wouldn't be having whole conversations...,This book continues to build story while staying true to the characters they are building. The depth and dynamics of the characters is solid.,I really love this series!,while there are few books I actually like an stick with this series has me by the brain I can't tell you how many times I have used mate's noise Jackson wasn't as prominent in this book but still felt relative to the story hope the rest of the guild an maybe mom joins soon?,I enjoy this series and all the laugh and turns that come with it. Dakota does a great job in writing character with unique,Luke is the perfect narrator for Dakota's books. I will say I look forward to the bloopers reel at the end.,Halted story progression just a side quest, too focused on main characters narcissistic development that is becoming too repetitive . Other characters and worlds timeline ignored, Just place holder mentions for guild and dwarf progression but even that is very vague.,If writing continues like this It will just become an expensive comic. Its book ten I would not recommend starting this series unless books are bundled as it is not good value for money compared to other authors in this type of creative space.,Well written and performed full of bad jokes ( sum time there catch you and get a snicker )and adventure"

God of Fury,Romantic Suspense,Romance,"Niko and Bran are my favorite. This was everything I wanted and more. I laughed and cried. The emotions from the VA‚Äôs hit me to my core. I will be listening again and again.,I have read all of the Gods of Legacy books and this one has to be hands down my favorite. The love they grow and the way they helped each other. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Rina's debut novel in the MM genre is a fantastic read that will leave you wanting more. To fully appreciate Bran and Nikolai's journey, I recommend reading the previous Legacy of Gods books.,Bran is a complex character who struggles with his inner demons, stemming from past experiences. Despite his challenges, he prioritizes others' wellbeing above his own, often at the cost of his own mental health. A selfless act to protect his brother, Landon, leads him into the hands of Nikolai.,Nikolai, on the other hand, is the headstrong and ruthless heir to a mafia empire with his sights set on Bran.,The chemistry between Bran and Nikolai is captivating, and their relationship will leave readers rooting for them. I, for one, am eagerly anticipating Ava and Eli's story.,I laughed, cried and died a little with this story. It was so beautiful. The push and pull was perfectly balanced. I'd pay good money over and over again to hear Shane East say mafia. I loved the full cast. The way that you can tell the story without giving away major plots in others is amazing.,I genuinely have no words for the emotional roller coaster this book took me on. I laughed. I cried. I turned into a freaking puddle for the absolute love and adoration and psycho devotion Niko had for Bran! This book was everything! My absolute favorite in the series so far and I can‚Äôt express that enough! The narration just made me love both characters that much more! üò≠,I can‚Äôt review this without going off on a million tangents and spoiling the whole book so all I‚Äôll say is that this baby was a masterpiece and I loved every dang second of it! I hope you give it a listen because doing the audio was 1000000% worth it!,I loved them soooooo much. Nikolai and Brandon are officially my favorite couple ever. They are everything,The most precious relationship. The way they get to know each other, grow for each other ‚ù§Ô∏è,I've read plenty of Rina Kent's books and this, by far, is my favorite!! My first MM read and I am over the moon about it. it was more than I expected it to be. Nikolai's and Brans hit and miss relationship is one that endured to end regardless of all the challenges. I truly love a really good love story. Ohh.... The 2nd prologue was one of my favorites. The voices were just perfect and I bought both audiobook and the book and read it together and it was thee best purchase I've made since my since of membership. Totally recommend reading and listening at the same time for a much deeper, personal, touching experience. The voices were just the perfect touch to this love story. The emotions they were able to express were spectacular and so raw. I felt every thing through their story telling. Thank you for the wild experience!!!!,Omg....my first MM book and I fell in love.. Can I just say that I love Niko? Yes.. he is chaotic but he is so honest with his feelings.. I love that he was there for Bran and I loved it when his humor as well. He is such an adorable puppy sometimes lol The push and pull is so angsty but the way they gravitate toward each other... The tension is amazing in this book!!,I loved everything about God of Fury!!!!

He's Not My Type,"Sports,Romantic Comedy",Literature & Fiction,"I dont know where to start. The audiobook was better then a movie. The cast and friendship and brotherhood among the teammates is heartwarming. This book is hilarious, sexy, sad and spicy. But most of all in centers around kne mans grief and how he overcame it with finding love and support from family of his choice and not by blood. I loved loved loved this story! It is a must read or listen!,,Meghan is my favorite author and her book with this cast was everything!!! I literally laughed out. So good!,I am not sure I will have the words for how much I loved this book. First I need to shout out how amazing the narrators were. Erin Mallon has been a favorite of mine for many years as has Jason Clarke and Teddy Hamilton. JF Harding is absolutely growing on me and I am loving his work that I have heard lately. Kelsey Navarro-Foster is new for me and I loved her. But for me the complete standout for this full cast audio is CONNOR CRAIS. This man blew me away with his performance and I am not sure I will ever get over this book.,,Prior to this book, Untying the Knot was my top favorite Meghan Quinn audiobook. I will say that I have loved all her books, some a bit more than others. But now HNMT is my #1 MQ story. I have no idea how she will top this book but it will be fun to see her try.,,I loved Blakely and Halsey's story so much. I think I loved it so much because Halsey fell first and fell hard. He had an immediate crush on Blakely from the moment they met...then he found out she had a boyfriend. Then a year later Blakely is single and is in need of a place to stay as her apartment has some water damage/issues. With the help of his teammates/friends, it is suggested that Blakely stay with Halsey since he has the room.,,Too bad for Halsey that he's just not Blakely's type...or so she thinks. What starts off as friends/roommates turns into the ""only one bed"" trope we know and love. The more time Blakely spends with Halsey, the more she sees the real Halsey. Pretty soon one bed is all that they will need.,,I loved seeing Halsey find his person. With the way his family treated him after his brother passed, he was just not the same guy. Blakely helped pull the old Halsey out of his self-induced shell, where he could truly be happy again. Halsey absolutely deserved to be as happy as possible and Blakely made that happen.,,There were so many times I laughed out loud while listening to this story and I couldn't love it more. Teddy Hamilton's portrayal of Posey was absolute perfection. And as I have already said, Connor stole the show for me. I really need more Connor for future MQ books. I know he has narrated a few but I NEED MORE!!!!,I absolutely love Meghan Quinn and even though I feel like her books follow the same ‚Äúformula‚Äù,  you know, boy meets girl and so much sexual attention‚Ä¶. They start to fall and BAM, WE CAN‚ÄôT BE TOGETHER‚Ä¶.for what ever reason (seems silly). However, this book did NOT! I loved how Blakely and Halsey were stronger than the drama and were able to love each other until the very end.,Fresh. Funny. Fabulous. He's Not My Type turns romantic comedy on it's heart. Quinn gives an endearing salute to love. With a sardonic sense of humor, an irresistible cast of characters and the tempting unpredictability of romance, the Vancouver Agitators set a course to win hearts everywhere. With the charming, vocal styles of Crais and Mallon, as well as a few surprises along the way, Halsey and Blakely turn delightful fun into unforgettable. A can't put down crowd pleaser.,,This is a reread. I absolutely loved reading the book. And had to listen to the audiobook right away.,I love the entire cast. I freakin LOVE Conner Crais. My lawd. That Man‚Äôs voice. I think his voice matches Halsey perfectly.  That almost monotone but not monotone voice. Perfect Halsey.,Erin Mallon as Blakely was great too.,I loved it was a duet narration plus a full cast. Absolutely loved the other narrators as well. Some of my favorites. I feel like I might have to listen again soon.,""Those Three Little Words"" (the last Meghan Quinn book I read) was such a drawn-out story with so much excessively manufactured drama/unlikable characters that I never thought I'd pick up another one of her books. Then, I saw that Connor Crais was narrating this book, and I very hesitantly decided to give it a try. I‚Äôm glad I did; it was a great story and well done, especially for the heavy topics it touched.,The narration was great, and Connor Crais, of course, absolutely knocked it out of the park!,,Story ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,Spice üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è,üìñvsüéß The was a great listen & Read,This book did not disappoint! The narration in the book was great I loved hearing the original cast from the previous books as well as the addition to a new main character to the friend circle which makes me hope for another love story. As usual these books absolutely cracked me up and the butterflies were non stop. The struggle with loss and acceptance in this book felt so real pressing a bit deeper into other emotions than the other books.,This is my favorite book from the agitators series!!! I love the connection between the two main characters and their chemistry. So good!,I never give reviews but this one deserves one. I have listened to many many audio books and have read more books than I can remember. This is easily the BEST book I have listened to this year! I wish I could listen to it again for the 1st time. I also, wish I could read it without knowing any details for the first time.,I chose this title for an easy, take my mind off stress, light hearted sports romance. I did not read or listen to any of the other books in the series first either. Good Lord was I in for a pleasant surprise!! I laughed out loud. Then laughed some more. The banter and humor literally had me in tears. Then the deep feelings and conversations. The heavy topic and emotional toll of loss hit me. The raw, heart searing content mixed with the humor was unreal. The emotional growth displayed and the conversations surrounding grief was so expertly written. This book took me for a loop. I cried and laughed then cried some more. The ending is chef‚Äôs kiss. The cast nailed this!!,Well done!! Well done!!,Now to go back and listen to or read the rest!!,I found this the best one out of all 4. Loved the way it was recorded and really lovely characters!,Really enjoyed how all 4 books came together to create a lovely end to the story!,This is an engaging story brought to life by a stellar cast, including Connor Crais, Erin Mallon, Teddy Hamilton, Jason Clarke, J.F. Harding, and Kelsey Navarro-Foster. The audiobook skillfully captures the humor, camaraderie, and sizzling chemistry between characters like Halsey Holmes and Blakely White. Quinn's writing and the dynamic ensemble create a perfect balance of laughter, steamy moments, and emotional depth. The teammates' interference in Halsey's romantic pursuit adds a comedic touch, and the story evolves into a heartwarming exploration of friendship and love. This audiobook is a must-listen, showcasing Quinn's talent in delivering captivating and multifaceted romantic comedies.,I listened to this in one sitting it was epic! It's my fav of the series. I adored getting to know Halsey and learning more about him and his past. He's always been such a mystery until now. The connection he had with Blakely was off the scale. I really enjoyed the progression between them as it wasn't an instant connection, you could feel the romance blossoming. They had great chemistry and some great banter. The group texts, as always, were my favourite in this story. I was howling with laughter. I possibly looked a bit crazy to anyone seeing me with my headphones in. The ending though, omg I cried at the end! Meghan, you really broke my heart with that ending! In true Meghan style, you put me back together again after. This was an absolute belter of a story, and the all cast audio really nailed it. There were some of my favourite narrators doing the audio, and they really brought the story to its full glory. Loved it!,This is one of those books you wish you could read again and it was the first time. Loved it!!!,I would liked it to the story be longer. I liked to see more of his family.,iv been waiting for Halsy to get a book, and what a book it is. with laugh out loud bits and deep areas exploring mental health it was great. the performance in duet is amazing and definitely the way forward, and the ensemble cast just made it a delight to listen to. especially if you have listened to the other books. can not wait foe the next book and hope it in the same format!,Halsey plays hockey professionally with the Agitators who is still trying to heal from a devastating loss. His life revolves around hockey, books, his teammates and his secret crush on Blakely who became off limits when he found out she had a boyfriend. When the relationship ends, and she needs a place to stay his teammates decide the best way for him to win her heart is by having her become his roommate.,,When Blakely‚Äôs long-time boyfriend decided to accept a job in Australia without talking to her she decided she didn‚Äôt want to leave her friends or her job at the Agitators. She now finds herself in a bind needing a place to stay when Halsey opens his home to her, and she realizes that there is much more to this nerdy hockey player than she could have imagined.,,The chemistry between them is hot, the banter between them and the banter between Halsey and his teammates was hilarious but there is also an emotional pull to this story that will have you hoping that Halsey will find the happiness and peace that he deserves. The wonderful cast of narrators only makes this heartwarming and humorous story that much better.,Such good book; hot, intense, enchanting, full of everything that makes a book worth listening üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,Love this series, made me laugh out loud & cry all mixed with wonderful spice! Great story telling with a star studded cast, looking forward to book five!,,He's Not My Type is a must-read for anyone who craves a good romantic comedy with a strong sports element. I highly recommend it to fellow friends to lovers fans who are in their hockey romance era. Not only is the main couple just adorable but the friend group with their loveable interference and support warmed my cold heart. There is heaviness here amongst the love and laughs.,Performed in duet, with an ensemble cast of fabulous narrators, it was a no-brainer purchase. Storyline kept me listening and the cast of characters were hilarious. I especially love the text chats and locker room interventions from his team mates. Posie is my favourite and I can't wait for his book. Fun, romantic, super spicy with an emotional twist near the end that had me sitting in my car crying. I highly recommend this book.,Read this on Kindle first- Loved it,Grabbed it on audio because I love a full cast book- it's awesome just get it!,Excellent narration and I loved the extra cast. Great story with funny interactions and touched on the challenges of moving forward from tragic grief, noting it is not a straight road and each experience is different.,Loved the multiple narrator. üòç üëå,This story had me in fits of laughed at times. What a great read. My disappointment was that it dragged out towards the end as nothing really happened üôÉ"

Sea of Souls,"Adventure,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I love the dawn of fire book series but man this book and the last one (book 6) absolutely skip!,This book kills off interesting characters that were started in book 5 with no pay off or any kind of progress to the plot. it is not until the last 10 minutes of the book that some form of interesting plot development actually happens. This book is literally  10hrs of just mindless filler GW please can we get some real plot development!,,This is part of a series, right?  Chris is usually a great author, but this is meh at best.,This book contributes nothing to the Dawn of Fire series, like how Damnation of Pythos added nothing to the Horus Heresy.,disappointed for the 1st time by Chris.,big time filler with a bunch of nobody's doing absolutely nothing for 12 hours. just really meh big time meh,I have very rarely listened to so much writing that said absolutely nothing of consequence. Chris wraight has produced some damn good books before but this is utter garbage. Almost every dawn of fire novel has been a flaming dumpster fire up to this point but this was an especially pointless book. The ending heavily implies a factor of significance . . . in some far off abstract future but it was mostly irrelevant as well.,I don‚Äôt understand where the overall story is going with these books. No one book is related to the book before it. It‚Äôs not like the Horus heresy series. This whole book could have been a short story.,If you go into this book expecting a detailed look at the Indomitus Crusade, you will be disappointed. Honestly they should have just put this out as a stand-alone 40k horror novel set within the Indomitus era. If you go in understanding that this is a standalone novel that belongs in the Warhammer Horror series, you will get a fantastic novel with a ton of great scenes and explorations of lore. If you‚Äôre an Imperial Navy fan, this book is a must. Narration is amazing, and they add in some fun audio effects that definitely add to the atmosphere.,Sea of Souls is a very good look into how an Imperial Navy ship runs, but if you are just here for Dawn of Fire proper, this book won't tide you over. Outside of a few bits, this is more Dawn of Fire adjacent than a mainline book and that is the biggest problem with the series.,The narrator did a great job the occasional vox bursts added a lot to the experience as did an alcoholic sister of battle (which is hilarious) but I‚Äôll be honest this book is nothing but a bunch of words that lead to a sword from the beginning of treachery finally being put into someone‚Äôs Hand. Unfortunately the epilogue does more for this book than the book itself.,I know my lore well and I was confused all the way up until the very end nothing ever seems to fall into place and make sense. I understand that‚Äôs probably intentional to some degree because you‚Äôre supposed to get the same confused scared sense the crew has but it doesn‚Äôt come across like you‚Äôre supposed to feel that way, it‚Äôs more of a confusing jumble of events. The start of the book is great you definitely feel there on the bridge but as it progresses you feel like you‚Äôve lost touch with the story.,This started out so well. Wraight is an excellent author but the end was so disappointing. The epilogue in particular felt tacked on just to connect to the rest of the Dawn of Fire series.,holy cow that one was dark. I gotta fill the rest of this out cause it requires a fifteen word minimum and I'm not sure what else to say that wouldn't be a spoiler..,And to me it was more a gothic horror set onboard an imperial ship than a story in the dawn of fire series, only in the last chapters and epilogue do you get a link to previous DoF books, really enjoyed it and John Banks is an excellent narrator,I hate all the effects for the ""warpvoices""/voxcaster, the readers is doning a fine jobb otherwise,I didn't expect one of these novels to go Event Horizon.,But they did and it's not badly done.,This audiobook failed to capture my attention with long boring linear and bureaucratic passages. I had difficulties understanding what is going on, where who what is happening. Halfway through I might give up."

I felt like I watching a really  good Christmas movie!,Adorable characters with a good story! Whether taking a break from holiday prep with a hot chocolate or gearing up for a day of shopping with a coffee and biscotti- this is a great feel-good holiday rom-com. Don't miss out!,Eric and Lucy have a crazy time getting home for Christmas.  Along the way they make new over the top friends in a quaint little town.  You will laugh out loud at the antics.  The narrators do a fabulous job.,Hangry Lucy,Christmas karaoke,Honeymoon shag-swag,Not-TedDanson,80s power ballads,True crime obsession,,This was my kind of frothy peppermint hot cocoa Christmas rom-com until the final hour which needlessly delayed the HEA with Lucy‚Äôs self-sabotage. Still, even the conflict was fairly low-angst and ended up a mere speed bump on the way to a sugarplum finish. The nooky was more nice than naughty (practically cozy) ‚Ä¶ just the way I prefer for holiday novellas where heart and humor matter most.,First off - the narration: You cannot go wrong with amazing performers like Andi Arndt and Jason Clarke. They are wonderfully talented and bring every book to life. This was no exception. From the frustration of the circumstances, embarrassment, steamy moments, vulnerability, and the levity their timing is perfection and I loved it from beginning to end!,,The story itself is super cute. This story is on the short side, but packs in a full story arc that doesn't feel rushed. I love the characters and the storyline. The town of Tinsel becomes another character, which I love. Great side characters also bring more life to the story and had me giggling out loud. Lovely holiday listen!,This was a nice story to listen to. Loved Eric‚Äôs character & all the ones in  Tinseltown. Good narration.,I started this story because it was free.  I'm so glad I did. it was Funny and a nice easy listen. with great narration.,If you like to laugh out loud in the car while listening to a book, this is the one for you! The romance, the wit, and the  hilarious places and people the two main characters experience will keep you entertained and wanting for more.,What happens when the guy you ghosted after a one night stand ends up being the guy you get stranded in a quirky town with? This is a cute, spicy and fun holiday romance. Fun side characters and a couple you can‚Äôt help but root for! This one took me by surprise with how much I enjoyed it. Andi Arndt and Jason Clarke are the dream team of narrators and bring this holiday tale to life.,Okay, this was the cutest little read! It was short and sweet and I loved it.,When you‚Äôre ride sharing with the guy you ghosted last month, how bad could it be? How awkward could it be? Lol,Lucy and Eric were perfect together, they had a rough start, they both had baggage they needed to deal with and they both saw something in each other that they needed!,This little town of Tinsel sounds like something right out of a hallmark movie‚Ä¶. If hallmark was full of sexed up old people! Hahahaa like there wasn‚Äôt a young person insight, except for Lucy and Eric! Like the island of misfit toys, this was the island of old horny people!,Perfect ending to a super cute book!,Perfect for Christmas listening while wrapping gifts. Well written and well read. Would recommend to Christmas and romance lovers.,If you‚Äôre not feeling Christmasy then this is the book for you! It‚Äôs given me all the feelings! Definitely recommend!,I enjoyed listening to this Christmas rom com while getting up to some festive chores around the house. I found the male narrators voice for Lucy very cringey and the story intensely cliche but really enjoyable nonetheless!,I loved this story so much, funny and romantic, with a wonderful cast of eccentric supporting characters in the town of Tinsel.,There is a small steamy section within the book, but if, like me, you're already a huge fan of both narrators, this is far more euphemistic than the kind of Romance novels they usually narrate, but it may be a surprise to anyone who usually listens to ""closed door"" romances.,For me, this was a brilliant listen, and one I will happily listen to again, and again.,feel good christmas hit with a will they won't they vibe, enjoyable read. would recommend this,The story is light, funny and romantic. The characters are very likeable and the story is sweet.,This wasn‚Äôt my vibe!! I thought it could be way more Christmassy for a Christmas romance!!

Lovely Christmas romance book - bit raunchy at times!,All round brilliant book, good read , great story perfect length to listen to highly recommend,10/10 amazing you couldn‚Äôt predict what was going to happen loved listening to it all the way,I really liked the main characters, Lucy & Eric. They had great interactions, communicated well for the most part the story flowed well. There were open door love scenes, which I'd rate ü™≠ü™≠ü™≠/5, but it added to the story & not detract it. The side characters were likeable & I had a good laugh over the tiger portrait. I listened to this through Audible Plus, but it's now on my to buy list as I know this is a book I'd read again. The narrators are two of my favourites, so the way they brought the characters to life enhanced my enjoyment of the story.,Male narrator spoilt it so fast. I couldn't finish it. Story showed promise, although highly predictable, but he just doesn't have the acting skill of other good narrators. Leave him for the erotica genre. Please.,Schmaltzy, predictable and delightful. Tis the season! I‚Äôm decorating the tree and listening to this. I am‚Ä¶. content xx,The narrators did not do a good job on this one. There was no connection, so cheesy and predictable,I really loved this. Easy to listen to and not too predictable. Just the right amount of Christmas magic ‚ù§Ô∏è,Wonderful Christmas story, funny, captivating, and easy to follow. Perfect for the overload mind in the holiday season.,I throughly enjoyed this lighthearted story. It captured the Xmas spirit and gave me the feeling of the joy and goodwill.,Witty and totally enjoyable story that I just couldn‚Äôt stop listening to. Was to short I wanted it to keep going.,I don't know why I loved this one so much.... Maybe because both of the  MCs weren't insufferable like cheesy stories are normally like... They were both likeable and you wanted them to strive. I'd definitely listen again! X"

These Rough Waters,"Contemporary,Romantic Suspense",Romance,"I had the opportunity to read this book a few months ago but the performance Troy and Janine do is just so amazing. They made me fall in love with the story all over again.,What a great start to the Ravenpeak Series.,This book will have your emotions all over the place.  Torin just wants to stay secluded and hidden after his tragedy, and Maya is running from her nightmare.  When Torin catches Maya and her daughter as stowaways, he never thought his heart could open up again.  This book is packed with emotion, chemistry, and suspense.   Please check your trigger warnings.   The audiobook is narrated by Troy Duran and Janine Granda. They did a phenomenal job. Troy captured Torin‚Äôs broody, angry side so well. Janine had me feeling all the ways with Maya.  So beautifully done.,Thank you Blue Nose Audio and Ria Wilde for trusting me with this audiobook.,Thank you to Blue Nose Audio and Ria Wilde for trusting me with this audiobook.,,The way this book ripped my heart out at the 2% mark set the stage for an amazing, emotional journey. I was hooked from the start and there was never a moment that I wasn't fully invested in this story. Torin is what book boyfriend dreams are made of. He has taken the whole alpha possessive vibe to a whole new level because he has what it takes to back up that attitude. After Maya and her daughter show up on his boat he tries to ""grumpy"" his way into ignoring her but these two were destined from the start. ¬†Maya is such a strong FMC and is fighting to change her life and protect her daughter from the ghosts of her past. There was so much tension and angst throughout the entire book that I felt like I had been on an emotional roller coaster.,I read this book originally as an ebook when it first released but listening to the audiobook adds to the experience and brings this emotional story to a whole other level of angsty.,Troy Duran has the perfect voice to perform Torin and truly encompass his broodiness. The emotion and despair comes through in droves and you just feel the heartbreak, confusion, desire and care in every scene. Janine Granda‚Äôs voice is beautiful and so easy to listen to. She performs Maya‚Äôs character flawlessly and every small nuance is appreciated as she really delivers on the emotional performance. When she voices Harper my heart just swells for the little girl‚Äôs character.,,I cannot wait to continue this series. I love this town, love these characters and will be first in line to pick up Rett's story when it releases because I have a feeling these brothers are only going to get better. New Ria Wilde fan for life!!,This book by Ria Wilde already was amazing! But hearing them come to life was just everything! The Narrators did an amazing job bringing them to life! Definitely listen to this one!,I'm becoming a huge Ria Wilde fan. I loved this audiobook. The narration was so good. Troy Duran is amazing as always and this is my first narration by Janine Granda and definitely not the last. Action packed. Please check triggers. I can't wait to continue the series.,This is the first book in the Ravenpeak Bay Series,  a small town dark romance.  This is a series of interconnected standalones.  Torin and Maya's story is emotional,  and grippingly engaging.  The prologue is heartbreaking.  Maya, a single mom, is beautiful, smart, and caring.  She is a strong survivor.  Torin, a grumpy fisherman, is handsome, and enigmatic.  His story is heart-wrenching.  Maya's daughter Harper is so cute! The storyline is enthralling, filled with tragedy, angst, passion, and suspense.  Troy Duran and Janine Granda did an outstanding job bringing these characters, and this story to life.  They are perfect as Torin, Maya and Harper.  This is a great team author/narrators.  The audio production is perfect.  I highly recommend it.  Looking forward to listening to Like a Hurricane, the next book in the series.,This book is exactly why I love Ria Wilde. She knows how to capture my attention and keep me riveted for the entire story. This book is packed with suspense and passion, my two favorite things and this book could not be better. Maya has had enough of her abusive husband and makes her escape with her daughter as stowaways on a boat. Hoping to get away and not ever be found again, she has fear and hope working for her. Torin is a grumpy man, working through the guilt of his own past and dealing with life as it comes along. This woman is a true inconvenience to him. Until the chemistry between them explodes. Happiness is a wonderful thing until Maya's past comes to haunt her. Will Torin be able to keep her and her daughter safe? I was completely engrossed in this story all day, and didn't want to stop. It's exciting and the characters had me caring about the outcome. I loved every minute and I can't wait for the next book in the series!,,Tory Duran and Janina Granda are a great team. Both understand their characters and bring each emotion and each facet of their personalities alive. Duran plays the cranky Torin with ease, but quickly changes to the over protective alpha I love that he does. Granda comes in as Maya, scared yet brave and her passion comes through each scene. Loved these two and their narration."

Is that the writer is far too good at picking cliff hangers that make you want to immediately get the next in the series.,im really enjoying this series and Crimson is still the best also i get the feeling desdemona is going to be kinda annoying next book trying to show off and also the greatest news on the series so far is that Harley is going to leave the team and hopefully it happens on the next one,I have zero complaints. This is one of my favorite series. Could be the best ever by the end.

This one really puts Grimm and his Marines in a tight spot.,I never cease to be amazed by the accurate military details Haskell puts in his books. It‚Äôs a lot of what makes his stories so easy to get wrapped up in.,There‚Äôs a scene where Chief sends a newbie looking around the ship for water for the ‚Äúfusion plant‚Äù.

Unnatural Death,"Crime Thrillers,Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","I am nearly half-way thru the book and can‚Äôt take it anymore. This is not as good as previous Kay Scarpetta books; it drags on and on and is just plain boring.  I hate to say this as I‚Äôm usually a fan, but save your money.,I simply can't stand when they change narrators !!That have been a part of a series it totally throws the book off. I'm not saying this narrator is terrible but I didn't feel like I was reading a Patricia Cornwell book...:(,Literally 21 chapters of Lucy bragging and not following rules. Followed by 10 chapters of some action. Followed by two chapters of action. And then a build up for the next book. I‚Äôve read/listened to all of her books. This is definitely my least favorite. January Lavoy saves it: she‚Äôs always a good reader. Hoping for more next time.,Story is fine. Won‚Äôt stand the rest of time with the amount of current talking points thrown in with for no reason. Too many buzzwords that insert the author‚Äôs personal and political bias.,The story is soft and just not worth the over reach. The story line leans in too hard on the contrived.,I almost couldn't finish this. It started out ok but....the murder storyline was undeveloped, Kay was in mother mode and unable to set boundaries, and then they bring ****** back yet everyone goes on about their routines as normal? How did this get past an editor?,Too many cliches with lots of holes. She seemed to be playing the mother and not the smartest woman in the room. Lots of clues with predictable outcomes.,I liked her other books, so this was extra disappointing. Overall, it felt like a story that was rushed to publish. Way too much building up for a poorly developed storyline. Probably half the book was buildup that didn‚Äôt make a difference then a couple chapters of action, capped with too much of a closing.,It was ridiculous in every way. This series has disintegrated to the point where I‚Äôll never read another one of the books. Ever.,This one is definitely not one of her best. I‚Äôm a HUGE fan of this series and have read every book - multiple times. I even collect the signed first editions. But, this one fell flat. The whole book was a build up for the next book- which hopefully will make up for its 11 hour introduction. Read a summary and wait till 2025. Yes, there‚Äôs a big shocker. It gets a few pages. Very disappointed."

The Complete Dark Days Series,"Post-Apocalyptic,Teen & Young Adult",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I loved the story line and the premise ....   then was SO disappointed.  Had to give up.   I made it about 8 hours into the series.,PROS:   Great storyline, believable in how the EMP could occur and America could fall under control of another country.  Had some good action scenes and was progressing.    What went wrong?    The Cons began to outweigh the story line......,CONS:   MC sleeps with 3 women within a few days.  One of the ADULT females - not a teenager - actually say's ""I don't want to die a virgin"".  (Then she knew all kinds of sex moves... because she watched a lot of porn!)  I think my eyes rolled so far back in my head that gave myself an aneurysm.  THEN back at the bug out area they are supposed to fall back to, the women decide to go in to town just to kill a couple of guys that are perverts just to prevent them from doing any bad things after the EMP goes off.   Hmmm?  Felt like this was a stupid move... as they probably had ""friends"" that would come back to make them ""pay"".  Just stupid.,Note to Narrator:   Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.   I love you, man!  Did someone roofie you or slip this title in small print into your contract?!?  You still did a great job with the narrating as usual.  Just surprised you agreed to it.,Overall.....  had such great potential.  Just not for me.,wow I loved this. after finishing chapter 167 (yes, 167.) I felt like in a week of listening at work I went from who is this author, I hope this is good to thinking this was one of the best audio books I've ever bought. prophetic even sometimes.,and kevin pierce is always fantastic, I search for books by clicking his narrator tab and searching through his work. thanks kevin.,I wouldn't buy it again.  I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't buy it again.  I wouldn't buy it again.  I wouldn't buy it again.  I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't buy it again.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Did I say I wouldn't buy it again?,,Pretty good listen. Especially for the length you receive. Good characters and of course great narration by Kevin!,Story grabs you, embraces you, and takes you through the highs and lows.  Excellent narration made me feel part of the stories and kept me wanting to join in.,I enjoyed listening to this series.  Scary how close to realistic the scenario could be.,pre adolescent at best ............alpha bravo Charlie echo blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,Book 1- I‚Äôm not at all opposed to explicit content for appropriate audiences, and I‚Äôm not going to clutch my pearls at the mere suggestion of sexual activity. With that being said, the frequency of sexual encounters and the focus placed on them, along with the continuous sexual overtones, are completely unnecessary. There is a good story here that would serve as a much needed warning on what could happen, the existence we would be forced to endure, and how it might be combated. Unfortunately that story is constantly being interrupted with sexual encounters that read as though they were written by someone who has never actually had one. These sexual encounters aren‚Äôt necessary to move the story along or for character development. The conditions in which they unfold are also extremely unbelievable. Also- I understand that this is a work of fiction, but (without giving away details of the story), there are several other components to this story concerning some characters behavior and reactions to certain situations, that are so far from behavior and reactions that any normal human being would exhibit, that it makes it very difficult to take this book seriously. Or enjoy it.,I stopped listening at the ‚Äúbullet hole vagina‚Äù. This was supposed to be a great story according to other reviews. I didn‚Äôt know the apocalypse would make women so horny. The prequel book wasn‚Äôt bad, but the next is bad sex talk, a murder cult posing as homesteaders with unnecessary dick talk tossed in amongst movie military buzz phrases and a useless dog that farts. When Logan was shot and said he had a vagina and fingered his bullet hole was it. I couldn‚Äôt continue.,The narrator was good. I‚Äôve listen to him before. I have a better respect for his ability and professionalism to continue without laughing.,What really scares me is that this could really happen in the United States.  If we elect a president who admires dictators of other countries and takes away our ‚Äúrights‚Äù then anything can happen here.,This story is suppose to be fictitious, but think about all the hate and scorn that‚Äôs been unleashed in the recent past.,This story is unbelievable but not really. Sure gives readers and listeners a shock,of the ‚ÄúWhat if‚Äôs‚Äù.,Are you ready for the day a President of the USA sells our secrets to one of the dictators he/she admires?  Me neither.,Pray and vote for a President that truly believes in the Constitution and America.  Not for a guy who thinks only of himself. Regardless of party."

After you finish with this program, get the other audio programs from this author.,  I have all or most of them and they have helped my Spanish pronunciation and listening skills more than any other app I've tried.,In my quest for linguistic proficiency, this audiobook emerges as an innovative and efficient approach to language learning. As an avid traveler and enthusiast of the Spanish language, I found this audiobook not only convenient but remarkably effective. Its unique method of integrating language lessons into daily routines, both during restful and active hours, represents a significant advancement in language acquisition techniques. And the concept of learning a language during sleep, though seemingly unconventional, is grounded in scientific understanding. The audiobook capitalizes on the brain's heightened activity during the REM sleep phase, a period optimal for learning and memory consolidation. This passive learning approach, characterized by gentle, repetitive lessons, ensures a deep and lasting absorption of Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. The experience is akin to a subconscious immersion in the language, making it an ideal solution for those who find traditional learning methods too time-consuming or challenging. Furthermore, the versatility of the audiobook extends to active learning scenarios, such as driving or performing household tasks. The version without brown noise is meticulously designed to enhance focus and comprehension, allowing learners to seamlessly integrate Spanish lessons into their daily lives. This dual approach, combining both passive and active learning, creates a comprehensive learning environment, and adapts to various lifestyles and schedules. In summary, this audiobook is a groundbreaking resource for anyone seeking to master Spanish efficiently. Its dual-modality approach caters to the modern individual's busy lifestyle, making language learning accessible, enjoyable, and remarkably effective. As a language aficionado and frequent traveler to Spanish-speaking countries, I highly recommend this audiobook to anyone aspiring to achieve fluency in Spanish whether Latin American Spanish or European Spanish. It's a testament to the innovative possibilities of language learning in our contemporary world.,This course suits everyone‚Äîchill night owls and busy bees‚Äîwith its chill night learning and fun daytime sessions. Covering everything from simple words to fancy chats, it‚Äôs a full-on Spanish journey that fits right into your life. No more boring study routines; this course makes Spanish a chill, easy part of your day!"
The Engineer,,,"I love the series as a whole and Travis does amazing work as always. there are some complaints with some spoilers below, and u hope this is enough text to hide it from people scrolling,I do not like the constant distractions that prevent the crew from repairing the ship and then complaining that they'd love to go with this lead or that one but we can't cause ship broke. I am writing this with 4-ish hours left and hope this is solved soon because I'd rather see the crew work toward the impossible quests they have started rather than have the last horizon say yea let's go fight a war against everyone even though I can barely hold the ship together cause it's a story worth remembering... I hold faith in Will cause I enjoyed his other books but if there isn't at least some progress with repairing the ship by the next book I don't think I'll continue the series.,Very different to book one, but the part two we needed.,This story is exciting! Fun and it keeps you listening.,Great interaction between the crew. Pure space novella. Instant hit. Laughed out loud. Can't wait for the next one.,Book 2 never quite piqued my interest mainly due to the somewhat bland dynamics of the character mix. Some were two dimensional like Raion, whose power-of-positive-thinking was ever-present and who did offer moments of comedic relief, Shyrax a stereotypical haughty warrior queen and Mell a Mensa-like mundane tech nerd. While the others were OP they were more interesting, such as, like solo Sola, psychotic Omega, Starhammer, the antagonist Ajax-like tragic hero and Varic himself.,,The story pacing was brisk but somewhat repetitive at times and the MC tended to fall into exposition-mode too often.,,Travis Baldree performance was very good, of course.,,While Will Wight is one of my favorite authors, I'm unsure if I will continue to follow this series.,I might be over analyzing or comparing this with Cradle, but honestly, I hold Will as a better author than this. I wish there were more world building, more explanation of the many different magic systems involved, more character development, and in short, more story.,The Engineer could have been half as long as it currently is, or maybe 1/3 less and it wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything. Stormhammer was a decent BBEG, but it was repetitive, and his plot armor was strong. Mel had some development, but that‚Äôs all. We got some foreshadowing perhaps for Veric‚Äôs growth, but we‚Äôll see what happens.,I‚Äôd also like to see some of the story and plot carry on through the books besides just the crew. Sure, we‚Äôll see more as the books continue with certain items, but the sense of doom isn‚Äôt there like it was in Cradle or even Traveler‚Äôs Gate. I haven‚Äôt read The Elder Empire yet, so can‚Äôt comment there.,Good things: loved the humor. Many scenes made me smile. Glad the crew is starting to come together as a group, hope to see more of that. I also was glad to hear which iteration this is in. Curious as to the timeline with it and other events that happen in the wider universe.,I liked the first book and this one is just as good. the narrator does a great job as well.,I dont normally like action-driven books but boy oh boy I love this series so far. Just the right amount of details to the action scenes plus some feel-good characters in the mix. Love this!,Will Wight is becoming one of favorite authors! the story was great and combined with Travis Baldree performance, the characters come to life!  please kero it coming...,Just as good as the first book. You will not be disappointed with the story or the narration.,Great sequel, new characters to love and more of the ones I already like. This series is shaping up to have a much bigger universe that what I expected from The Captain.,My only complaint is that I wish they had another way of stopping the bad guys other than killing them. Our main characters are heroes they should be trying to save some of them too. Of course this is only the second book in the series and this is only my personal preference, the book is still fantastic."

Magic Bleeds (Dramatized Adaptation),Urban,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Fantastic performances which really brought the story to life! Can't wait for the next book,the voice actors really bring out some of the interactions that on just a normal reading you wouldn't see,Excellent casting for the characters.  The character voices are spot on. It is rare that I find audiobooks with the actors voicing the parts as they sound in my head or better, but every cast member for this hits the nail on the head.  The Innkeeper series by Ilona Andrews is the only other series I‚Äôve found so far where the voice casting is as good.  I cannot wait for the next book to become available!,These dramatized adaptions add an extra layer to one of my favorite series. I wish I had waited until more of the books had been released because I've officially caught up now.,I loved it all and disliked nothing! I read and listened to the original versions, but this is epic!,I am a longtime fan of Ilona Andrews books. These productions by GA bring the story to life in a really amazing way. Highly recommended!!,I love this entire series, but this particular book is one of the best I have had the privilege to listen to. The blend of action, romance, humour, and story telling come together in seamless perfection. and the full cast dramatization really brought it all to life. I know I will be listening to this book again in the future and I rarely do that.,‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt pick the family you‚Äôre born into, you pick the one you make.‚Äù,While the first three books set the scene (magic, tech shifting modern day earth with were-animals, vampire navigators, and godlike beings) and developed the main characters, this book busts open the full playing field, setting up the promise of several sprawling storylines for upcoming books.,,Among the wider developments is a true introduction to the seven were-clans and the politics of how they weave together, new and complex characters (Aunt Bea is a formidable alpha... gotta love strong women), powerful backstories for Curran and Kate, and, perhaps most importantly, focus of families new (Julie and Curran) and old (Kate‚Äôs blood relatives). I loved the mystery and villains in this book, and the magical slant on biblical tales. Era is a villain I loved to hate.,,Of course, my favorite component to Book 4 is the Kate-Curran merger. Finally! The fighting-flirting-fighting dynamic reached a fever pitch here, in hot and hilarious fashion. Loved it. And I love that the banter doesn‚Äôt fade after they get together.,,And Grendl. Let‚Äôs not forget Grendl.,,Plus, in this graphic audio format, the add-on Curren POVs at the end of the book are a great supplement to some of the pivotal events.,I like the Graphic Audio version of a book I have read multiple times.  I also really like the additional Curran POV at the end.  It is a great bonus to have it narrated.  I liked all the performances in this audio version.  I will listen again and hope they add the rest of the series.,Overall, I enjoyed this. I think it would have helped if the same pronunciations of characters names were used as in the original narrator. Renae Rodman is a difficult act to follow. I will definitely be checking out other dramatizations though.,Another great dramatized adaption of an old favourite. thank you for giving me the opportunity to enjoy it all over again in a new version!"

Highly recommend.,An invaluable resource for anyone seeking to break free from the insidious grip of toxic relationships and the emotional wounds they inflict. One of the book's greatest strengths is its detailed exploration of complex topics like narcissism, gaslighting, and codependency.

This knowledge is crucial for identifying and escaping toxic relationships, fostering self-compassion, and recognizing the abuser's accountability. I appreciated the tone the book used, and it was an eye-opening read.,,This book has been a lifesaver. The author is compassionate and knowledgeable about the topic. This book has helped me to better understand my relationship with my own narcissistic ex. I particularly liked the information in chapter two on how to financially uncouple your life with a narcissist. I could have used this during my divorce. I wish this information would have been available years ago.

Realizing you‚Äôve been there is the first step.,What an incredible, informative, and encouraging audiobook. I learned the signs of narcissistic abuse, gaslighting, and the true leaps & bounds someone must take to let go and heal from past trauma. Madison Bright, I can tell, put her heart and soul into this book. She is vulnerable with her audience, which isn't something one comes by often. I've learned so much regarding love-bombing, trauma bonds, and gaslighting codependency. I didn't realize someone can be ""addicted"" to gaslighting behavior, and now, I know through this audiobook how to not let it happen to myself. Also, Greer Gray's voice is so clear, and she articulates beautifully, which some audiobooks lack. This is a must-listen! I encourage all people healing from these forms of toxic relationships, emotional abuse, and trauma bonds to put their headphones on and give this book a listen. It will save you.,As someone who went through the painful journey of recovering from a toxic relationship, this audiobook has been nothing short of a lifeline. The gentle, understanding tone of the narrator made me feel seen and heard in a way that was both comforting and empowering. Not only it help me recognize the patterns of narcissistic abuse and codependency but also offered practical, step-by-step strategies for healing and reclaiming my sense of self.,,What I love is its empathetic approach.

It's not just about recovery, it's about rediscovering your strength and worth. It's a journey worth taking.,This book provides a useful overview of narcissism and tips for coping with abusive pasts. The first few chapters were excellent. The author shares her personal history with abusive narcissists, describes specific traits and characteristics for identifying narcissists and abusive relationships, and offers helpful suggestions for escaping those relationships. The remaining chapters felt more like basic coping to-do lists. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who thinks they may be in a relationship with a narcissist or other abuser and needs help working out their feelings and next steps, but I didn't feel it was an in-depth recovery guide."

When Gracie Met The Grump,"Fantasy,Superhero",Romance,"I love Mariana Zapata books so very much! She writes some of the best slow burns out there!! Thank you so much for have Callie Dalton on this, it‚Äôs not the same without her.,I love both of the narrators so much!!!! I would say the first half of the book was slow and the last half was amazing.,I liked the idea for this book. Unfortunately, any time the plot started to become exciting, it was ruined by the inane internal monologue of the main character. Wish it were better.,Mariana is definitely the queen of slow burn and banter. Alex and Gracie‚Äôs back and forths are gold. The narrators are amazing. Connor was the perfect voice for Alex.,Waited a very long time for the audiobook, MZ is always worth the wait. Callie and Connor were the perfect narrators.,The minute Mariana Zapata released Gracie and the Grump, I purchased it in print. I‚Äôve been waiting impatiently for the audiobook. Both narrators did a great job with the text. The only downside is having to wait for the next Zapata book. Absolutely worth the credit.,At first I thought what was Zapata thinking when she wrote this book but you get hooked and can‚Äôt stop listening to it.  I couldn‚Äôt put it down.  Again Zapata hit a home run with this book.  Can‚Äôt wait for the sequel to Alexander and Gracie.  This story line was bizarre with Alexander having powers and Gracie being so self sufficient until he comes along.  Loved the fact that she finds out she has special powers.  Would have loved more on their marriage.,Mariana Zapata is an automatic download for me in both Audible and Kindle store. My favorite all-time book by her was Kulti and have been a fan of her ever since. This book was delightful in that you had a grumpy superhero who cross paths with a mouthy, intelligent and spirited young woman on the run from the cartel. The banter between the two have you laughing one minute and admiring how their relationship solidifies the next .I highly recommend reading and listening to this story. It is well worth the time and laughter. I love how this author slowly builds relationships. It is a slow burn without too much of the extraneous sexual content , But the chemistry is there. The performance was stellar, and I loved Connor Crais performance of the Defender.,Why is everything she writes gold?! I laughed, I loved, I want to be the characters. Read it now!,Loved it from start to finish, the audio enhanced the book and brought out parts of the story I didn‚Äôt appreciate before. Callie Dalton is perfection and Connor Crais brought this grumpy hero to life!,If you‚Äôre a Mariana Zapata fan you‚Äôll love this, her signature slow burn style is on full display and I‚Äôm here for all of it!,,Another brilliant story and can‚Äôt wait for the next one. Really engaging characters, fabulous storyline, and giggles throughout.,,The queen of slow burns has won me over time and again, I bloody love this one.  The narrators were perfect- love that it's a duet,I love all of Marina Zapata‚Äôs books and I‚Äôm happy to say that I loved this one too.,It‚Äôs different to anything else I‚Äôve read from this author but at the same time her humour and manner of writing is so her! Me encanta!!,I‚Äôve read the book when it was first published and now bought the audio version and I love both experiences.,I highly recommend this book.,A very human story about a super hero that was very compelling with the usual slow-burn love story. I really wished there was an epilogue with more of a glimpse into the future for this couple, but that is a sign of a good book. One that leaves you wanting more.,Never thought I was a superhero kinda person but with a Mariana Zapata twist it turns out I am. I truly hope we get to meet others in the family and get to see snippets of these characters in those stories too.,This is a story a little different I feel than what Is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from Zapata but written in the same style as ‚ÄúThe Wall of Winnipeg‚Äù and others. I really enjoyed it and is just what I needed to listen to right now.,I have (not) so patiently waited for this book to drop on audio and it was everything I hoped it would be. I thoroughly enjoyed this, it was classic Mariana Zapata but also it wasn't, the story is so different to her others but it still had the most scrumptious slow burn I have come to expect and love from her writing. How she develops her characters and their relationship throughout her books just gets me every damn time. The narrators were perfect. This has become an instant favourite.,Nothing you expect but so much more! So recommended!!! Slow burn as mentioned by others.,Another thoroughly enjoyable slow-burn from Mariana Zapata. This was funny, sweet, great banter and just gave me all the feels. For an almost-20 hr listen, the worst thing for me is that it ended. Looking forward to listening to this again and more books from Mariana Zapata.,That was so entertaining and heartwarming. I am left with a huge smile on my face. THANK YOU Mariana and big thanks as well to Callie and Connor. I am a huge fan of all of you guys. I am going to listen to it all over again RIGHT NOWü•∞,I loved he chemistry between the two characters and the POV dialogue. I hate when you get a duet and it's only chapter for chapter. hearing them talk like in real life is perfect. another win for MZ,The performance by Callie was exceptional, but the storyline was not up to Mariana Zapata‚Äôs standards. The male lead in this book was extremely repetitive, the male narrator was out of place, and would have been slightly better if Callie just did both parts as it may have glossed over the repetitiveness of the male leads boringness and deadpan tone. Just save the credit/money and if you are really in need to listen to this Audiobook, maybe check out your local library on Libby to trial run it properly before committing to adding this book to your collection.,Such an unexpected story but enjoyed every minute of it. Now one of my favourite MZ books."

It is 7 stories plus a bonus story of different tales not all by Matthew.  All the main characters are given at least one problem to solve and solve they did.

And when a bride is left at the altar, he and Trace step in to help her escape. Fast forward, one year later, Sindey is back at the resort. She has been thinking about them for the last year and has felt an attraction to both of them. Trace and Elliott have always had a flirtation connection and when Sidney comes back, they all realize that there is an intense connection between the three of them.,Oh my gosh, there was so much emotion and passion within this story‚Ä¶ it made my heart so happy. Elliot had a tough time in the service like his brothers and had some struggles dealing with it. Finding Trace and Sidney helped him heal some old wounds that way he could be what they needed. Trace was such a genuine guy and I loved his role on the estate and how he felt connected with Elliot right away. I loved the longing glances and flirtation between them. Sidney was an instant favorite for me and I loved how she became apart of their lives. Being left at the altar was hard but it led her to better things. There were steamy scenes with all of three of them together and some with just two. That shows that this was a true polyamory relationship. The ending was so sweet and I can‚Äôt wait for the Wilder cousins stories.,Samantha Cook, Stephan Dexter and Ryan West were so great as this triad. All three were the perfect choices and brought each character alive perfectly. There were so many emotions and special moments in this story and I enjoyed this audiobook so much.,Sidney meets Elliot and Trace on the worst day of her life and within minutes they get her down to her underwear - not what you're thinking, but they are there when she has been betrayed in the worst way by the people she should be able to count on.,We all know that Trace and Elliot have chemistry that's off the charts, put Sidney into the mix and oh wow!,This book has to be my favourite. Why? Because Sidney is so relatable, Trace is not your usual guy and Elliot - a pure golden retriever and I love them all so much. They're real and true to themselves. Love that they could be themselves and s0d others - after all they're just having fun, aren't they?,I wanted to continually scream at her family that she did nothing wrong - but that's families for you, only believe what they want to believe.,The final Wilder Brother finds his happy ever after and I am so glad he does and with Trace and Sidney, they're perfect for each other and my heart is happy."

Same Time Next Year,"Holidays,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"Bailey packs a full romance arc‚Äîand her trademark heat‚Äîinto novella Same Time Next Year. Despite the short length, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was missing anything from Britta and Sumner‚Äôs story.,,In this marriage-of-convenience tale, Britta marries Canadian hockey player Sumner, so that he can stay in the United States and get his chance to move up in the hockey world. Britta doesn‚Äôt have fond feelings towards marriage, so she sets boundaries for them: they‚Äôll be friends only and there is an expiration date on their match. Sumner, well, he‚Äôs basically been in love with Britta since the moment he saw her, so he agrees to her terms. This is his chance to get to know her better and to further his hockey career.,,We know how these things go, though, don‚Äôt we? It‚Äôs tough to fight feelings and attraction. Maybe this marriage in name only will mean something more. Maybe there won‚Äôt be an expiration date after all.,,I enjoyed this one on audio. William LeRoy captures dirty-talking, kind-hearted, protective gentleman Sumner well, and Carmen Vine does an excellent job with independent, thoughtful, protective Britta.,I loved this so much!! The storyline and characters were so well written and very relatable. It is the kind of romance that makes you love ‚Äôlove‚Äô!,The narration was so so good!!!,Great romance story which was brought to life by both the  narrators. Author presented a good storyline that kept you engaged. Is about a Canadian hockey player who pays a girl to be his wife for a year so he can get a green card. Story does include a few very intimate, passionate scenes which were well written). Wish there was a sequel!,Cute little story, not a lot of character build up but still got me through a drive to work,Have always enjoyed Tessa Bailey‚Äôs books & I liked this one as well. It is predictable but cute. However, I did not care for the narrators. They didn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúfit‚Äù their character. The voices lacked inflection changes and always sounded the same. I wanted to hear the story but listening to it was hard.  So, I eventually turned to my digital book.,enjoy üòç every single minute. would recommend to any one again. one of my favorite books so far. would like more of this author.,4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è,2/5üå∂Ô∏è,4/5 üéß,This was a cute novella by Tessa. I liked the narration a lot, but some of the plot lines were unrealistic and hard for me to get into. I also didn‚Äôt like the major time jumps as I wanted to see more of their relationship together. I loved how obsessed Sumner was with Britta. I loved his character so much. It was overall a cute read, but I feel like Tessa has better books out there.,It was cute and perfect for getting to my reading goal this year. A little unrealistic immigration wise but still scratches the romance itch.,I loved this so much! I loved that he was a hockey player. I love hockey.  I also play hockey just loved that he was trying to get into the professional league. I really enjoyed this rom com.,A cute, sexy, hockey New Year's Eve contemp romance set amidst the semi pro hockey world with a fake  marriage; with dual narration,so far I have enjoyed every single book I've had from this author. But this one not so much. I enjoyed the drawn out anticipation but found the male narrator just too over the top, nearly cringey and I couldn't get past it. The overall storyline was good but felt rushed in places."

The Rougarou Rigmarole,"Cozy,Paranormal","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","I think I have posted before that the narrator for this book is good. Probably the best of all the Amanda Lee book series. Amanda mentioned that the Charlie books weren't great sellers. I can understand that somewhat, maybe if read and not listened to it would be a bit boring. I, however, have enjoyed getting to know the character through narration. I am glad to know that she will continue to pop up in other books/series.,I can‚Äôt wait the the next book in the series.  I can‚Äôt wait to see Charlie using her new magic.  Hope Jack is ready for the Grimlocks.,,Zoey Lake Winters is back in this book set in New Orleans.

Add in Zoe, who can help guide her more and they are a fearsome twosome, well until you add Harley and her mouth, loas, and the rest of the team. One of the best books yet and I can‚Äôt wait until the last book comes out.,I love Amanda M Lee's books. This was once again a homerun!

The manufacturer has to re-organize the audiobook, and then make sure the PDF file matches.  POSITIVE COMMENT:  The performance is fantastic.,What did you like best about Sherlock Holmes? What did you like least?,This is an amazing collection, but it was billed as being the complete works, and it is not.  This collection is missing an entire book of short stories.  Don't bill this as the complete works, if it is not.,Any additional comments?,I had purchased some time ago  "" The Complete Sherlock Holmes: The Heirloom Collection ""Narrated By Simon Vance a favorite actor since I discovered his narration of the Stieg Larsson Trilogy ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" being book 1. I enjoyed the Stories and narration and listened to the complete edition. It was wonderful. When I recently discovered a new ""S. Holmes"" audio book edition narrated by Stephen Fry whose work I admire greatly, I was tempted to purchase the stories all over again. I was also very much interested to hear Stephen Fry's commentaries on each of the wonderful stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It proved to be one of my better audio book decisions. I rediscovered Holmes and was swept away by this superb edition, narrated by an actor with a lifelong appreciation of the Holmes characters and work. Now you can have a visit at Baker St. and sit at Watson side. Thank you to Mr. Fry for this exceptional effort.  -  P.S. to Audible I would very much like to purchase Mr. Fry's reading of the entire Harry Potter series even though I own the Jim Dale version...with all due respect to Mr.Dale,Could there be a better bargain?  Nearly 63 hours of Sherlock Holmes read by Stephen Fry - this is an Arthur Conan Doyle fan's dream, and I, for one, could not resist!,My Audible library already contains the complete canon read by the great Derek Jacobi. My family owns the BBC DVD collection starring Jeremy Brett, and we are enthralled by the modern interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch and the TV series ""Elementary"".,So, Holmes is not new to me.  Yet the past few days have found me immersed in this new reading by Stephen Fry, and I have been with delight pulled into the tales of 221B Baker Street in Victorian England all over again.,Granted these classic stories can be dated.  The listener/reader sometimes cringes at the prejudices and stereotypes of the past.  Yet there's a reason this character goes on and on, bringing something to every generation and in each interpretation.,Fry's love for the material is clear.  He narrates with an actor's skill and a fan's enthusiasm.  The introductions add a welcome personal note, revealing what Arthur Conan Doyle's work has meant to the narrator. I still admire the Jacobi readings, but  Stephen Fry's performance, in my opinion, is even better!,If you, like me, are an old fan, then I don't think you'll regret investing in yet another visit with Sherlock Holmes guided by the wonderful talent and voice of Stephen Fry.  If, for whatever reason, you and/or your family have not read or heard the original tales, please consider experiencing them together - perhaps during car trips or before bedtime.  Hours and hours of good, old-fashioned storytelling - a credit could not be better spent.,Thank you, Stephen Fry!  Thank you Audible!,Love how this audiobook has named each chapter like in a regular book. No more guessing which chapters to pick just by number, now it‚Äôs clearly titled. It‚Äôs especially useful because of the length of this audiobook. Stephen Fry is an excellent narrator. I enjoy his informative introductions.,To be noted at the top. As several people have pointed out this is not actually a DEFINITIVE edition nor is it complete. It is missing at least 12 short stories collected as the Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, most likely because the provider of the content was unwilling to deal with the copyright issues still held up in the US. It also does not contain the semicannonical Lost Special.,If this does not bother you it is an excellent deal with lots of content excellently read by Stephen Fry with additional introductions by same.,Any audiobook that is a series of short stories should at the very least have the title of a story in the navigation. This is obviously Amazon's fault but it's a big one. If I want to find any particular story I have to go through each chapter and hope it's the right one.,The series of stories are of course fantastic and Stephen Fry does them justice.,Any additional comments?,The book was split into several parts for easier download, but it was spilt horribly. I ended up with a book that wasn't in order, i hoped it would be in chronological order, and more importantly parts of it were missing and I had the hounds of baskerville twice.  Once in part 3 the other in part 5.,Would you listen to Sherlock Holmes again? Why?,Great listening experience, but chapters not in orders and hard to sort it out... To the publisher: Please suggest the order as a remedy!,Would you consider the audio edition of Sherlock Holmes to be better than the print version?,Yes, but is because I am a huge Stephen Fry fan and so he just made the stories of Sherlock Holmes better. They are still great in print but audios are always great.,What was one of the most memorable moments of Sherlock Holmes?,That would be hard to pinpoint since it was 62 hours of Sherlock at once, but his arrogance always makes me chuckle.,If you made a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?,There are already many films of this character. It would be hard to come up with a tagline.,Any additional comments?,I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, read the stories, watched the movies and TV shows and this is just one more reading to put on my list. I l really loved the audio, though I had to take it in small spurts because it's 62 hours and that is a lot of listening.,I would recommend it to any Holmes fan because well...Stephen Fry!!!! ;)"

Trapdoor,"Psychological,Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","This book was really good. I love the twists and turns and the surprising ending.,Well constructed storyline. No gobbledygook. It is accurate to call this suspenseful. Very respectable talent in terms of the connection to human depravity, and its articulation with the good and bad in us all, and of how good can prevail as we learn from our mistakes. Superb narration.,I finished it in less than two days amazing storyline, gripping could not wait to find out how it ended the ending will Shock you.,This book was interesting that to appoint, but the ending just ruined it. It feels like all of this is standard build up of the plot was wasted because of the ending.,Crazy story of‚Ä¶ man I don‚Äôt want to ruin it, but‚Ä¶ revenge. And redemption, too. It was a wild, ugly whirlwind.,There were some very difficult parts to listen to, so much so I almost quit listening. It didn‚Äôt last long at each mentioning so I trudged through, but I‚Äôll end with some Trigger Warnings: child sexual abuse, human trafficking, sex addiction,I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The way it slowly panned out kept my mind spinning and I I didn‚Äôt see the ultimate twist until literally a second before the characters spoke it.,Definitely worth your while!,I loved this! Suspense was taut, narration was unobtrusive, and story was realistic.  The pacing was perfect.,A bit darker story than I normally would read, or listen to, however once I started listening, I couldn‚Äôt stop until I knew how it ended!,This book kept my interest from the first page to the last.  That's enough to give it 5 stars. Often times I listen to a book and get 1/2 way through and have no idea what's going on or the characters' names but not this book.  I don't want to spoil it for you but it wasn't the usual predictable happy ending.,It was pretty good until the end.  The ending made me wish I hadn't listened to it.,Well narrated, great storyline, and kept me listening. Lots of twists and turns. I love this author and this title is just as good as the others.,Good story. A couple of characters were superfluous to the story,  and the end dragged a bit, but a good yarn that keeps it interesting. Worth a listen.,Was weird, and confusing lol‚Ä¶but what a great story‚Ä¶ I downloaded as I have listen to a few Australian books recently and they have all been pretty dam good‚Ä¶,Great interesting story and very well read. So far every single Australian audio book I listened to was a good experience.,I‚Äôd recommend this book. Well thought out well paced storyline and great narration. I also think the author chose the best ending for the story leaving the reader both optimistic and positive and equally somewhat sad.,Don‚Äôt want to give away specific story details tho!,Very, very good, excellent performances and pretty emotional too. üò¢ üëè Gripping story, great characters,It wasn‚Äôt bad for a free listen but what started out as very good and had me hooked had me fasting it on at a higher speed to get through it from the middle to the end.,I liked the story line, and enjoyed the way the story unfolds throughout. Well narrated and kept me hooked all the way through. Even better that it‚Äôs included! Have downloaded the others!,Not at all what I expected. you'll need tissues but it's well worth it. the voice actors were perfection.,What a great story from a reliably wonderful author. Excellent performances as well. If you have time to indulge in one or two sittings, I highly recommend that!,Twists & turns.,Had me sitting at the end of the seat from the very start.,I'm a big JP fan but this is his best one yet I think. It really doesn't go where you think it will... goosebumps.,I really enjoyed this book and thought the actors did an excellent job. The twist at the end was well done and kept me quessing to the end.,Great thriller story with a twist right to the end. The male narrator was awful though - stilted and monotone. Women were good.,A dark and gripping story with lots of suspense and a couple of great twists.,Started listening with no expectations and was hooked from the beginning.,Story - check,Narrators - check,Well worth a listen for those who like crime with a side bar of suspense and thrills!,Love the twists throughout the story. Kept me on my toes. Had to keep reading to find out what was next,Lots of twists all the way through plus characters keep evolving, keeping the listener engaged.,Such a thrilling heartfelt thriller.

He Who Fights with Monsters: A LitRPG Adventure,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Urban,Litrpg System,Fantasy Adventure",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Took a flyer on a new title. This is one that I'm going to keep.,,I'm liking the the character development. We see (at least somewhat) believable characters who have moments of insensitivity, moments of apology, and who grow. We have a good-natured protagonist (23 years old, male, Australian) with lots of personality, perhaps fitting some Australian character tropes. I like the way that interactions between teammates are handled.,,I'm liking the worldbuilding. Our character has entered a new world. While I do read books with intense worldbuilding, this one has a deft touch. Cities and locations are described in an accessible level of detail, enough to picture the locations without being swamped with details.,,Although this is a LitRPG, we really and truly are not inundated with lists of stats. The character receives a new ability. It's named, and that's about it - up until we need to learn more about it. We see sections of his character sheet when they are relevant, we're not inundated with character sheet reviews. It's quite refreshing.,,I think the narration's truly great. It's a good performance, easy to listen to, with characters coming to life.,,This is well above average for the genre, a book full of personality. 4.5 to 5 stars.,,I don't know what exactly I can say that would do this book the credit its due. I will say that it's probably the very best LITRPG I've ever listened to, bar none. To put that into perspective, I have listened to at least 200 hours of varied LITRPG. I've enjoyed much of it.,,The things I love about this book are numerous. Let's start with the main character. Jason is relatable and down to earth. He's got a clever mind and a sharp tongue. The later gets him into vast amounts of trouble while the former just barely helps him manage it, if only by the skin of his teeth. His abilities are unique and quite powerful, but not to the degree that he can just waltz through every circumstance. His power is earned and his skills are gained through a combination of dumb luck, good advice, and a tireless work ethic to become more. Additionally, Jason has friends that are both on his level and above it.,,The characters, dialogue, humor, places, and plot arcs are all written incredibly well. In fact, the prose in the book is written so well, it's in a class of it's own in the LITRPG genre. I'm sure many of you are screaming at me ""What about The Land? That's some good stuff, right?"" Sure, ""The Land"" is good. This is better in most respects with the exception of 1 thing, which brings me to the only ""not the best ever"" thing I can say regarding this book: the LITRPG aspects are not very crunchy.,,I, for one, am fine with that. There's still loot, inventory, combat logs, health bars, abilities, etc, etc. The book is still LITRPG, but specifics are glossed over. This was done in such a way that I'm sure it was an intentional choice by the author. You see, Shirtaloon avoids numbers. There are no values for health, manage, stamina, or damage. While I do enjoy crunchy LITRPG, doing it right is pretty difficult as the pitfalls of overly verbose repetition, consistency, development trees, etc, etc are numerous. ""The Land"" is a prime example of a series that suffers from overly repeating itself. (I'm not trying to knock The Land, specifically. I'm merely using it as the basis of comparison regarding LITRPG as it's probably the most well known.),,I haven't listened to any books narrated by Heath Miller prior to this book. I almost didn't use the credit because of that. After listening to the preview and the rest of the book, I can say that Miller nails the narration with all the credit this book is due.,,If you like LITRPG, clever main characters, good dialogue, and a book that's just amazingly well written, spend the credit. You won't regret it.,,,There‚Äôs some parts in the book where Jason the main Character Goes on these rants about Political and religious beliefs It seems like it happens over and over again  he  just keeps bringing it up Which is just annoying another problem with the Story is it seems like every character comes in Contact with Jason becomes new version of Jason. starts off great,I really like the Magic system in place. But Want to say again those rants about political religious views it‚Äôs OK to have one or two of those in a Fantasy book I‚Äôm not reading or Listening to fantasy books for super deep Thought on power structures of the wealthy and the poor Also It‚Äôs a totally different scenario in this universe we don‚Äôt have super powers,This is the weakest and most inept MC I have ever seen. I get and appreciate the authors attempt to make his transition, into a new world and the pain of losing everything, more realistic. But, he went to far the other way. In addition the MCs personality is so annoying I couldn‚Äôt even listen to the book for more than an hour at a time before yelling at my Alexa to stop.  The MC handles every conversation with snark, which is funny in small doses, but after hours of the same dang thing over and over and over. I literally yelled out loud ‚Äúshut up‚Äù.,In addition the MC is made to be a side kick, is always a side kick and seems to be lacking anything that makes me want to connect with him. I like almost every other character in the book more than him.,In conclusion this story, world etc has potential but it‚Äôs all ruined by the MC,The book starts off pretty strong, but it becomes clear pretty quickly that the book really needed an editor. There are a number of things that are described nearly verbatim multiple times, and the middle of the story seems to have no real direction. On top of that Jason, the main character, is described as a very ordinary guy and for the first part of the book is written that way, but later in the book he becomes a master of social manipulation as well as a moral philosophy professor. Not only does this feel out of place, his preachiness is kind of frustrating. I would warn religious people that the main character is militantly atheist and, although he overcomes that a bit in terms of the in universe gods, he is incredibly rude about really world religion. Overall, I found myself disappointed because the book had a lot of potential, but ends up being  an aimless series of stories about a character who seems wildly inconsistent until the end. 2.5/5,This book could have been so great if the author didn't feel the need to force in their personal views on Atheism, ""Privilege"", social standing, etc. Really didn't add much value, and I found myself multitasking through these parts to get to the action/development parts of the book which the author did do well.,,,,,This book is a great start to what maybe a topshelf litrpg book. I loved the pacing and character development. I also love that it's long and tells a great story without needing 3 books to do that. One of the things I think is a problem with most litrpgs is that they are like dime novels and are short needing multiple books to finish a story ark. That is not the case for this book if you are a fan of ""The Land"", ""Edens Gate"", of ""Bushido online"", than this book is a great read.,6 hours in and nothing is going on. They spent like 2 hours on nothing but debate on essence which could‚Äôve been done in maybe half an hour,,The narrator was good and I think the story has some high points. I enjoyed a lot of the banter and thought a lot of the snark delivered by the Mc was clever and entertaining.,In other reviews I have seen the mc referred to as dumb but I think that's inaccurate. He seems more immature than anything. He spouts rudimentary arguments about atheism for about a 1/4 of the book and acts petulant towards any high class people he meets regardless of whether they deserve it. He actively degrades religion in front of normal everyday citizens unprovoked. I am an atheist, I see this as incredibly immature. I do not see how this is different from traveling to a different country and condescending to the people there just because you don't think their beliefs are correct.,He stereotypes people constantly and begins conversations with strangers by throwing an insult. I didn't hate the book and even found parts of it quite charming but I needed to pause it every hour or so to let the arrogance waft out of my bedroom.,,MC is an insufferable prick. I don't want to waste any more time on this review.,Alright, not much of a reviewer but come on this was just amazing.,,If your reading this to see if the book is worth listening to, I'll make it simple, the stories is as fun as its complex, the narration is diverse as well as top notch, and the characters are 4 dimensional. Also if your looking for something that not only latches onto your attention like a leach but also lasts for a ridiculous long time...,,Haveing said this, I can still think of one problem-,,THE FACT THAT AM GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK,To give a little background: He Who Fights With Monsters is an ongoing webnovel (or series... I'm not sure of the correct term), and this is the first 113 chapters of that novel.,Heath Miller does an excellent job of narration, including the readings of the various abilities and other pop-ups the main character, Jason Asano, gets during his adventures in a new world. If I had one, minor complaint, it's that sometimes these pop-ups create run-on segments that are hard to listen to; they work better in a visual format.,For the story itself - your mileage may vary, but for me it's an engaging exploration of a new world with  magic and monsters. Itsmain flaw comes from its roots as a webnovel - several times, a concept or event covered in one chapter will be re-explained in a later chapter, sometimes even in the next chapter. As long as you can put up with that happening from time to time, it's a fun listen :D,I don't know if the source material had the ""said"" part after each line of dialog, but it's grating on my nerves, and I couldn't get past the second hour of the book.,Also the book is a lot more gory than others in the genre and so far the mechanics of the powers is a bit confusing.,The narrator was doing a fine job, impersonating different people so the ""said"",""asked"",etc. parts could have been greatly reduced.,While not strictly the best book or plot in the world, it had me laughing out loud and smiling constantly. The main character is someone I would genuinely like to meet at buy a drink. Most litrpg tends to be shameless power fantasies often surrounding objectively terrible people, however Jason is not so much a white screen to project the readers wish fulfilment on to but instead comes across as a genuine person in his own right who I personally would like to have a beer with.,Long ; which I always like ; and entertaining . A great take on the genre .,Great voice acting by mr Heath in combination with an amazing writing combined into one of the greatest audiobooks i had the pleasure to experience.,This is one of the best Litrpg's I have read and I have read a lot. An interesting world with interesting characters. The author could probs have got away with splitting the book into 3 parts but I am really glad they did not as being so long really helped immerse me.,,I really enjoy having a smart MC that not only adapts to the world fairly quickly but is also socially and politically adept. MC getting on his high horse felt like the book was being a bit heavy handed with its moral point of view at first but over time it felt more like it was a character flaw than an issue with the writing.,,My only real complaint and it is a petty one is the silly incantations the MC uses, they really pull me out of the book for some reason and while over people might have used them in the book I dont remember anyone else doing so which makes it more jarring.,,Can't wait for the next one!,I rarely leave reviews, this book earns one.,After reading or listening to likely a few thousand books throughout my life, I almost always become irritated with the main character's stupidity and/or naivety. This book is different, the main character has a couple of brain cells to rub together, and he's brilliantly quirky.,There are a few minor issues with the book, one phrase about gold rank portals is repeated, and I would have preferred to have less character name insertions in dialogue. However this is greatly over-shadowed by excellent narration and a totally addictive story.,I want more! :),Amy laugh out loud moments, good fun story and I was totally left wanting more.,,Roll on May!,Nice story very engaging with a lot of potential to be a big series =),Without going into too much detail, I'll preface this review by saying I started reading HWFWM around 6 months ago, when it was still on Royal Road. I don't read web novels as a rule, but I'd seen it suggested too often to ignore it, and the plot breakdown of ""an Australian goes to a magical world and resorts to the age-old Australian survival tactic of making as many friends as possible"" promised, if nothing more, a funny story. I won‚Äôt deny that being from Australia myself influenced that decision, because supporting local talent is important etc.,,Anyway, I got more than I expected, and, reading through the first thirty chapters, I realised that this writer was on his way to being published in a more traditional format. I hoped it would happen, but was surprised all the same when it happened (for me) so quickly, and with an audiobook release, too. So, of course, I finally got around to starting my Audible subscription, and made this my first purchase.,,HWFWM Book 1 is an entertaining start to the story of Jason Asano, covering the first major arch of the story. I really liked  it, even on a second reading, and the story wraps up the best it could. This, I think, is the book's only stumbling block. The format of web novels is such that marking an end to an arch can be dificult, and this first book wraps up after a major turning point in the plot, however, it leaves two major plot points in flux. Unavoidable as this is, it may rub some readers the wrong way. Still, it wont be a problem, if the second book gets released. There IS a very easy place to leave that book, which wraps up the current main plot. Still, I would reccomend this book to any who find the blurb interesting. It is well worth it, in my opinion.,,Also, of note, I rather liked the narration of the book. I was expecting a fake Australian accent, or none at all, but I was pleasantly surprised to receive Heath Miller's voice, instead.,,slow start where I nearly dropped the book. but ended up being well worth the listen got my ore order for the next one,This book is fun and interesting with a great MC and cast although the MC is a little to smart for me.,The book kept me want more the hole way through and I can‚Äôt wait for the next book. The voices are nice with a gray range between characters.,I also love the True Blue Slang .,Overall 15/15.,,I loved the concept and enjoyed the book, but I did find it quite annoying that the ranking system of iron < brass < silver < gold was contrary to what most RPG'ers would be used to.,,Copper & tin< brass< iron < silver < gold would be more familiar.  Not a big deal but it did spoil the fantasy a little (at least for me).,,all I can say is Jason, the main character, acts like nobody I've ever encountered in life. I was rolling my eyes from the vet beginning.,maybe the overall story works out well, but I couldn't finish. I can't believe this got rated as one of the best audiobooks of the year.,this is not a story, it is a rendition of a terrible computer game.  I would find the story lacking if I played the game, but to have it read out is painful,I'm so sorry for myself that I have wasted 1 credit on choosing this title. Very juvenile storyline, no character development, no background, I couldn't get through more than  few chapters.,MC is one of the best I've listened to in a long time, the story is rationale thought out and believable at least concerning relationships, choices and politics. Highly recommended,This is literally like listening to someone play a video game. Down to the listing of items in his backpack. Genuinely I‚Äôm not sure it can objectively be considered a book!,The first few chapters were a bit difficult to listen to. Hearing Jason describe his HUD in detail wasn't thrilling but once through that I was blown away.,There was some great world building! It felt very dungeons and dragons inspired and I loved it!"
Galaxy's Most Wanted,Space Opera,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I love it. This is was a blast! It's fun and funny and has a lot of great, original ideas. I loved Landon! What a phenomenal character.

Light Bringer,"Adventure,Dystopian",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This book fixed the worst aspect of the last 2, the terrible ensemble voice cast.,Great story, great reading!,I expected a varied cast of voice actors, like the last two books. Instead, I got one voice actor who doesn't sound the same as his previous works. I appreciate TGR, and it hurts me to leave a negative review, but the quality of this production is so far removed from what I came to expect from this series.,I hope this gets properly addressed, because I want so badly to leave a good review. As of now, I cannot do that in good conscience.,God i love this series and this book was absolutely amazing but it kills me a little inside at the same time. I swear i lost 5 years off my life due to gut wrenching anxiety this whole book waiting for the shoe to drop. I knew it would come but still wasnt ready for it.... No spoilers its just hard not to rant. I guess thats what reddits for.... Anyway,  this installment of the series was very well executed. I see alot of comments already complaining about TGR taking over the whole production instead of having different voice actors for each POV like the last 2 books. Im actually in agreement with that opinion but to a lesser extent. I loved mustang and lysanders narrators (not a fan of lyrias) in the previous book and would've loved it if they came back but the thing is i seen plenty of comments complaining about all the different narrators on both of those books so i guess PB figures he cant please everyone so hed go with the cheaper option and i dont blame him. I feel like i was the only one who applauded the choice of multiple actors. If you enjoy something about a production let it be reflected in your ratings and comments so the creators will know whats popular. Not just when you DONT like something or else  only the negative voices will be heard. Anyway i feel if the whole show had to be laid at anyones feet im glad it was TGR cus he is a marvel. As for the actual content of the book, it was beautifully written, consistent with his previous works but with alot more sentimentality, warmth and light than the previous books which i was really greatful for. Pierce Brown is so gifted at pulling emotional strings im glad he spent so much time on matters of the heart and relationships in this book. It was touching and moved me. But like i mentioned above i drove myself insane with worry the whole way through because i knew peace can never last in his works... their just too gd believable and puts humanity and all its flaws under a microscope for all of us to bare witness to. The evil of man but also the light and strength and power of hope and will. Amazing book. Enjoyed it and will be crying in a corner for a while... maybe its a good thing theres years between each book release. Gives us time to recover.... I also wanted to mention how greatful i am that PB recognized he couldnt give us a satisfactory ending in the limited space of one book so instead of just saying screw it and writing something sloppy and unsatisfying (like some authors i know) he adapted and is giving us another book in order to have the proper amount of time to finish things properly.,Hail Reaper,Never has a narrative invoked such tremendous irrefutable emotion from me. I am in awe of Pierce Brown. Enthralled. And now that I close this book, I must return to the real world with the incredible weight of it on my heart. What a treat & what a burden.,As always, much applause for TGR as he is able to convey such intricate dialogue with heartfelt emotion- or purposeful lack there of. To the characters, the prose, the story telling, & the voice actor- Applause. Applause!!,Ad Astra,First this book is just great, any RR fan will love it in my opinion, its a bigger page turner than dark age.,Second a lot of reviews are pooping on TGR narration or complaining about the audio quality, i think his narration is great but i understand they got use to lysander's VA from IG/DA. There are some lines he did that brought me to tears with his performance is all ill say from the quality of the VA, the only complaint is his Lysander is basically darrow which is tough since he wasnt doing the va for him in the last two books.,Lastly, im 2/3 through the book and had to write this review because i saw all the negative reviews, this book is great so far and i can't image it having a bad ending. My two cents, TGR and PB are gods of their craft and can't wait for the last book.,Where the hell are the voice actors!??  I waited 2 years for this!  So incredibly disappointing!  What a complete waste.  This could have been an amazing audible series.  The voice actors MADE this what it was.  This is an embarrassment.  It takes you out of the story completely..   I was disappointed when Lysander was replaced in IRON GOLD, but now you replace them all??  Having different VAs, playing different parts, emphasized the different views and feelings from different characters, through different inflection and cadence..   Now i have some dude narating Virginia and Lyria.  If i wanted to have a monotone man narrating, i would have just read it.,I‚Äôm still early into listening so I‚Äôm not saying the story is bad BUT!! The first couple of chapters, Darrow sounds like Darrow. But then Lysander sounds like Darrow. THEN Darrow sounds unfamiliar. Pretty disappointed.,The story is excellent. Brown has hit his stride by now, and his writing is top notch.,The recording is a problem for me. TGR is an amazing reader. We have heard it in the previous books. This one sounded off though. Like he was an AM talk host speaking into a tin can. This likely falls on the studio and their mixing.,In addition, the previous two books used different readers for different perspectives. Moving away from this was a mistake. Specifically when the story is transferring between Darrow and Lysander, it is hard to distinguish who you are following.,#re-record After the brilliance of iron gold and dark age for them to just go with one voice actor is very disappointing. It feels like when a show knows it‚Äôs going to make its money so it no longer cares about the product. I love Tim Gerard Reynolds. But I was connected to the characters that you created. I wanted to spend time with them again I waited years for this book, and it is a supreme disappointment. But only for this reason, the story as usual is good. I just hope this isn‚Äôt a sign of the series going the way of Game of Thrones where they thought their audience was just built in and wouldn‚Äôt leave no matter what they throughout.,Please bring back multiple voice actors! using the same one for Darrow and Lysander is very off putting especially because the other two books use different voice actors.,I'm still reading so no comment on the book itself and provisional 4 stars. But I had to highlight the fact performance is a major step back. Overall quality of the recording is poor and seems to have lots of noise, which appears to get better in later chapters. While Tim is amazing as Darrow (love you Tim), the return to a single narrator is a terrible choice considering the multiple points of view and makes things far more confusing, especially with Lys and Darrow sounding almost the same while also having lots of interwoven chapters. Especially since all the actors from Iron Gold were absolutely perfect in their roles, so it was deeply disappointing to make such a huge step back.,not finished but feel compelled to comment since I saw the ridiculous comment by another listener.,tim is the best in the business, I have listened to 300 + audio books, mostly fantasy + sci-fi and he is pure class.,I am well into the book and find his characterisation much more subtle than the previous books. in particular lyria + Lysander who were jarring and lacked depth in previous manifestations.,after watching the red rising loose it's original magic after the first 3 books, I was expecting to be disappointed tbh. i am glad to report pierce has got his mojo back, book 6 has let's just say brought together the characters that we know and love again.,I still can't say it's the best in the series but it's very enjoyable so far, a large part being tim's incredible skill but I feel pierce has recovered the confidence of the original series.,,Can‚Äôt wait for the next one. I wish it had more Virginia POVs. Sevro still a beast,Love it all this does not miss a beat, bring out red god asap please,,Even with all the hype, he delivered. Superb book with all the breathless action, plot twists,  and character building that we‚Äôve come to love from Brown, chapeau.,Love having TGR back to do the narration. Loved LB and it‚Äôs my new favourite in the saga.,no words its amaculate and tim is a nice touch to have back on the book multiple different readers arent fun,,TGR narrated it superbly. Heartbreak, glee, twists and turn await. A good listen and a good entry in the series,Having one narrator for all POVs was a fantastic decision, it brings the whole story back to Darrow. The best book in the series‚Ä¶so far!,I have loved this series. Dark age was the only book i felt was distasteful. The voice actors from that book left my mind scared but now Tims back in charge its back to the top. Dark age was a little sickening i felt it went way too far away from the other books.,My only ask is you bed Tim to redo dark age with only his voice.,Lightbringer was brilliant unexpected direction of the story. Characters back to their best.,Please do not make us wait long again for Red God. 2019 to 2023 is an unacceptable wait for a story.,,Evil Darrow Vs Sovereign Darrow for Mars while Darrow has a thing fixed in her head and Darrow returns from being lost in space following mercury. Struggling to read. poor audio quality, rushed production with a single author. The reduced scope of the audiobook is a let down.,A roller-coaster. I can‚Äôt wait to read again. I miss the multiple narrators of the last 2 books but TGR does a fantastic job as usual. The audio quality seemed a bit funny but I was used to it after a while. Already beginning my re-read.,It‚Äôs a big call. But I think this series might be my favourite sci-fi ever. It has all my favourite parts of the hunger games, game of thrones, and the expanse all rolled into one. I‚Äôm so into the audiobook that sometimes I have to pull my car over to just yell into the void about what is happening. I love this so much and cannot wait for Red God.,Highest highs, and lowest lows. It‚Äôs a roller coaster. Tim is brilliant, but I missed the other narrators.,loved it my favourite of the new trilogy and Pierce has really grown as a writer,**SPOILERS**,I really thought it was going to wrap up in this one but it was more plans going wrong and everyone unhappy it got a bit draining and I had to take a break for a while half way through. But as always the narrator does an amazing job,Every book in the series I read breaks me a little inside. Brown is ruthless with his characters but in a way that draws out all of your emotions. This has been the highlight of this second series for me. Beautifully written, exciting and heartbreaking.,It is wonderful to get to see the antagonists view and see his fall into darkness.,Can‚Äôt wait to read book 4,After a slow & confusing start in Lysander's chapters in particular (having not listened to the last book for a few years), this book takes off for an epic space opera of the best kind. It's got philosophy, violence, back stabbing, intrigue, and sci fi in spades. A must listen!,One of the better books in the series. Took a few chapters to get into the flow but it kicked into gear real quick. Can‚Äôt wait for the final book!,The story is amazing, TGR is a great performer but the audio quality is appalling."
The Case of the Felonious Faire,,,"I really love this comical reimagining (or more of a reinventing) of a sherlock-esque character.  Its not another series trying to be john watson telling storys of the true Holme's or another writer claiming all of watsons writings were false and their telling what REALLY happened. Ive found a couple authors that did the name of sherlock holmes justice with their tales but as a big fan of the original works by sir ACD when authors try and completely retell the story of watson and holmes in a completely new way it feels cheap to me. Its like the authors want to write a certain type of story but use and abuse the famous names of watson and holmes to get people to read without staying true to what made the characters great in the first place.,THIS book however is nothing like that at all. Its a completely unique story all its own about a man being unwillingly dosed with a drug that basically makes him a sherlock level genius without the ability to focus that intellect say for a 5 minute window once a day. That idea in and of itself is a stoke of genius (much like all Drew Hayes works) but the characters are also very well developed and deep not to mention have alot in common with the original duo (in a vague distant type of way, seperated by over a century).  Written masterfully like I've come to expect of Hayes by this point. I honestly dont know how he crafts such entertaining, funny, touching works of art so consistently but he does (and i hope he never stops). Without fail he always knocks it out of the park.,This story takes place in a Renaissance fair where Sherman and Watson are trying to find the culprit of some financial fudgery. The actual mystery aspect of this story in particular wasnt all too intricate, but the real fun of these books lies with the characters and the hijinx they get up to (and there was PLENTY of that to go around). I am sad these books are so short but the type of story it is, its to be expected. I wouldnt really appreciate it being dragged out for the sake of length so overall im extremely pleased with this book and the series as a whole. Seems to be hes setting up for the mysterious character that was hinted at in the last book to make an appearance soon so that should be interesting ü§î,Shout out to Scott Aiello for doin a superb job with the narration. Really helps me get lost in the story.,Cant wait for Hayes next fictional perfection!,,It‚Äôs a fun story with some humor. It continues the series well and sets up the next installment.,Amusing as the others in the series and an easy listen! I look forward to the next one.,Feeling hints of super powereds. Which is one of my favorite series out there. The trickery task is so similar to Nick and his like in the other books. I‚Äôm liking that. This story is becoming one of my favorites. Drew is such a master story teller he could tell stories about a paper clip and the papers it holds together and if would be interesting,I continue to enjoy the series.  the characters continue to develop and be enjoyable.  The big story arch confines to develop.,Another fun book from Drew Hayes. I look forward to more 5 minute Sherlock books.,These books go by way too fast for me.  Fun and highly entertaining. Perfect narrator.  I wish they were longer or at least new installments published quicker. If I have any complaints, it‚Äôs the deeper plot is only progressed a tiny bit at the very end.  Hopefully, in the future, a whole book will be devoted to that mystery.,In this third installment of the adventures of Sherman Holmes and his intrepid assistant, Watson, we have another story that is fun, fanciful, and fervent in its dedication to making the absurd a part of everyday life. In this book we see the further development of Watson, get a look into what shaped him to be the man he is today, and see the growing relationship between the World's Greatest Wizard and his trusty Knight Errant. I always look forward to the next Drew Hayes book because I know I am going to get to know his characters even better with each chapter. He doesn't disappoint with this offering.,Scott Aiello again does a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. I am so glad he has become a member of the Drew Hayes stable of incredible narrators.,If you've listened to books 1 and 2 of this series, you won't regret the third installment. It satisfies the inner ren-fair geek in all of us. Now I'm off to go find a turkey leg as big as my forearm! Huzzah!,another fantastic installment. I couldn't stop listening and nice to hear more of Watson's past,A good follow up that builds on the world we have come to love. But there's plenty of character growth wrapped up in a well paced and fun plot."
Brokedown Prophets,,,"This by far one of the best things I‚Äôve listened to all year. Thanks to everyone who was involved in this.,SA Cosby is simply brilliant  - what a tremendous talent this man is.  He can tell a story like no one else, and the characters  he creates become real.  Brilliant story with exceptional narration.  I don't usually care for sound effects, but I have to say that the sound effects really added to the production.  Fantastic in every way!,The only thing I disliked was how frustrating Digit's behind was!! Haha! Which is actually a testament to how well everyone performed. Bravo! And Johnathan Majors, WONDERFUL!! I could listen to him monolog all day. Keep the stories coming, SBH Productions!,quite frankly I was unsure of this book,  but maaaaan.... I loved it. great arch, characters , dialog etc. great audible performance. gonna check out more from this author at some point. I wish this one kept going. that being said, I love the ending as well.,When I embarked on this journey through this audiobook I didn‚Äôt really have expectations. The actors that are reading are stellar and I am a huge fan of Charlamagne The God and heard him promote it so i figured I would give it a chance. This book is tremendous. It‚Äôs a thrill ride and the story takes you through so many emotions and the descriptions make you feel like you‚Äôre in the diner or the room or anywhere they stopped. Preacher always giving deeper meanings of each situation is a true standout as well. This was fun. I highly recommend.,I forgot that S A Cosby mentioned this was a full cast and actual production with sounds and all. This was so entertaining and I was glued to see what would happen next. It was like listening to a movie or watching a TV show. I love how under the surface of the crime/thriller aspect of his books there are other human elements such as love, friendship, forgiveness, family, sin, redemption, and not to mention humorous dialogues. I am a die hard fan and reading anything the Pen Whisperer writes.,when it comes to SA Crosby I'm all in! this story is no different! I rarely listen to credits but with this one, I definitely did! teaming up with Kevin Hart and Chalamagne was MAGICAL!,Great story. I loved the cast. They made the story come to life. Well worth the listen!,It was way better than their first one and had me laughing out loud and cursing anyone who interrupted my listening!,Being that I've been a fan of S. A. Cosby's work for quite a while now, when I saw this new audio book available from Audible, I jumped on it. If you are a fan of crime novels by the likes of Dennis Lehane or Joe R. Lansdale, this is definitely the audio for you.,,With a full cast of narrators, music and sound effects, it is clear that a lot of time and energy was taken to make this audio the very best it could be. With S. A. Cosby's remarkable wit and amazing ability to get the reader/listener involved in the character's lives, you couldn't ask for a better 4 hours of listening pleasure. DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!,Liked the comedy in it.,LÔøºÔøºiked the concept of the story & the backstory of the characters.,Didn‚Äôt think the Russian assassins were believable in any way. Not even close.,Main characters just weren‚Äôt likeable. Not sure why, but only Maria felt realistic.,The farm battle was as weak as it gets.,Giving the 1/2 the money away was the icing on a nasty cake. Just wouldn‚Äôt happen.,Listening to actors was interesting, but ruined some scenes, due to chaos/noise.,The credits were like a whole chapter! When you need this many actors, it‚Äôll take 10x longer to produce a book & will just bump the price upüò©,On the whole, it wasn‚Äôt easy to chew through. Give me narrated books, not a hybrid ‚Äúshow‚Äù."

Moral Stand,"Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Another great book in the series by the author. The only bad thing about this book is the amount of time I‚Äôll have to wait till the next volume comes up.,As always, Andrea did a great job voicing all those voices she truly brings meaning and feeling into each characters, unique voice and personality. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one Daniel. Hope you‚Äôre working hard.,Once again great Narration. This book is a good setup for future books. I wish that more of the other characters were included but I believe the author has chosen to make the main character the one who has to make the difficult choices. Make you the judge of his actions alone.,This book is good it's just missing all the girls. Can't wait till the next book when they all get together again. It better not take to long till they all meet up in Croga Kraga whatever it's called.,andrea parsneau is amazing as always with narration. the saving grace for this book is that we dont have constant interaction with the squeaky harem. not much hope for the next book.,Loved how the story progressed. Really hoping that Darkness is revealed in the next book or two so she can be part of the group.,This book was so well written, the narration is outstanding love the bloopers great plot development great character development, great series development,I am so excited for the next book. I find myself in able of waiting for the audiobooks to drop so invariably I end up reading the ebook as soon as it comes out and then doubling back for the audio when that drops. the lady narrator has delivered yet another fantastic performance. I do occasionally find myself enjoying the bloop of real. it is unfortunate sometimes to have the blue for real start playing immediately following a meaningful end but such is life. this entry into the series covers to add a year and a fight against the evil slavers. I can't wait for the next one and I believe at the time of this review we are looking at 3 months before the next entry sometime February 2024. fingers crossed and I'd be elated to see it show up sooner. with that I will simply say Well done to everybody who's had a hand in bringing the story to us the Amazon readers and audiobook listeners.,Story and background for this whole series is awesome. The Harem is getting little too big‚Ä¶ takes away from the original characters in my opinion. But the overall story and where it‚Äôs heading is awesome.,the book is awesome can't wait for the next hurry plz and the the last chapter...lol was funny,Still enjoying the story and narrator after 7 books. The Princess Bride joke in the bloopers is almost exactly the same thing I thought of during the scene. This might have my favorite blooper reel yet.,slow and not as good as 1-6 books but they can't all be great,The world in this series just keeps expanding. It was good to see Gregory staying to his morals. The combat is fast paced and brutal, there's comedy and other slice of life elements which all combine to make this a great book,well I enjoyed this one a lot just keeps me wanting more this series is one of my favourites. cannot wait for the next book,Next book please, don't take a full year, üòò will give the story teller 10/10 love the bloopers,not much that's needed to say this deep in the series...,it's all that you want,i like schinhofen when his stories have less saccharine and cheesy dialogue with the MC and his wives/potentially wives, honestly i feel 2 or 3 are completely unnecessary but atleast we get deeper insight in their resonances and they are not shown sept for the dreams.,this book is all greg and his gaurds tackling their obstacles and the plot, we see how he deals with being away from his wives, his character and development of his loyal gaurds, i hope the later books tone down on his lovey dovey stuff or atleast drop the pet names.,Andrea Parsneau will always be one of the best Narrators.,overrall i good solid  entry and cant wait for the next.,It is slow compared to the earlier books true, but it maintains the good standard."

Puts energy into the reading. It almost sounds like the books default speech speed was reduced after the reader completed recording.,,Great read! Definitely more of an intellectual read. If you were expecting something like the other books, it‚Äôs not. Less entertaining, more deep thinking. Will definitely have to read it a couple of times to grasp all the material. Starts of a little slow (in my opinion) then for me picked up at the end! Lots on envy, group behaviour, past traumas, social norms, our mortality and death. Reader is fine, just no music in the background like other books. Thank you for all the hard work and effort you put into it!,I cannot say that I've finished a lot of books during my not so far impressive 24 years on this planet. I used to do everything else but consuming(I use this word to combine reading and listening) books until recently I discovered Audible. I always knew about audiobooks but never really encountered a service of such convenience, quality and variety. And most likely I thought that spending money on books is a waste. Anyway, back to this particular book.,,I honestly believe that this book will fit every single human on this planet. It spreads awareness about kind of things everyone knows about but perhaps never really thought through. It digs up your subconscious and makes you aware of it. It shows that you are good, by nature, but still struggling to find this good in the world. The main lesson of the book, at least for me, is that if you want to see changes start with changing yourself. It's so simple. And yet we need to listen to this 30 hours. It opens something for everyone because it compiles long history of observations, experiments, experiences and reflections in a nice, easy to understand way. What's also great is that Robert writers in a very practical way. First you recognize issue, then you become aware of it, then you learn how to deal with it and take action.,,The books is simple. The laws are simple. But how important they are and how often we forget about them in our daily life. It's not about becoming an ultimate human being. It's about taking at least some action towards being better every single day. So, my advice would be to reread this peace of art once a year. Remind yourself of your nature, your roots and meaning. And become happier.,This book is an overreach of knowledge. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are many wonderful nuggets in this book. The advice, however, is only good for a segment of the population.,Examples:,When describing the evolution of an individual, it appears he believes that everyone will follow his life progression; that is being a rebellious youth who fights against his parents thinking. I would wager half the population are not wild child‚Äôs and rebel against their parents.,From this projection, he goes on to explain the importance of fighting against the old ideas of the past. His advice: when your gut is telling you not to fight against the establishment, that means you should push even harder. Wow. Really?,Another example of bad advice is when discussing how we should view death, that we should view our impending death as a deadline to create more urgency in life. This is the kind of advice one gives when they have just begun to contemplate death and is in itself a coping mechanism. This is horrible advice for the anxious mind but perhaps good advice for someone who thinks like Mr Greene.,The advice given will be great for some but devastating for others. Some of the bad advice is benign, such as looking into the stars at night to get a sense of the sublime. I have always felt the sublime by doing this but my wife has an opposite experience: it scares her.,This book would be great if after the stories, multiple perspectives were given with an understanding of individual personalities, rather than one guy‚Äôs opinion taken as laws. And also, 27 hours? Really? I think those who rated this so high perhaps were not listening with a questioning mind and were then influenced by the endowment affect: ‚ÄúI committed much of my life to this so it must be of great value.‚Äù,,Robert tempers the aggressive macheavellian tone from his past works like The Laws of Power  into something much more real. I would like to believe this is much closer to the real Robert. This monster has the value and volume of a half dozen quality books, and after 20 hours I was still totally engaged.,Plays fine at 1.2 speed but still very long. Mostly interesting biographies followed by sometimes tangential but often thoughtful analysis, or opinion rather, but a reasonable opinion  except for ... well, I'm not into Jungian archetypes or Freudian explanations.,I listened to the whole book, tired just  near the end when it seemed a little too much, generational differences oversimplified, death a bit much.  I liked the chapter on groups and group dynamics, that's one of many I'd recommend.  But why such laborious biographies?  Bit hard getting through some, but if you know it's half biography going in, your probably ok.,,I‚Äôm kidding, I purchased both the audio and hard cover. Just on the first law I was blown away on how I thought I was rational but in reality I‚Äôm not. My favorite part of chapter 1 is something along the lines of ‚Äúalways look for the evidence that discredits your most cherished beliefs and the beliefs of others‚Äù,if you are like me and someone who loves having a better understanding of people and where some of their actions and attitudes comes from this book is great.,additionally it's a great book to help you check yourself and some of your own bad habits and insecure behaviors..,If you are a parent or leader of any sort, I recommend this book.,I love listening to this audiobook but I really dont like this narrator. I feel like the narrator is very bland compared to previous narrators from Robert previous books. I usually get swept into the story when I listen to Robert audiobooks but this one I have to really try to pay attention. The information is good but it the dude reading his book that really makes it very dull. I really hope they release another narrator for this book.,It got such good reviews that I was really looking forward to this book about human nature. I should have guessed from the title (I know The Laws of... is how he titles his books) and from his first big book The Laws of Power that this would be about how to use information about someone to put them down or build yourself up. He writes about empathy, but then explains how to use that to gain the upper hand. He explains that if you gather cues from someone you meet that they have negative body language responses to you, you should know to walk away, instead of asking yourself if there may be a reason why (I'm not infallible either and may be emitting negative cues), giving them a chance that they may be having an off day, or that they may be living a tough life. Perhaps I dislike this book so much because I work as a health care practitioner and I have these difficult first encounters all the time. Those people in pain (physical or emotional) have often already been so pushed away by others that his advice to walk away I think is inhumane. If a reader is making the attempt to get to understand human nature better, why only teach how they can use to to their own personal gain? Too bad. I didn't mind the lessons (I wouldn't call them ""laws""), but I didn't like the recommendations on how to apply the teachings."

This anthology is amazing. I particularly love that Cobbler finally gets some leading man print time. The crossover with Monk was solid. Great job by all the authors and as always Ray Porter is the best!,every book, every short story. Jonathan maberry is has become my favorite author. the depth of character development and the ""thriller"" crescendo are second to none. the short story Cobbler and the ""dumb dog"" is fantastic and had me laughing throughout. keep them coming!,I am a huge fan of both the Joe Ledger books and Ray Porter, who is in my opinion, is the best narrator in the business.  However, these are objectively a collection of some of the most creative enjoyable stories I have read/heard in a very long time!  Each story is exceptional and the characters captivating.  I do have to say that Dumb Dog and Cobbler are my all-time favorites.  Bravo!  Very Well Done!"

The Christmas Bookshop,"Friendship,Small Town & Rural,Women's Fiction",Literature & Fiction,"For something that is supposed to be a holiday book, it is nothing but whiney, irritating, annoying, and to top it off - FILTHY LANGUAGE!!!  When I read a book, I do not want to feel like I need to wash my eyes/ears out with soap because of the crass use of disgusting language. Incredibly disappointing!!!!,A truly delightful Christmas-themed audiobook which grabbed my attention and interest within the talented plot development of the first chapter. Jenny Colgan can write exquisite character revelation and humorous scenes between prickly Carmen and her perfectionistic sister Sofia. They are in their thirties now and their devoted mother still aims to stop the competition between them: she hopes the best gift of all will be that her beloved two daughters learn to get along!,,When preparations for Christmas begin in November, Carmen has just lost her job in a satellite city and she joins the family in Edinburgh by residing in perfect Sofia‚Äôs perfect basement under the footsteps of her boisterous three little ones ‚Äî Pippa, Jack, and the irrepressible little Phoebe. Other notable and well-defined people in this book include:- gentle yet sad Mr. McCredie (her new boss at an olde book shoppe in historic section of the capital); Mrs. Marsh (the exacting Department Store previous-boss with one wide apparent bosom); Federico (Sofia‚Äôs hardworking husband); Blair (a rather spoiled yet charming celebrated bestselling author); Okie or Oaky (?) a noble and appealing Quaker-truth-telling dendrologist (tree specialist) hired to give popular lectures at the university. Also included are helpers for Sofia (pregnant with her fourth), various witches who attend a winter solstice party at an Occult Magic Shop on Victoria Street, etc.,,The book is rife with witty dialogue, and happy children, angry adult misunderstandings, fun adventures (the most exciting to me being a visit to the Hall of Mirrors maze at the winter fair). There are some situations to be fixed, mysteries to be solved, and a fascinating love triangle to be settled in this lively story well delivered to us by the excellent performance artist, Eilidh Beaton. My recommendation? One of the very BEST Christmas tales available to hear on Audible. It‚Äôs superb.,Recommended for those looking for a modern Christmas story that is not about girls meets boy, rejects boy and they marry on Christmas Eve. Yes, there is flirting and potential relationships but so much more. The characters begin as stereotypes, and as the story progresses most of the characters become more. I enjoyed listening to this story in the days leading up to Christmas. I was looking for something light but not full of cheese. Highly recommend! üéÑüìöüí´,This book is truly awful. The main chapter has no redeeming qualities. The author writes for 14 year olds. Who wants to read chapter after chapter of whining children‚Äôs‚Äô dialogue? The narrator really gets into it too, which makes it even more awful. Screeching inane junk that has nothing redeeming about it. The only thing worse is an author who repeatedly and lovingly transcribes animal sounds. ‚ÄúM- EE- OO-WW‚Äù! Since the tile is about a bookshop and it‚Äôs set in Edinburgh I had hoped for something entertaining and maybe a little bit substantive? Not even close. I‚Äôm purging this puerile drivel from my library.,Her best yet, and the narration is lovely. This might be my favorite listen all year.,The person reading this is terrible. I am disappointed. I just couldn't get past the high pitched whiney version of the main character.  It just didn't make me like her or even want to finish this book. What a waste of money.,I couldn‚Äôt get into the story as the narration was SO offensive and grating. I was very excited to read a Christmas book leading up the madness of the holidays; this one was not it!,The story was ok. I may have enjoyed it more with a different reader. The reader makes most of the characters sound like whining brats. Maybe that was how the author meant them to sound? I‚Äôm not sure.,GoodStory line . But too much swearing and other. bad language. This  so difficult to listen to I could not finish it. too bad too the story was a njce. I will not be suggesting this book too anyone!!!!!,Nice light read. Interesting characters.

I voluntarily listened to a free copy of this and am giving an honest opinion. The narrators did a stunning job bringing the characters and story to life. Kudos!!!,,I love these stories!  So much intrigue in this mafia world! I enjoyed getting to know these characters. Thomas Locklear and Delaney Dawson are the narrators.

It is a great start for this new arc that I cannot wait for. Volume 9 is already in pre-order by the time I wrote this, so let's go.,What I like about this volume was that we get to see the siblings reunion after a falling out. Also two powerful men finally burying the hatchet.,I expected this to be one of my lesser favorites while waiting for volume 10 but the story and flow of events is awesome int his volume! Definitely will be relistening to this soon.,only down side is soumas lack of progress with his relationships, he doesnt progress or move on with them, id like to see growth with his relationships, romance and getting closer, apart from alise all he does is pat his future wives on the head, its a bit weird."

Morning Star,"Fantasy,Adventure,Dystopian,Hard Science Fiction",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This series broke my heart a million times. It made me forget what I was doing and tune out the world. It made me hold my breath and laugh out loud. This is some seriously good writing. I'm normally not a Sci Fi girl but I'm so glad I tried this out. The world is expertly crafted and I fell in love with the characters. I feel like they are my friends and I'm sad that it's over.,I highly recommend this to anyone who loves an excellent story with believable characters who are flawed and imperfect but make you love them, forgive them, cheer for them and cry for them.,Tim Gerard Reynolds is also one of my favorite readers (why I got this book in the first place actually, along with a good review from someone I follow) and he did an amazing job, as always.,Split the atom's heart, and lo!,Within it thou wilt find a sun.,-Persian Mystic Poem,Not great, but good enough. Finished the series. It was popcorn with butter. And, sometimes, what you want is popcorn with butter. This isn't Isaac Asimov or Philip K Dick. Pierce Brown isn't aiming for great SciFi lit. He's aiming for movie rights, readers, and finds an unplowed row between Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, Divergent, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones. It is a steroid Space Opera with the subtlety of a freight train filled with frat boys.,I think the strength of Brown is his characters and his occasionally artful phrase. His weaknesses is he sometimes runs into SciFi cliche, his plots are fairly predictable, and the whole set-up is far too clean. It was written to be a large-budget movie more than a novel. It was written to sell, too option, and yes read, but not to feed or inspire.,When I remember they are written more for my teenage kids, I am more forgiving. Not everyone can write with the messy heart of Philip K Dick or the control of Dan Simmons. Brown can write about death and suffering and still make it feel warm and sunny. His prose lacks the gravitas to REALLY pull off suffering. When Brown writes about death, it feels like a teenager writing about sex or a white man writing about racism. I know I'm probably taking this review and the whole series way more serious than I need too. I don't think it breaks any new ground. I don't think the stakes are huge. It is entertainment for the masses. It is SciFi bread and circuses, and I guess that is fine for a couple days. Watching gladiators battle in space is always good for a bit of blood and even made me forget Trump for a couple minutes every day. And that IS a good thing.,Morning Star, Pierce Brown's thrilling conclusion to the Red Rising trilogy more than lives up to expectations based on the the first two volumes. What begins from the low point with Darrow's capture at the end of volume 2, proceeds through a series of two steps forward and one step back as Darrow must constantly second guess both his friends and enemies while he continues to excel at doing the unexpected. The core of the resolution of the multiple eight balls Darrow finds himself behind is to methodically pick apart the societal hold by exploiting the weaknesses and animosities among the outer worlds, Mars (meaning the jackal) and the core. Rather than a systematic, well executed take-down, the denouement morphs into one potential catastrophe after another until even in the face of eventual victory Brown still manages to surprise with left field turn of events.,The sci-fi elements are muted with no new elements relative to earlier installments and stay well in the background as a supporting role. Beyond the thriller aspects of the storytelling, Brown explores relationships along with differing attitudes and beliefs that drive the main characters around Darrow. Each supporting character, Mustang, Cassius, Sevro, Victra, Roque, Quicksilver, etc. have different, but equally valid perspectives on their drives and ambitions. The intimacy of their various interactions is poignant and moving and is a compelling component of the appeal of the tale. At the same time, Darrow is continually making tough, less than ideal choices that completely satisfy few and leave many worse off than before. In this way, the tale is closer to ""real life"" than expected, especially in utilizing the ""fog of war"". Finally, while Darrow succeeds in achieving his overarching goal, Brown leaves the reluctant revolutionist with the unenviable task of remolding society while bracketed by potential enemies and the disillusioned,leaving plenty of fodder for future installments. One glaring omission was the noticeable absence of Harmony.,The narration is simply outstanding with sheer mastery of the range of voices of both genders. Tone, pace, and mood are expertly handled to render a nonstop can't put down attraction that dovetails nicely with the author's ""seat of the pants"" writing pace.,If I would have known how great a series I was about to get into, I would have waited for a weekend where I was not so busy. I blew through these books in 4 days. The feeling of satisfaction I had after reading the last page was sublime. Anyone who has a great imagination pick this book up.,The first 2 books were very good, that made Morning Star a sore disappointment. The story is no longer appealing to a mature audience, as if takes a sharp turn to YA at its worst. The story starts in the crazed head of the main protagonist being tortured and in delirium, and it seems like it never gets out of it!,You have to bear listening to the constant mood swings and insecurities twirling in his head. This moment's cunningly clever hero, is just an adolescent boy 20 seconds later. Also, there are constant reflections about the past events and characters long gone and forgotten ""after academy"".,The performance is good but slow, I had to speed Audible's speed to 1.25x to avoid the boring storyline.,I usually have 2 audiobooks going at once since I listen to one book while commuting and another while running. For the most part, the two books stay in their assigned places but occasionally one of the two books will grab my attention and cause me to listen to it continuously across both activities. Morning Star was such a book.,As this series has gone on I have found myself more and more invested in it. Red Rising was good but I felt that it contained a few standard YA tropes that forced me to keep my distance. Golden Son was better but as the middle story of the trilogy it was a bridge that went nowhere ending with a cliffhanger. That left Morning Star with a built in obligation to build upon the unfinished foundation laid before it and it does not fail to deliver. For me it was the best book of the series.,Darrow's exploits in this one contain highs and lows alike and he finds that he must make a final determination of the trustworthiness of almost every person in his life. From the dead who helped shape him to the living who still try to manipulate him, Darrow melds all of their influences together with his own opinions to finally become himself. He no longer fights for Eo's vision or Ares' cause but rather for his own reasons. He has all sigils removed from his hands and transforms himself into a simple human that is neither red nor gold. He has no color at all and represents the future that he desires to create for all of humanity.,,Pierce Brown takes you a non-stop wild adventure ride in this one and he keeps you guessing. Sometimes you are in on the plans, and sometimes you are not, but you never lose interest in the outcome. The events build to a final showdown with the Sovereign and every character is eventually forced to pick a side to stand on. Loyalties are up in the air until the very end but this one is no cliffhanger.,Tim Gerard Reynolds is brilliant once again and without a doubt enhances the written word with his narration. Is this book perfect? No it isn't but I am not going to dwell on any negatives as they are easy to overlook. It grabbed my attention from the start and didn't let go until it was over which makes this the best book of the series.,Break the chains!,,I really wanted to like this series...... but oh my I just wanted to slap them, so predictable ,  lower class people find hero, he rises in the ranks to become top Hero, he  makes friends, lose his friends, always has a positive attitude always thinks the best of everyone gets stabbed in the back over and over and over again all three books same situation , he gets one step forward and he get knocked back two steps ,  it was everything I could do to get through book 3 .,I do believe the narration was one of the best I've heard lately but the story I can only give two stars,  just wasn't my cup of  tea .,I loved the first book. I liked the second book. Will not finish the third book. I‚Äôm done at the end of chapter 57.  Brown‚Äôs propensity to kill off main characters bothered me but I kept slogging through. Not anymore. Reality in this world is too depressing to want to escape to this one where every once of compassion and friendship is met with a knife in the back. When you kill off all the lovable sidekicks you destroy the story. On a positive note, Tim Gerard Reynolds is great as usual and the reason I stumbled upon this series.,The quality of the trilogy goes steadily down from the first book to this one. I am a huge fan of fantasy and scifi and I am usually a forgiving audience, but here the book feel off my hands in the last 10 chapters. The author seems to repeat multiple times completely artificial crises in the flow of the story. I felt multiple times that the mental process was ""I feel the tension is going down and I don't know what to do next, let create a crisis out of the blue and kill one of the main characters, maybe it will mask the weakness in the script"". These artificial twists kept kicking me out of the story and wiping out the suspension of disbelief, until I stopped listening 7 chapters from the end.,The narrator on the other hand is really good, he was just not able to salvage the disastrous flaws in the stories.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,I think the author just ran out of ideas at the end. I wanted to like this book. But when the protagonist keeps falling into the same idiotic traps making the same wrong decisions with SOMETIMES THE SAME F******** people.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Tim Gerard Reynolds ‚Äì was your favorite?,the narrator was flawless!,What character would you cut from Morning Star?,All the stupid decisions. Make bad hard to overcome circumstances. And make it hard to overcome. Not seemingly hard to overcome situations that are somehow easily done. Then a huge debacle of juvenile decisions,What a book! loved the twists and turns.  Some you could see coming but others were out of nowhere.  highly recommend the all three books. TGR is a brilliant narrator, he took a great story and breathed life into the characters, so consistent, convincing and nuanced.,,A  satisfying finale to the trilogy, gripped me throughout.,Steady downbeat narration kept an often bloody storyline on track.,Enough plot twists & reveals to sustain the story length.,I'm left feeling bereft after going on the often  heartbreaking, action packed, twisting, messy yet beautiful journey with Darrow through this trilogy. A new favourite and more mature and vast in its scope than many dystopian novels. Gritty yet touching with moments of humour that made me laugh out loud (something I seldom do when reading). The audiobook narration is great and adds rather than detracts from the telling although frustrating when I was literally gripping the edge of my seat wishing I could speed through to find out what's next.,if all that isn't enough to tempt you to read then know I rarely leave reviews but these three truly deserve all the accolade and I'm just sad it's over.,Best audio book I have listened to.. I cried. Laughed.. And got excited,But without the skills of the narrator it would not have been half as good....,Well done to both,I've loved this trilogy, listened to all 3 in one week.  The story is captivating and fast paced, but I never got lost.  The narrator does an excellent job.  highly recommend, this (I believe) transcends across genres, well worth a go even if you don't traditional enjoy sci fi fantasy, there is far more here!,Oh my. What a ride that was! This book trilogy was gory damn fantastic! I'll definitely be listening again in the future!!,What a magnificent trilogy! I was completely enthralled from beginning to end and felt every single emotion imaginable inbetween. I was initially discouraged with the 'space/sci-fi' concept but they are genuinely one of the most gripping stories that I have ever known; an identifiable concept despite the alien backdrop. Truly engaging characters, wonderful narration and non-stop excitement - I cannot recommend the entire trilogy highly enough. Tremendous!,An excellent conclusion to a fantastic epic tale. Great narration. Altogether a wonderful work of art,This book broke me.,I adored Red Rising, looking past the sexism, homophobia, and downplay of the seriousness of sexual assault and torture. This love continued through Golden Son, which continued with alarm bells starting to ring, but the quality of writing and my emotional hook to the characters pulled me through.,I made the mistake of believing there might actually be something to this series and the message the author was trying to get across, but the mask slipped badly here. The sexism and homophobia continued throughout this series, hitting new highs with a confrontation that vaguely implied that noone is out as Queer in the Society without any kind of thought or discussion, the reversal of nostalgia into misogynistic denigration of Eo, and the 'pro-life' discussion of her pregnancy. Revealing a founding member of the Sons of Aeries as an 'ethical' capitalist who soliloquies about how capitalism is the only way for innovation and exploration, without any questioning or exploration is disgusting, false, and propaganda.,I long had concerns about the 'great man' approach of Darrow and authoritarian organisation of the resistance, but him as figurehead and those with the knowledge and skills to lead in the consuming war was one thing, but the utter callousness with which abhorrent decisions are made that effect hundreds of millions of innocent people and the 'acceptable' civilian casualties that are given no emotional weight in a series that has stood out because of the strength of inner conflict and emotion, especially when juxtaposed with the reverence with which a fascist former friend is lovingly laid to rest made me sick.,This book left me uncontrollably sobbing, but not for the right reasons. I cried because a series I had become so invested in and an author I thought I could have at least a little trust in their political message truly showed centre right, liberal conservative hand, disregard for human life, and a seeming lack of understanding of their own characters and their motivations. People and characters can do awful things, but when shown to have emotional intelligence and capability to wrestle with difficult emotions and situations, but when they don't seem to care and the author clearly doesn't care enough to discuss them, that's vile. There's also a difference between being unable to feel and discuss, and just not including it.,I tried to come back and push through that last quarter, but funeral for a fascist and not a thought for those left in bondage and needlessly murdered in what was never addressed to be a monumental atrocity of a war crime left me in tears of rage again.,I had no expectations of this series actually aligning with my anarchist communist leanings, but I didn't expect this to be the literature equivalent of 'soft boys' using progressive language to manipulate and abuse, but honestly that's what this is.,I'm beyond disappointed.,Near the end the main characters make a stupid move that backfires(releasing prisoner they shouldn't ever trust) so I feel like they should really reap what they sown for their utter stupidity... Then an hour or so later the dead comes back to life, and I'm rolling my eyes, cause it's just stupid and I don't care any more whether they live or die... But then at the very end quality comes back and it has a nice ending.,This one also has some elements I personally don't like, but can't really say here...,As for performance: the audio quality is sometimes inconsistent. Not bad, but I've seen better...,Awesome characters with genuine depth, as a narrator Tim is spine tingling. as a writer, Pierce is a Jedi Master. As for the upcoming  movie, I feel like I felt when I read that an eccentric  director called Peter Jackson had aquired the rights to LOTR. As the source material was so good and so special to me I was petrified it would be slagged up.  Thankfully I couldnt have been more wrong. Bloodydamn read it and break the Chains!!!,Loved it but needed Tissues.... driving to work with tears streaming down my eyes.,Outstanding Narration, had me holding my breath,  brilliant.,There is one more book but can't listen yet, the ending to the third book could have finished the series beautifully, i was so invested in the characters i can't cope with anyone else dying so will maybe lusten to the fourth once i have recovered,A phenominal story that definately has its share of twists and turns. Made me so paniced at times i needed to stop listening and calm myself,i did struggle to complete the last of the trilogy.  Too much fluff. This book was just ok but trilogy overall was very good.,Honestly, i'm so upset that this book series is over.,I've bonded to every single one of these characters, I laughed and cried with them, and felt true sorrow at certain points in this book.,The Author writes life into these people.,Pierce, you bastard how dare you make me love this book so much.,I'm going to go back and listen to the whole series again, and when i get the money, i'm going to get hard copies.,,If any of you have doubt's about the series, please don't the books are a true spark of the imagination.,,Pierce, you've just earned yourself a life long fan, and i look forward to your future work.,Without a doubt, the best trilogy I have ever read. Brown has catapulted himself into the upper echelons of literary greatness.,Loved this whole series. It was like riding a roller coaster! Well written, well narrated, brilliant characters and unpredictable.,Fantastic book and end to a trilogy. Brilliant world building, characters and pacing. I loved it from start to finish.,Fantastic Trilogy.  The Narrator is so skilled, the characters, the pace and expression of emotion are superb.,The complexity of the hierarchical society and the struggle for equity is brilliant üëè,Amazing. So incredibly happy I found this series. The narration is top notch and the story, whilst sometimes predictable, is phenomenal."

Huron Nights,"Small Town & Rural,Private Investigators,Women Sleuths",Literature & Fiction,"Huron Nights!!  Five Star ratings for Landon Beach the writer of this thriller and Scott Brick who masterfully narrated it. If you liked Rachel Roberts and Obidiah Ben-David solving a murder mystery in Huron Breeze, you will love them together once again solving more murders in Huron Nights. Roberts is a famous writer who is stuck trying to finish her novel while keeping her identity hidden. Ben-David, a don‚Äôt-mess-with-me retired veteran cop is filling in for the local investigator and reaches out to Rachel to join forces again to help solve the recent murders of Artie and Misty Jenson. They were the owners of the most prestigious estate on Lake Huron.  Any one of the characters could have had a motive to murder the Jensons‚Ä¶ the lazy, somewhat cut off entitled online gaming son, Mark Jensen, or one of the envious socialite neighboring couples, or the townie, Joey Pavin, who runs a local seedy hotel, or another online gamer as well as drifter, Curt Ballard, or could it be someone else??!!,While trying to figure out who the murderer is, both Beach and Brick easily draw the listeners in so they feel like they are personally experiencing every emotion and situation along with the characters.,We get to know new and interesting characters in Huron Nights, but Beach also weaves in some former favorites, one being Roberts‚Äô agent, the sarcastic, quick-witted Topaz. She adds laugh-out-loud humor and we can‚Äôt get enough of her!  Also, throughout the process of solving the murders, Rachel‚Äôs writing is once again ignited and she finds a new beginning.,Beach weaves this perfect novel together with unexpected twists, imagination, and constant suspense. In tandem with Beach‚Äôs top notch writing and Brick‚Äôs superb narration, the listeners will be constantly anticipating of what's lurking around the corner!  In the end, Landon Beach expertly brings it all together but not without many surprises. Huron Nights reminds me of the great detective stories of novelist, Agatha Christie!  If you‚Äôre looking for a new author, look no further than Landon Beach.  His many excellent books can be enjoyed by everyone!,,"

The Edge,"Crime,Mystery,Thriller & Suspense,International Mystery & Crime,Suspense",Literature & Fiction,"I couldn't put it down! I've been totally captured in this thrilling tale for the past 2 days. I listened to it every moment I got! excellent performance by the narrator's. Baldacci always keeps you on the hook until the end!,I downloaded the book when I woke the morning of release, and finished it before I slept again.  Even listened as I sat for over an hour in the dentist chair.  It‚Äôs that good!,I am convinced that Mr. Baldacci can write a thriller about a sloth, and I would love it.,Seriously, I enjoyed the book very much.  Thumbs up!,,definitely not up to David Baldacci standard. not exciting,  very cookie cutter. Don't waste your $,Book 2 in the series doesn't disappoint; exceptional narration and plot compromised by poor editing that comes across as robotic and unnatural and seemingly v amateur. Didn't expect this from a Balducci work. Would recommend Mike Charzuk and Audible Studios‚Ä¶they produce the Gray Man series and if you listen to The Edge vs any Gray Man you‚Äôll understand the difference.,Look forward to the next one in the series, hopefully, with higher production quality.,The story was fairly average. Not quite the Baldacci I enjoyed in the past. But what was the most disappointing was the narration. The narrator seemed excessively monotone most of the time. In addition, I am not a fan of the multiple narrator approach at all. I‚Äôm hoping for better with the next work. Ôøº,A great follow up to the 6:20 Man‚Ä¶ the voice cast really got the tone and characteristics of the characters they inhabited making the audio very gripping and enjoyable!  Can‚Äôt wait for the next installment.,Love the ongoing mystery to solve, love the ability and competence of Levine, love the ambiance of the story, the ongoing description of the weather and terrain. Reminded me of the Jesse Stone movies/books by Robert Parker.,This book is full of so many twists and turns that I could hardly keep up. I listened to it the entire day and finished up this morning. It‚Äôs one of those books that you just don‚Äôt want it to end because it‚Äôs so good. Zachary Webber is one of my favorites and his outstanding narration added to the pleasure of listening to this book. I also enjoyed the added narrators this time. I can‚Äôt wait for the next Travis Devine/6:20 Man!,Book kept my interest, I like the characters and want to know what's next!! The narration was perfect. Great job."

The Fellowship of the Ring,"Classics,Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"I own the Rob Inglis narration, and he did quite a decent job. I mean no disrespect at all to him. I've listened to it dozens of times.,However, when I heard that Andy Serkis was doing a new narration of what I consider some of the finest books ever written in the English language, I just about died. I knew instantly he would be brilliant, and I was not mistaken.,His talent is off the charts. He's one of the finest actors of his generation. He was flawless in the films.,I'm not finished with these new releases yet, but so far I have not one single complaint to make. As expected, he's incredible.,The only narrators I can think of who would be anywhere near this performance would be Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, or Cate Blanchett, and they wouldn't be better. That's some of the highest praise I could ever pay anyone. My mother read these books to me while I was still in the womb, and 56 years later the story remains an essential, vital part of my life.,Thank you, Andy. Thank you for this masterpiece of narration.,I love LotR. Have read many many times. This performance? You can just hear him pushing each syllable to sound like its the climax of the whole story.  Andy... less is more. Did Tolkien mean for Gandalf to be angry with every word he says? WOW he sounds like pissed off Batman the whole story.. I want my credits back,Andy Serkis is not simply a narrator; do not look here for a bed time story. Rob Inglis and his more traditional narration would serve you better if you would like to listen while you drift off. Serkis makes it entirely impossible‚Äîit is hard to fall asleep when you are so immersed in his storytelling. He has a unique voice that brings each character alive. He pays homage to the familiar voices that many of us associate with the cast of LOTR, but also uniquely marks each with his own tonal signature. This is quite literally the best narration of Tolkien‚Äôs work. Listening to Inglis is to be greeted with a familiar and beloved story. Listening to Serkis is to fall directly into Middle Earth.,I have already reviewed this once.  I come back to it because I am disconcerted by all the comparisons between this and the Rob Inglis performance.  Both were exceptional in their own ways.  Every narrator is going to have their own interpretation on any given story.  Tolkien fans should feel exceptionally blessed for having multiple interpretations to choose from.  I have personally enjoyed both readings of the original text.  I have enjoyed each for different reasons.  Criticism for one reader over another seems counter productive.  If you like one reader then listen to them.  I just enjoy Tolkien.  I love both readings because they are both the original text with different interpretations.  Don't we have enough controversy with the new Rings of Power series without adding to it by arguing who reads the definitive text better?  Please quit arguing over this.  Tolkien fans who enjoy his actual words should be supportive of each other.  Not tearing each other apart over which narrator was better.,Andy Serkis is really amazing.... I‚Äôve read and heard the other audiobook... this by far is the best...would highly recommended.,Serkis performs SO spectacularly its amazing.  If you have never read or have been thinking about re entering this world now is the time to do so!,Just wow. Andy Serkis  does a stunning reading of LoTR. If you haven‚Äôt read it, are a enthusiast, an Andy Serkis fan, or if you have a few spare credits pick this up!,The Fellowship of the Ring takes me back in time to my high school days (when I first read it). New life is breathed in. It‚Äôs a perfect reading.,This abomination seems to be an attempt to dramatize every word that Tolkien wrote. Words imply meaning - at least to Tolkien and myself. The way Serkis reads this it appears he thinks that every word only implies excitement or suspense. It's impossible to listen to and loses Tolkien.,,It gets worse when the dialogue starts. Serkis decides to go full voice acting. The most disturbing part of this is how it illustrates his complete lack of self awareness: he has zero voice acting talent in a live reading setting. What we end up with are cartoon characters with different accents. How am I supposed to follow the story when Aragorn now sounds like Batman? It gets worse. Serkis then decides to ""dramatize"" his already full voice acting. The result is something resembling anyone's worst nightmares about bad method acting.,,I frankly do not believe any of the good reviews. And anyone saying this is better than Rob Inglis' masterpiece should be viewed with absolute suspicion.,Andy Serkis tells this story with just as much attention and enthusiasm as he did ‚ÄúThe Hobbit‚Äù last year and the moment he started narration I knew he was going to blow this out of the water.,I used to get sleepy during the slow bits of LotR and The Hobbit. And forget reading the songs‚ÄîI skipped them every time. That was until Andy Serkis brought new life back into the telling of this greatest of tales. Serkis is a joy to listen to. I was grinning like a fool during my commute to and from work as Frodo and gang made their way out of the shire. Serkis‚Äôs narration of the barrow wights has so far been the highlight (they have only just left Bree).,,You need these audiobooks in your life! Get The Hobbit while you‚Äôre at it, and start praying for a Silmarillion update to go with it (although I‚Äôd love Ian McKellan giving the Silmarillion a shot‚ÄîChristopher Lee‚Äôs narration on Children of Hurin is great as well!)."

Husband and Wife,"Crime Thrillers,Domestic Thrillers,Psychological","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","I enjoy many of Daniel Hurst‚Äôs books. So far they have had a good mixture of marriage/family secrets and mystery/suspense. I love that he tells the story, without extra fluff, just to put words on a page. I thought the narrator did a wonderful job.,This was a great read! I really enjoyed the narration, the plot, the characters and the build up to figuring out what was going on. A lot of discoveries at the very end too! Ôøº,Riveting and suspenseful until the shocking end! Very good storyline and narration. Would definitely recommend.,This was a very suspenseful and great listen. I didn't want to shut it off. The way this author takes you through the story is twisty and eventful. Great book. I recommend listening.,This was great! Kept me guessing until the end.   I had a hard time putting it down.,I could not stop listening to this, there seemed to be a new twist or turn at every chapter. This has to be one of my new favorites.,The author needs to give the reader more credit. Spoon fed the whole way, which is unusual in a mystery.  She repeated facts over and over. It was not terrible thus the three stars. But geez get on with it. Narration was great.,Keeps you flipping the page until you get to the bottom of it. You won‚Äôt know until it‚Äôs almost to the end,My first book by Slater. I read a lot of these kind of books. This was superior in every way. The end WAS a surprise that was deftly revealed. I highly recommend this book.,The story was intriguing from start to finish. I could not stop listening! Definitely recommend to anyone who likes suspense/mystery novels.,Absolute page Turner. I was gripped from the first chapter and could not stop listening. Another great book.,didn't make it to the end, found it boring, I kept going back to see if I had missed parts, but i hadn't! it was just dragging on but going nowhere... shame, another wasted credit,I like that the end is not usually what you expect but the author uses too many words to say absolutely nothing. create a huge amount of suspence then at the end of the chapter say but he knew it was all his fault! it might work for sometime but every single book is the same. i simply fast forwarded to the last hour of the book and still understood the whole book. all the words in between didn't take away anything to enhance my understanding of the story.,Another great story from this author. The characters are well written and easy to relate to. The story has twists and turns keeping you guessing right up until the end. The narration was just perfect with a good range of characters voices with a steady and interesting flow.,I was already on the back foot when I began listening. Not massively impressed with the author and I wasn‚Äôt sure about the narrator. I WAS SO WRONG!,Very slow, did not shock or excite, the early magic has gone, the same story is being retold.,Enjoyed this story so much that I missed a night‚Äôs sleep!  The characters are well drawn and the narrative tension is sustained until the final couple of chapters. Only one part loose-end (was it really suicide?) but most of the strands are well tied up. Great narration too!,A slow beginning but picked up pace and intrigue. A good plot although the characters were on the dull side. Enjoyed it.,Clare C a favourite narrator and she is brilliant here. Each character so well defined . The plot so carefully crafted one has to KNOW..!,Great story. Great narration. I found the going backward and forward interesting. I would highly recommend,liked the twists . wasn't the best book of hers but the twists were good,Lots of twists and turns. It had me guessing till the end. Well worth a read.,Binge listened to this over a day! Could not put it down, brilliant. Didn‚Äôt guess that ending,I liked the twist, subject matter was a bit close to home but the story was interesting and I totally thought I‚Äôd figured it out but was happily wrong haha good narration too.,I really enjoyed this book. well written and narrated. the storyline kept me glued! will be listening to this authors books in the future,,I've loved every single KL Slater book. This one was no exception. Did not expect that ending!,Twists and turns in plot and good character build and all loose ends tied up at the end,I was sucked in straight away from the prologue! The way the story has been written is so intriguing and the ending had me gobsmacked!!!,Excellent narration by Clare Corbett, she made the characters real & believable. I always enjoy KL Slater‚Äôs books,Great story and very exciting but also easy to read / listen to. Would recommend to anyone who loves a good crime story."

The Takedown,,,"I swear Phillips Soo was born to narrate Lily Chu novels.,This one was excellent and by far my favorite. Can‚Äôt wait to hear what‚Äôs next for Chu ü´∂üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è,Philippa Soo is fantastic. Realistic character growth is what I enjoy the most about Lily Chu books! Adorkable main and affable supporting characters, not overly drawn out act III separation, and I appreciated the focus on work drama as the framework and main through line.,Felt great to listen to emotionally healthy people figure out challenges w modern life, w grace and respect.,Yet again, Lily Chu has outdone herself! Teddy and Daiyu‚Äôs love story is so beautiful and built off of an amazing friendship. Not only does this story touch on love of a partner, it shows a love of family and how hard generational trauma is to overcome.,I love the character development, story and overall message from the book. The progression of the daily affirmations may have been my favorite part. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one.,I loved the humor and complexity in this book. I resonated deeply with the main character and loved watching her grow and win.,I am going to probably be in the minority here, but this Chu did not sparkle and fizz like her previous books. The writing is still as capable, but this more than references the culture wars, and ventures into crusade. Fiction is meant to be an escape from real life. It is supposed to be an adventure into fantasy so you can leave the drudgery of reality behind. I don‚Äôt want to be lectured by my fiction. Especially my romance fiction that is supposed to have a twist of humor. This is tired, with heavy boots on its feet, and I started to feel exhausted about midway through.,Soo is a favorite narrator. She is able to pull meaning from passages and shine a spotlight on them.  I‚Äôm not so sure she was feeling this one. Her delivery was as flat and featureless as the inside of a cardboard cereal box. Plus, the many obvious insertions of re-recorded segments bothered me to distraction. I may be wrong here, but do I detect AI?  The edited portions sounded robotic and tinny and exactly like Siri and Alexa. They did not sound recorded in a booth but more like digital production.,Other than all that, I liked it enough to finish it. It was a free gift so I can‚Äôt complain but it certainly doesn‚Äôt compare, in any way, to ‚ÄúThe Comeback‚Äù.,if a self-help book and an HR manual got together to have a baby, this would be it. it was full of clich√©s and lacked depth. I didn't really care about the characters. it's ashamed because I really liked the first 2.,Much different than her first novel, but I loved them both!  Dry humor and wit‚Ä¶very fun to read.,It was a fun listen with a storyline that keeps you engaged and characters that have real conflict and dialogue. Really enjoyed it and would recommend to others!,The writing in this book is good, funny mostly and easy to listen to‚Ä¶. except that our hero falls for someone they‚Äôre mostly met on a kind of wordle type treasure hunt, meets them in real life, them likes them more.,Our hero has lost her job, puts up with her family who have moved into her small house as she wants to keep the peace.  Gets a new job, refuses to rock the boat as she wants to climb the corporate ladder.,Meets boy on a meeting, he is quiet and detached.  Immediately dislikes him for not wanting to rock the boat and accuses him of wanting to climb the corporate ladder.,He says he is trying to keep the peace with his dad, and is scolded for doing the same thing our hero does.,Stopped listening at that point as the hypocrisy was getting worse.,I thought the workplaces made an interesting setting for a story, and the use of a local on-line treasure-hunt style game was a lovely idea. Dee's family issues made a nice source of stress for her character, and an opportunity for her to develop those relationships. The ""should we shouldn't we"" near workplace romance was another nice touch,,The way this story was written, with a lot of Dee's thoughts narrated, made it one of the few present-tense stories I actively enjoyed. But there were instances where I wasn't entirely clear which parts were narrative and which were dialogue!,The Takedown was another pacy, delightful story - the cr√®me de la cr√®me of offerings in the Audible membership plus catalogue.,Chu‚Äôs stories weave likeable characters on a path to finding and growing a love that deepens and evolves as the narrative unfolds.,There‚Äôs emotional depth, and some real and big issues of our times handled with  deftness, sensitivity and nuance.,Having personal experience  of the most toxic elements of toxic positivity in a very different life scenario, it felt timely to have elements of this thorny issue narrativised in a very particular social and cultural setting which Chu can educate listeners without ever seeming didactic, or sacrificing important topics at the expense of an overarchingingly fun and winning storyline.,I look forward to more, thank audible for a classy and welcome inclusion in their plus catalogue. More of this quality please.üôè,Another great book, narrated perfectly by Philippa Soo!  I love learning about  this tiny slice of Canadian life and the stories are such a warm and cozy listen!,Another good story. Lots of interesting topics interwoven into the story to make you think about . And a good story and characters that are real , likeable and not boring. I‚Äôm looking forward to another book by this author,As always Lily Chu has done it again with a lovely story that‚Äôs intriguing and yet gentle for listeners. Highly recommend,This romance had a lot of themes so it took a second listening to appreciate. Love it overall !,Another great story. Loved the tie ins to previous books. That you don't need to have read to enjoy this one.,I fully enjoyed this book. Philippa Soo is amazing as always and Lily Chu has a way of making her main characters feel real and relatable. A nice feel good listen through and through. I can't wait for her next great story.,Great  narration and clever funny writing.  This story was a bit different to the last two books and I loved it,loved the book and preformance. funny light hearted romance with a actual plot line with well thought out characters. I cant wait for the next book.,This is one of those books which you don‚Äôt want to put down! Although the ending was a little predictable, the plot getting there, with all the twists and turns was truly worth it.,I enjoyed this book, well written and easy to listen too, the narrator did a great job.,The his is my first Lily Chi story I have heard! Loved it and will now be looking for her other stories. Loved the story line totally üëçüèº,I have adored every Lily Chu book and this is no exception! Clever, funny and could not put it down! Philipa Soo also fabulous!! 5 stars!,I wasn‚Äôt sure at first but found myself looking forward to listening. Nice read! Thanks,Bit boring at some points. Quite nerdy. Liked the diversity topic. Have read better books, wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend this one.,Once again Lily Chu & Phillipa Soo have delivered another Stella novel!! I only wish there were more.,,Usually a fantasy reader, Lily Chu‚Äôs works have been my first real foray into modern fiction, and I have loved every second. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one."

Dishonor,"Military & War,Spiritual Growth",Biographies & Memoirs,"This is seriously an amazing powerful and heartwarming true story that everyone should read. David is very vulnerable in telling his story in hopes of reaching those that need healing and redemption. As I was listening to the audio book, my brain kicked into teacher mode and my first thought was that I would grade this as an A+ because it instantly hooks the reader's curiosity and captivates them to keep reading. David's hoice of imagery allows you to visualize and feel what he's going through. Through his choice of words, you can feel the frustration, the shame, hurt as well as sympathize with him.  His story is proof that your past does not define who you are."

Caught Stealing,Contemporary,Romance,"I love all  CE Ricci books, she never disappoints. Can‚Äôt wait to see who is in the next book of the series. So happy Christian Fox is back. He has always been one of my favorite narrators, as is Jacob Morgan.,Phoenix Mercer can't believe when his best friend Kayson sets his eyes on Leighton U's one-and-done, no strings star quarterback (and Kayson's teammate). Phoenix is determined to keep Holden Sykes away from his best friend. After all, he knows all too well what it's like to be the recipient of Holden's one-and-done treatment. Holden won't even acknowledge he knows him! Or worst, he just forgot him! He won't say he knows him AT ALL. So, no, not happening!,Holden, on the other hand, king of mischief that he is, finds all this protection highly amusing and it becomes a source of joy for him to irritate Phoenix. He has this strange feeling that ""Nix"" is ""familiar"" and that's bugging him immensely.,A forced road trip together, lazy days in the sun and the bickering and the banter turns into something more. Something they both want. Badly. There is just one little problem: Kayson.,I loved loved loved this one! C. E. Ricci is quickly becoming a favorite. I completely understand why some people get really mad at some things Phoenix does but I'm old enough to understand that we do pretty stupid things when we are young - specially if madly in love. Nope, I don't see this as a ""love triangle"", as the relationship was pretty much one-sided but I also get that you need to be loyal to your best friend.,The story is fun, kind of sweet, things get heated really quickly and boy, they sizzle. And alongside a great story you have the perfect storm of aural heaven that is ... JOX?,This is narrated by Christian Fox and Jacob Morgan and both are at the top of their game. Good dual narration takes talent because things have to flow seamlessly when two people voice the same character from different POVs. This two knocked it out of the park, as I expected,.,Show Phoenix some grace and enjoy this journey to forever love. Remember that true friends can always find a way to understand you... and forgive you.,,Another delicious book in the series. Can‚Äôt wait for the next edition in the series. Please be quick about it.üòÖ,Perfect performances!,Completely loved this one - even more than book one!  Slow build up, but so worth it.  One night stand  gone wrong - one regrets it, the other has no memory of it.  The result of having overlapping friendship circles makes for enemies turning into something much more.  Narrators were both incredible.  Can‚Äôt wait for more in this series.  They will definitely be auto preorders.,CE Ricci never disappoints. This is a well written mm romance. Its book two but, can definently standalone. Jacon Morgan and Christian Fox did an amazing job with the narration. These two are an awesome pair. This group of guys is well worth getting to know. I cant wait for more.,,Narration - 10/10,Story 10/10,Spice üî•üî•üî•,Holden and phoenix work so well - they balance one another out in the best possible way! Getting together was a wild ride.

And with Christian Fox and Jacob Morgan performing it, it's an instant buy for me! ü¶ä‚ù§Ô∏è,5 star narration. Christian Fox and Jacob Morgan are fantastic to listen to so this was no hardship. The story is absolutely boring. And slow. And dry. Almost no sex scenes. I adore these narrators but I'm never giving this author another penny because I just don't like her books.,C E Ricci is an automatic buy for me, and this book was no exception and did not disappoint. Can‚Äôt wait for more.,Honestly if I were to read this story in paper back form I'm not sure I would like it as much.

Lord of Chaos,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I love he books but stop having the women act like they are socially handicapped. Nyaneave is the most insufferable bitch i have ever come across in a book. There is no way Lan or any other man would want to to be with her. It seemed so forced that he fell in love with such a mean woman. It's not even just that. She thinks all men are dumb, even obviously capable ones like Tom, and that she is the most capable person in the world at every thing. If i was traveling with i would have defected over to the Forsaken just because of her.,This is it!  Lord of Chaos is finally out in Unabridged format!,,Jordan/WoT literati argue about their favorite scene or the best part of the series.  Ever since this book was published the battle at the wells has ranked near the top.  This book and the two before it are Jordan at his best, his most innovative and balanced.  I highly recommend the series (make sure you start with book one).,,As for the audiobook... Michael Kramer and Kate Reading have been doing the narration for all 8 unabridged editions so far and they do a very good job of it.  The only part of the narrations that bugs me in the slightest is Kramer's portrayal of Gawyn.  How come Gawyn has a Brit accent and Elayne and the Emond's Fielders have normal accents?  They're all from Andor...  Anyway, very good production quality; engrossing story; able to fit on an iPod.  What more could you ask for?,Would you listen to Lord of Chaos again? Why?,This series is very long, so I probably won't listen to it again.  Having said that, the Lord of Chaos was a good volume and kept the suspense going. I did find it a bit trying to keep all the characters straight, e.g. the Lords of the different kingdoms, the Aes Sedai and Wise Ones belonging to the different factions.What I really hate about this series are the women. I found them all distasteful and completely unbelievable:  Nynaeve pulling on her braid, Siuan swearing like a sailor, Elaine acting like a stuck up snit, the aggressiveness of the Aiel women, etc etc.   And I found it unbelievable that any man would put up with, let alone fall in love with, women who acted like, for example, Nynaeve or Faile or Aviendha.  I've never before read a book or a series where I would have been happy to see the main female characters all be killed off early on.  The only main female character I liked so far was Moraine.  I started reading the series in book form years ago, but stopped reading it because the women drove me crazy. Apparently most readers are not bothered by the depiction of the female characters, so I guess this is a matter of taste.,What did you like best about this story?,The thing I like best about the Wheel of Time series is how the characters evolve (at least the men:  Matt, Perrin and Rand).,What about Kate Reading and Michael Kramer ‚Äôs performance did you like?,I really enjoyed Kate Reading's performance - I was always glad when the narration switched over to her.  I liked the way Michael Kramer gave different characters different voices (especially Loial the Ogier), but his normal narration irritated me for some reason.  I did get used to it over the first 6 volumes, but never learned to like it.  This is of course a matter of taste, and I don't mean to be too critical.  At all times the narration of both Kate and Michael was smooth and professionally done.,I agree with another reviewer.  there is too much redescribing people and scenarios.  At some point can we stop hearing about women who ""sniff"" after they are angry about something?!  I have a running joke about this subject at home.  ""And she sniffed!""  Women think men are wool heads and stubborn, men don't know what to think about women.  Yeah bro.... We get it.,Overall this is a great story, but it could have been trimmed down a lot.,Don't worry..... only 7 more books to go.  ahhhhh :),I'm done...I literally can't stand to listen to another minute of this.  I love'd the first three books in this series, but this one was yet another painful slog through, the same die cast female characters, sniffing and straightening skirts, next to no actual character development (besides Eguaene, possibly Rand) or even  and worst of all literally only one interesting thing happening (because let's face it he told us Eguaene would be Amrlyn two or three books ago....).  Do yourself a favor skip to the last chapter then move on with your life.  There is way too much pointless and repetitive detail in this book... it downs out anything interesting that actually happened.  In order to finish this series I'm  hoping someone one can recommend an abridged edition...because I'm still curious to know how it ends, just not masochistic enough to put myself through another full book.,Any additional comments?,While still a fantastic read, this book is probably my least favorite in the series thus far, due mostly to the slow pace of things. While I greatly enjoy Robert Jordan's verbose writing style, the repetitiveness of details in this particular title did make the story seem to drag at points and I feel the constant reiteration could have easily been trimmed down without impacting the story. Aside from that, the continued outstanding plot and character development was well worth the down time and the climatic conclusion to the book made the final 8 hours extremely exciting to listen through. I might even argue it‚Äôs some of the most exciting writing in the series. Again, Michael Kramer and Kate Reading did a great job with the narration, although I still wish they had agreed upon pronunciations of certain names prior to the recording. Onward!,Would you consider the audio edition of Lord of Chaos to be better than the print version?,Overall a great story never get me wrong with that...The audio is very well done and helps with the often tedious overwrought introspection and repetitive and needless self-indulgence of the main characters and the verbal diarrhea of others.,How would you have changed the story to make it more enjoyable?,There is a great story behind the book that always seems to get lost as characters search there souls, indulge in their own introspection, complain about there plight on and on.  The books as a whole start off strong then sink into long periods of diatribe and drivel that does little for character or plot development.  The editors/author could have taken out hundreds of pages (hours of listening) and had a much stronger product.  I find myself ""not listening"" to the book as they characters drone on needlessly about nonsense with little regard to the overall plot.  Then the plot and action returns and we remember why we love these books.  Take the first dozen chapters and the last few and we have a ""cant put it down""  It is almost like we need more words for the sake of having more words.,One thing I always muse upon is the similarities in plot and characters between the wheel of time and the sword of truth. Reading one is like reading the other.,Which scene was your favorite?,There are so many great scenes in the series of books...,If you were to make a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?,Will weaton weaves as the will weaton wills hahaha,Any additional comments?,worth a listen..,Kate Reading & Micheal Kramer do a fantastic job of narating this series.  Anyone interested in High Fantasy should start this series at book 1 and not stop until they are done.  My only hope is that they will get the next book done in unabridged formate before I finish this one.,I like the story of the Wheel Of Time. It is truely epic fantasy and is a great story.  It's a shame that it wasn't told by a better author. Jordan is long-winded, and over-describes everything. It appears he was desperate for filler material so he redescribes every little thing, every time you go back to a character.,,If Jordan would simply get to telling the story, and stop repeating himself every third paragraph these books could have been done in a trilogy.,,Jordan tends to over use certain mechanics. Every woman thinks that every man is a stuborn idiot. Every man thinks that every woman is impossible to figure out. Every woman sniffs when she is put out. Every one jumps to the wrong conclusion about everything. (Rand killing Morgase, is a good example).,,I don't think I can stand to hear/read '...he could tell she was Aes Sedai by her agelss face"", or a woman gripping her skirts or arranging them again.,,I also wish that the Aiel weren't Fremen from Dune, and that Ogier's weren't straight out of Never Ending Story.,,Anyway, the story itself is a great story. Jordan can come up with wonderful fantasy. It's just a shame he can't tell it like it deserves to be told.,You are reading the best epic fantasy series there is. period. It may take a while to get into it but you will. There are 2600 plus characters but don't get scared teenagers read this every day. You will know these peoples as ""friends"" and ""enemies"" and like your own family. Read by the dynamic duo of recitation kate reading and michael kramer... they pull it all together .. I switch genres just to listen to them... It [the series] is really one huge wonderful story broken into 14 too short books that nobody wants to see ended..I can not express how good these books are. I have started 16 different friends reading TWoT and they are all addicted. You think that maybe the books are enchanted some how???,If fantasy is your genre you have arrived....... paul t.,I love the wheel of time series - love something BIG I can really lose myself in - and I love the readers too BUT!,(It's a big BUT that needs it's own paragraph!).  WHy oh Why oh Why can Kate and Michael not AGREE on how they will pronounce people's names and then STICK to it?!!!  I can just about live with Kate's ""Mwahrain"" as opposed to Michael's ""Mohrain"" but what I don't like is when Kate spends 5 books saying ""MogaDEEN"" and then suddenly switches to ""MogIDION"" now in book 6 making me start and feel irritated every time.  I can just imagine Kate going ""Mogadeen, Mogidion, whatever!"" but really Kate, when you've been given such a big contract you really could pay more attention to detail.  Not only could, I would go so far as to say, must.  Let's hope my words sink in.,I love Wheel of Time and find the performances by the narrators entertaining. The only thing I would change would be the consistency of pronunciation across the series and between the two narrators.,Any additional comments?,There are many occasions where either a double recording plays out OR, which I personally find worse, the recording is VERY BAD QUALITY!,What would have made Lord of Chaos better?,It would have been a good book if half as long. It was just padded out.,What will your next listen be?,Something more punchy,Which scene did you most enjoy?,The last battle when it finally arrived.,You didn‚Äôt love this book--but did it have any redeeming qualities?,It was well read.,Wow! This is the first real battle since Tear and The People of The Dragon. And a brilliant finish to the book. Egwene Al'Vere comes into her own, and Matt Cauthon's character really starts to shine. While some of the books I think are better than this one, it is a key pivotal moment in the saga, and not to be missed. And as with all of the Wheel of Time books, not to be missed!! I have read this book twice, and listened to it 4 times now, while progressing through the series towards book 14. Each time, the battle at Dumai's Wells at the end of the book just makes me shiver with excitement as The Dragon comes into his own, and The Black Tower shows what it can do.,My life has changed so much over the year I have read this series not so much the things that are in my life but my outlook on it. With a heavy heart I finish the last book and can confidently say with a tear in my eye this is the best book series I have read in my thousands of hours of reading and listening to them this is the first and likely the last book series that has made me cry at the end and if you are apprehensive about reading a 14 book series I can tell you now that you will not regret it at the end a phenomenal story all the way through with a pair of incredible readers makes these books my favourite of all time.,Don't know how many times I've reread the entire series but I'm doing it again, gets better every time üòè,loved it and another excellent addition to the Wheel of Time. The ending alone is worth the price.,The great number of pay-offs we get to the previous books' set-ups are so satisfying. The entire book was finished in under two weeks, and I enjoyed every hour of it. Listening to book 7 next!,I have enjoyed the series but this book felt very slow with not much action till the end. Sally I don't think I will be getting the next book in the series.,I found this book the slowest so far. Only bit of real action at end. If this was the first book I don‚Äôt believe I would continue but since it‚Äôs halfway I‚Äôm hoping the story will pick up in the second half of it all. I do wish the writer hadn‚Äôt padded it with peoples thoughts on others so much and the men vs women sexism is just over the top. A 5 out of 10 so far.,loved it! It's such a well written and thoroughly enjoyable read. You simply cannot go past the Wheel of Time series,So full on! The story just builds and builds! Rands power has become scary. Jordan is/was a mastermind of telling a story in which no one really knows what's happening until they are a physical witness to the event. It allows so much more story to unfold. Enjoying wheel of time thoroughly!,This might actually be the zenith of the series. I loathed most of the books up to this point just beyond the point of dropping the series, but this whole book was excellent. Finally, intense confrontations and real danger. Very nicely done. I hope the rest of the books going forward will be as good.,worth the read, long series but its really good, next book starts to get a little slow,just adds to the thrilling story, which you so hope will get to the climatic end and at the same time you want so much to know what will happen next.,When I start listening to these books, I have to rip myself away for them!,The story is become more and more captivating! Brilliant twists and turns!,I can't wait for the next book to see which direction the story takes.,the writing is a bit too discriptive  in places but overall I did enjoy it very much.,Slower Moving than Previous 5. Quite Political . but the reason is revealed. Worth Reading"

The Fixer,Romance,LGBTQ+,"I loved reading the book and Angela Dawe‚Äôs narration took it to another level. Excellent! The humor, tension, suspense of the story flows easily from one chapter to the next.,This book gives us a more intimate understanding of Michelle and her life choices and Eden is sunshine and breath of air.,This was an excellent read!  I had forgotten that Michelle had been in The Red File.  She‚Äôs such a great Villainess!  Now we also have Eden to contend with.  What a great combo of good vs Villainess!  They have such chemistry together, can‚Äôt wait to see them together again in the next book!  It will be marvelous!,The narrator Angela made listening to this book truly special.  Thank you!,This was an incredibly fun read. I enjoy Lee Winter as a writer, but The narrator Angela Dawes is just the GOAT. I love to listen to her. She has a way of breathing life into her characters that I find unparalleled. Just an amazing narrator.,I enjoyed the story and look forward to book 2, which is unfortunately not on Audible yet, so I have ordered a paper copy. But will definitely purchase the audiobook as well when it (hopefully) becomes available just so I can listen to Ms. Dawes do her thing. This is an incredibly slow burn, so be ready for that, but I highly recommend.,I love Lee Winter but this did not rank up there with The Red Files or Breaking Character.  I felt like this book was the set up for Chaos Agent.  There was enough to keep me listening but I felt extremely disappointed.  The book is worth the read (listen) but I feel the rubber meets the road in book 2, at least I hope so!,This book was so much fun to listen to that I couldn‚Äôt stop. I loved the characters and how they made political sabotage lighthearted and fun. Angela Dawe was fantastic as always. So glad I waited for the audio book and not so patiently waiting for the next one,Winter and Dawe‚Ä¶that‚Äôs really all that needs to be explained for a 5 star review. Every story I‚Äôve listened to with this duo is always a win. And now I have to find something to distract me until Chaos Agent comes out in a couple weeks. But another great story from Lee Winter. And an ear soothingly lovely story telling from Angela Dawe. Get this audiobook. You won‚Äôt regret it.,This was just so freaking good. I cannot possible think of any other words to describe it.,Great story only made better by the narration performance. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book!,Expected more from Lee Winter. But the narration really was the only highlight here. The story was just nah..,I really enjoyed the story but it ended so abruptly!! I need a second book ASAP,I LOVED THIS DYNAMIC DUO.  üíØ,Fantastic writing in a great storyline and fantastic narration in a great performance made this audio book brilliant.,The characters and the plot has left me wanting more and more, roll on audio book 2. It was a pure joy to listen to and so clever, witty and just darn good. üòç,,Lee Winter x Angela Dawe = Pure joy! Did not disappoint, looking forward to the next instalment v soon.,Lee Winter and Angela Dawe‚Ä¶perfect combination. Great storyline. Great interpretation. So, so worth it.,Really, it‚Äôs so good! Lee Winter and Angela Dawe are a killer combination. Eden and Michelle have great chemistry. I can‚Äôt wait to listen to next instalment, Villians.,I bought both books in the series the day each was released and had hoped since that an audiobook version comes out soon after. It was a long wait but totally worth it!,Angela Dawe is superb as always! Her voice variety makes each character distinctive, you never get confused of who is talking. Her voice portrayal of Eden Lawless is so on point she made the character more endearing and fun.,I hope the audiobook for the sequel ‚ÄòChaos Agent‚Äô is already in the works and due to be out sooner too.,Lee Winter and Angela Dawe‚Ä¶ always a perfect combo!,More! More!"

Eternal Reign,"Fantasy,Paranormal",Romance,"I am loving this story and really felt like the narration was on point too. I have so many questions and feels üòÇ and can‚Äôt wait to see what happens with them. Amazing job!,Narrator had a way of speaking that drew out the last syllable of words that made me cringe. I sped  up the audio to 1.5 just so I wouldn‚Äôt notice it. I love the sisters books. Read the all. Multiple times. This one just didn‚Äôt do it for me.,I enjoyed the book, overall. However, not a lot happened. This book was more about world building and character introduction. This book also gives you an idea where the story might be heading.,There is quite a bit of violence, in this book, however, there wasn‚Äôt any sexual content, to this point,,Obsessed with this new world! I need the rest out already! Devoured the whole production in a day.,I love a good vampire book! I knew this book had vampire slayers but the fact that they are Viking descendants was such a fun twist!!  I can't wait to see what happens to the twins as this series goes on.  They are definitely on two different paths one with a vampire, one with a slayer it can only lead to a bumpy reunion, because as much as Montana does want to she's going to fall for the vampire!,I hadn‚Äôt read these the first time they were written and I was so excited to read them after being redone. The storyline moves a little slower than I‚Äôm used to with the twisted sisters but still a great read. Narrator did a fantastic job!,,I love the story, the narrator reads the story perfectly, emphasizing the areas that are important,The control of different kind of species to treat the human race so badly. It started out a little slow but got better as it went on. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book.,Like every other series from these authors, I was immediately hooked. The world building is great, throughout the books you‚Äôre getting tidbits of the characters past that really separate Callie from Montana. I‚Äôm anxious how this is all going to play out, if Callie is a Slayer and Montana is turned what does that mean for them? Happy to actually be reading a finished series so I don‚Äôt have to wait on answers!,I absolutely loved the book it is awesome a little slow at first but you really do get hooked!!! Please add the rest of the books it would be awesome!!,I didn't know much about this series of books before listening, I only knew that I enjoyed books from the authors but this was a new world. At first I wasn't completely gripped but a few chapters in I was and started listening at every available moment. I'm now desperate to listen to the rest of the series. This is a vampire story like nothing I've read before, the vampires are in charge! The story does a great job of building the world in a way you can really imagine it being something that could happen. The main characters lack of knowledge of technology etc is well written and really adds to it. There wasn't really any romance in this first book but feel like the scene has been set for the next one! And I can't wait to listen to how it all plays out. The performance was really good but I did find it hard to tell between the 2 sisters and know whose chapter it was from the voice. If you after a new fantasy series that will have you gripped then this is definitely one for you!,Actual review: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,Audio: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,Spice: Tension, but no spice.,This story is amazing. It has everything I could want in a paranormal fantasy. An engaging storyline, captivating characters, great world building, vampires, slayers and fun dialogue. I live for the twin's snark and sarcasm, it's absolutely hilarious. And the tension building between the different love interests... chef's kiss! I love a good slow burn enemies to lovers with tension so high you can feel it.,To me the story is giving Hunger Games vibes, mixed with the Witcher, and some royal courting. I love it! I have really high hopes for this series and I can't wait to read the next book.,The narration was alright. I like her voice and it's easy to tell the difference between Callie and Montana's narration, which is great. And the male voices were pretty good. But the narration didn't flow smoothly as a whole in my opinion, where every other sentence sounded like a dramatic statement. Sped up to x1.5 this wasn't as noticeable and I was able to enjoy the story more.,I loved this series originally when I first delved into the back catalogue of the authors, but the re-released version is truly better! Michelle is a new narrator to me, as she is the sisters stories, but she told this perfectly portraying the difference between the sisters beautifully!,this book contains everything needed from vampires humans and vampire hunters. an amazing start to the series where vampires a,have taken over the human world and become the ultimate Lords of the world.,however what would the world be without strong wild twins who refuse to follow the crowd and want to have a better life.,this is a must read with a great beginning to what is sure to be a other amazing series.,will you change your opinions from the start to the end of the book. beautifully written and read.,,I wasn't lucky enough to read the original version of these books before they were unpublished, so I've been eager to read this since I found out it was being rewritten!,This book is an amazing start to the series! It is amazing at setting up the world that Callie and Montana live in, along with a good insight to the characters.,It started off quite slow, but that's usually the case when world building, and it's book 1 of 6 so totally expected! The last few chapters of the book had me on the edge of my seat needing to know more and I'm so excited for book 2!!,I absolutely love Michelle Sparks as a narrator and loved this audio ‚ù§Ô∏è,Dystopian word. Check. Vampires. Check. Vampire hunters. Check! Human food sources and they are twins! Check! Like what‚Äôs not to love! Great opening to a great story! This has got my mouth watering to lick‚Ä¶ check that thought for later lol but is watering for more! Really frigging enjoyed this and great narrator. If you can‚Äôt tell, I loved it lol,"
The Fellowship of the Ring,"Classics,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"There are a number of Lord of the Rings recordings out there, including a superb dramatization by the BBC. But there is only ONE set of unabridged recordings of the trilogy -- from Recorded Books and read by Rob Inglis. For many years, I've treasured the set of these recordings I have on compact disc. But never before now have I been able to find them for audio download -- until now!!! Words cannot express how thrilled I am to listen to the Lord of the Rings on my iPod (and on my Kindle too!) Audible members who have never yet heard the saga read in its entirety, you are in for a very special treat indeed! In a whole new way will you enjoy the story you've read years ago and have seen transformed into the motion pictures. It'll be almost as if you're experiencing the story for the very first time.,What made the experience of listening to The Fellowship of the Ring the most enjoyable?,The audiobook doesn't let you skip or skim the songs (or the whole Tom Bombadil section); the result is that you experience the book as Tolkien intended it.,What does Rob Inglis bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,Rob Inglis's reading is superb on general principles - he distinguishes characters well and interprets them beautifully.  But the best surprise is the authenticity and quality of his rendering of Tolkien's many songs.  Heroic when that's appropriate; funny or moving or spiritual by turns, this is an effect you can't produce for yourself in a silent reading.  (And Tolkien heard and authorized some of Inglis's tunes.),I have read and re-read the LoTR books many times, and this was my first time listening to them as an audiobook.  I was prepared to be disappointed but was instead very pleasantly surprised.  It seemed to me that the plot moved much faster when listening to the books than when I read them.  In any case, these are among my very favorite, if not my favorite, books ever.  The story is great, but there is so much more to these books than just a great story.  There is a tremendous amount of wisdom that infuses these books.  If you‚Äôve read these books, you know what I mean.  If you haven‚Äôt, you really must read them.  Before I finish, I will say that the narrator is excellent.  He infuses the different characters with personality and full credit to how he handles all the songs.  I found that listening at 1.25x speed was just right.,IT'S DANGEROUS BUSINESS GOING OUT YOUR DOOR.,I read the hard back, I have listened all the way through, and I have given up twice. It is weird when a book so loved, does nothing for you. You wonder, is it me? The quotes from the book are great, I could write down quotes all day. The movie was fantastic. I can't get interested in the characters or the story. It would be sacrilege, I know, but I would love to have this story rewritten by someone who is good at bringing characters to life, such as Robin Hobb or Brandon Sanderson. If your like me and don't like this, don't worry, you are not alone, but you might not want to repeat it or write a review to be read by fanatics.,IT IS SAID ""YOU DO NOT GO TO THE ELVES FOR ADVICE, FOR THE WILL SAY BOTH YES AND NO."",This book marks the beginning of Frodo the Hobbit's quest to resolve the question of the Ring of Power which hangs over the fate of Middle Earth like a menacing cloud. I read this book over 40 years ago and it has headed up (together with the others in the trilogy) my list of books to be stranded on a desert island with ever since.,Although the fantasy genre predates The Lord of the Rings, it is no exaggeration to say that Tolkien's books inspired the tsunami of fantasy fiction which is with us even today. More than once, I have read some particularly dreadful specimen of the same and thought to myself that J.R.R. Tolkien has a lot to answer for (tongue-in-cheek) but his genius speaks for itself and is recognized today. When I was in college, stating that The Lord of the Rings was a great work of fiction elicited (from my English professors) stares of incomprehension from some and mild contempt from others. As Norman Cantor has remarked, however, it is the reading public that determines whether a work is great or not and by that standard The Lord of the Rings is now a classic.,Rob Inglis is able to do the series full justice. Not only is he a superb narrator, but he can sing which is important in a work with such an emphasis on songs and music (not always the case.. sometimes I've cringed in sympathetic embarrassment as a narrator, competent in other respects, attempted to sing or chant his/her way through a song with dismal results).,In short, you can't go wrong with this series, particularly if you like stories about quests or knightly adventures. There's very little in the way of boy-girl romance however and no sex so readers who like plenty of that in their fiction may want to look elsewhere.,The last time I ""read"" The Fellowship of the Ring, I read it out loud to my daughter at bed time. Took several months, reading a handful of pages each night. That was about a dozen years ago. Prior to that, I read the entire trilogy about a dozen times, but that was back in my youth in the 60s and 70s, when I re-read it every summer (yeah, yeah, go ahead and mock me, I'd do the same). So no surprise that I jumped at listening to the audiobook when I got the chance.,,So who are you and what can I tell you about Tolkien's classic fantasy trilogy? Chances are, you already know all about The Lord of the Rings, in which case there's not much I can add other than critique the narration (see below). If you've never heard of LOTR, you've either been living under a rock for the past half century, or you're too young to read, in which case, all I can say is, READ IT (as soon as you can get out from under your rock, or when you're old enough to read big boy books).,,Perhaps you've seen the movie trilogy and are wondering whether it's worth your time to read (listen to) the books, no small consideration given the total length of The Hobbit and LOTR tops 65 hours. I would strongly recommend that you at least read The Fellowship. I always loved it the best because it takes place at more of a, uh, I can't say human level because they're mostly not human, but you get more of a feel for individual characters and specific settings, the remaining books operating on a more epic scale.,,And a lot of that character development and scene/mood setting occurs in passages (entire chapters, actually) left out of the movie. The film version of The Hobbit, a trilogy, contains far more material than the book (including some sections originally in The Fellowship). The movie versions of The Two Towers and The Return of the King may be structured in a different manner than the books, but the events are pretty much all there.,,By contrast, there are substantial portions of The Fellowship completely omitted by the movie, including four consecutive chapters in Book 1 along with most of a fifth -- when the hobbits approach Buckland with the Black Riders in pursuit, meet Old Man Willow and Tom Bombadil in the Old Forest, and encounter the barrow-wight on the Barrow Downs. To keep the movie length manageable, it was determined that these adventures did not further the story of the ring. I don't disagree with the decision, despite my disappointment especially with the loss of the magical Tom Bombadil and his companion Goldberry.,,Here then is your main reason to read The Fellowship if you've only seen the movie. There are also major scenes omitted from the fellowship's journey through Moria, Lothlorien, and down the Anduin from Book 2, as well as major passages of lore from The Council of Elrond and other similar discussions. And then there are the many Tolkien songs sung a capella by narrator Rob Inglis to tunes he and his producer wrote. Personally, I found the songs tedious and the recording (done a quarter century ago) crude by today's audiobook standards, so I took a star off Inglis's otherwise legendary recitation.,,For Tolkien fans looking for a new way to enjoy his best work, or for others willing or desiring to see what the fuss is all about, this audiobook is a perfect way to follow the adventures of Frodo and his hobbit friends as they make their way across the Shire, through the Old Forest to Bree, on to the magical valley of Rivendell, into the mines of Moria and the enchanated woodland of Lothlorien, and down the Great River toward Gondor and Mordor, along the way meeting Tolkien's version of wizards, elves, dwarves, trolls, wraiths, wights, orcs, balrogs, wargs, and all sorts of men, strange, heroic, devious, and jolly.,Would you listen to The Fellowship of the Ring again? Why?,Yes, for sure. It was just a pleasure to listen to it. The narrator made it so captivating... Even though the book is of course from The Lord of The Rings series and wouldn't need further reasons to listen to.,What was one of the most memorable moments of The Fellowship of the Ring?,Surprisingly the songs. I loved that the narrator managed to put into melody the songs on the book and actually sing them.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Rob Inglis ‚Äì was your favorite?,Elrond. Perhaps because of the contrast with the Elrond from the movies. Rob's voice for this character was lighter and melodious.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,If I could, I would, but it's a bit too long for me to listen in one sitting :),Middle Earth is a fantastic world to get lost in and I loved all the time spent with world-building.  What I didn't like is how longwinded the poems are. You have forgotten you are listening to the book, you've become one of the fellowship, then suddenly you realize that Gandolf has been reciting the same sonnet for, what feels like, the last million years. Tolkien must have been a talker because most of his characters can't shut up. It's a wonder that Sauron needed spies because the Fellowship is LOUD!,Well, first, I would like to both thank Audible for finally making this available, and alternately curse them for doing so at a time when they're making so many other great books available (Gardens of the Moon, for one).  Needless to say, all others will have to wait until I'm done listening to these.,Second, I have to admit that I've just started listening to it, but so far, I must say that I'm entirely impressed by Mr. Inglis' reading.  Nice, clear voice, good differentiation of the different characters.,Third, like many others, I read ""The Hobbit"" and this trilogy as a pre-teenager about 30 years ago.  I loved it.  I honestly don't think you can consider yourself a fantasy fan if you haven't read these books.  They are, simply put, amazing.  I eagerly watched all the movies and was very impressed with those as well.  Except for ""The Hobbit"", of course.  Now, I finally have a chance to listen to them in audio, and unabridged!,Again, thank you Audible... now, if you could just get ""Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn"" by Tad Williams, I'd be even happier!,Inglis ‚Äòs reading of the fellowship of the ring and the rest of the lord of the rings is classic. Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt miss it!,Outstanding,Worth listening again and again,~~~~~~~~~,(Though @RecordedBooks:,How about a new edition featuring someone with a singing voice that is listenable?,And editing it in to this audio?,The text features several songs,,However each time a song comes up, I reach as fast as I can for ‚Äúfast forward‚Äù).,This aside, it‚Äôs one of the books on Audible I enjoy the most. Thanks.,This may be my favourite book, and the narrator is wonderful, even though some of his choices are not as I would have read them, but it's only a minor nitpick. If you've only‚Äã ever seen the movie, do yourself a favour and pick up this audiobook now."

Alice always writes great books.,Narrator was good too. The story has a great twist to it.,,Another fantastic and hilarious book by Alice Winters!  I love every everything about this book.

I can‚Äôt wait for the next book!,This whole thing was a joy to read, then listen to. I love it all, but I love more than anything, how far Alice has come as a writer.

On a Night Like This,,,"Oh wow, what a great little book!!! I laughed so hard at times and the story kept a smile on my face the whole read. I was kind of mad at Sarah in book 2 for breaking poor Elliott's heart but I guess it just wasn't his time for true live until he met Cher. These 3 had the best chemistry of the 3 couples. The imagery for the apartment and dates was so unique. These two ""got"" each other.

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"It is (as you can already tell by the title) the US variation of the book, with all the oddness that comes with it but it mostly cames out unscathed.,I've heard the UK audiobook before, however, and while Jim Dale comes close, Stephen Fry is the better narrator so I'm doubly annoyed that we don't have the option to buy the Philosopher's Stone version.,Other than not having Fry as narrator and not using the English verbiage it is a classic. Listening to it after so long is like seeing an old friend.,Will likely re listen to entire series have not read them in ages!,***Listeners should have the option to choose the narrator! ****,If you could sum up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1 in three words, what would they be?,A. MA.ZING.,Have you listened to any of Jim Dale‚Äôs other performances before? How does this one compare?,Excellent. If you like this, I recommend his reading of the Books of Beginning Series. This first is the Emerald Atlas. I will say that on the first listen I did not like the portrayal of Hermione. She seemed a little whiny. But I persevered, and now that I am used to it, I am glad I stuck it out.,Any additional comments?,I have listened to these over and over, checking them out from my local library. I have an hour commute each way to and from work, and I have listened to these so many times. I also listen to them at night as I fall alseep to Jim Dale's calm voice. I always wanted to own them, but I just could not afford the price on Pottermore. I don't know what prompted the shift, but I am eternally grateful. This has made my day, my week, my month, and quite possibly my whole year.,Would you consider the audio edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1 to be better than the print version?,Wow, that's hard.  There is, as there always is for me, so much enjoyment in reading for myself with my own timing, like stopping to imagine a scene, re-reading something that made me laugh, etc.  But after having read the book, I really enjoyed listening to it.,What about Jim Dale‚Äôs performance did you like?,His performance matched pretty closely the way I would have read the book out loud to myself, and you can't ask for more than that!,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,It would just be silly to binge listen to such a huge and amazing (magical) story.  Enjoy it!,‚ÄúIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.‚Äù,The great thing about growing up and eventually watching your own kids start to grow is sharing the magic of reading. I'm a total snob about my books. I rarely venture into YA Fiction or Fantasy, but I still remember introducing my wife, my sisters-in-law, etc., to Harry Potter.  We devoured the first three books. And as every subsequent book came out, we were first in line, often reading thorough the night to finish and discuss. Our family has already listened to Jim Dale's epic read of the Potter series on CD on multiple family car trips.,I'm not sure what motivated J.K. Rowling to move from Pottermore to Audible, but as a rabid Potter family and an Audible fanatic, I'm glad she finally did.,I love Harry Potter, but I wish Americans could order Fry's version of the audiobooks rather than Jim Dale's. I first encountered Jim Dale in another series and absolutely hated the way he voiced girls and women - and two of the three main characters were female. He was so bad, I researched a bit to find out why this fun, promising book (The Emerald Atlas, btw) had such a terrible reader and was very surprised to learn he had won awards for Harry Potter! It took me quite a while to resign myself to get these audiobooks. Rowling never disappoints, but Dale is another thing altogether. He is quite good with most of the voices, but Hermoine's is so terrible, it has shades of sexism. I'm not calling him sexist, but he's just that bad.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,Stephen Fry reading it. Jim Dale makes everyone sound so whiny and awful, including Harry. It is unbearable.,Any additional comments?,Please add Stephen Fry's reading. It is so much better than the Jim Dale version.,I read each Potter book with huge enjoyment within days of the publication of each.,I listened to the Potter series years ago when they first came out on CD. These wonderful stories are done full justice by Jim Dale, whose narration compliments Rowling's lovely characters perfectly. I am so delighted that Rowling has finally allowed the digital versions to be sold on Audible as the cost of them through her website was ridiculous.,At any rate, if you have not listened to Harry Potter - even if you've read it and seen the films - you will be introduced to Harry, Ron, Hermione and all the denizens of Hogwarts in a different way when you listen to The Sorcerer's Stone.,I can't seen any point in recapping the plot because I just assume everyone has read at least the first two of these books, but I can tell you that listening to them is an ""immersive"" experience. Of course, that's true of any book, but the richness of Rowling's characters, settings and situations are brought to life, in my opinion, in an entirely different way when you listen to Jim Dale read them to you.,If  you already love and appreciate the Harry Potter series, you'll rediscover it when you listen. If you have NOT yet read any Harry Potter... my condolences. If you listen, you may discover what you missed!,I love the Harry Potter series but Please give us Stephen fry version! It‚Äôs so much better!!,,WE COULD HAVE GOT KILLED OR WORSE, EXPELLED,A book that gets kids and parents to read has to be admired. In my life time, I have never seen a book or series of books cause so much excitement. That alone is worth Hooting about. I think the book works mostly because of Rowling's imagination. Flying keys, dock 9 and three quarters, talking hats, unicorns, Fluffy, the school itself, moving and talking chess pieces, moving pictures, and on and on. The characters are also lovable. Who-who could not love Harry. Harry is a modern day Cinderella, who becomes a humble Superman. The story has lots of action. It is just a fun read.,HARRY WISHED HE HAD ABOUT EIGHT MORE EYES,I liked the book on a personal level, but I did not love it. As an eight or ten year old, I am sure I would have loved it. As an adult I see things, I would not have as a child. This is where my honesty gets me into trouble, but I had some issues. Two or three times someone is called fat and than the good guys, call them pigs and that is suppose to be funny. It is not just the mean kid, but also a picture of a fat woman. Harry should be punished for flying on a broom when he was told he would be expelled if he did, but because he is so good, he gets special treatment. Kind of like giving the football star, a pass on his behavior in school because he is important to the team. This is also another book, where the main character is great because of his birth right. He does not work hard to achieve these powers. Matter of fact the character who works the hardest is put down and has no friends. I know later in the series she takes a more important role, but if all you read is this one book, what message does this send to kids? One more small thing, I can't believe a kid from a large family, does not know how to make his own sandwich.,IT'S SECRET, SO OF COURSE THE WHOLE SCHOOL KNOWS,This mixture of Cinderella, Star Wars and Superman is an entertaining  read. There are no dull spots. Rowling fills the book with her imagination, which is broad. It is a must read for people of all ages."
Greenlights,"Entertainment & Celebrities,Personal Success,Self Help",Biographies & Memoirs,"I am not necessarily fanatical about this actor, but I can say now with conviction I am fanatical about this author.  I found Matthew so honest, witty, intelligent,  articulate, compassionate, brave, loyal, etc.  His impersonation skills are spot on.  I listened to all 6+ hours in one day (from my not feeling well bed)...so entertaining!  In my opinion, Matthew McConaughey is an incredible role model for a human being.  Thank you Matthew!,MM is a talented actor, a dedicated family man & a heck of a good writer & narrator.   I had no problem listening to that sexy voice of his for hours.  He‚Äôs just so darn  like-able & sincere.  I felt like we were hanging out (sans bongos) & Matthew was personally telling me these great stories of his life, work & family.  Matthew shared very private memories he recorded in journals he began as a young kid with sincerity & honesty.  He is an unbelievably talented writer!  I‚Äôve seen all of his movies & have been a big fan for years.  I always wondered what he was really life.  Now I feel like I almost know him.   His storytelling is that intimate. This is  an enjoyable & surprisingly open & honest book.  The fact that MM narrated it himself really brought his stories to life & was the icing on the cake.  This is a fantastic break out book.    True fans of Matthew are going to love this.  I LOVED THIS.   Well worth the credit & your time.  I hope this is helpful.,This book will be finished by lunch time.,Matthew M. is one of the most talented people in Hollywood. It‚Äôs one of those moments when you knew you loved the man, but now you love him even more. Thank you for sharing your stories.,*spoiler alert* I overall enjoyed this book. However, the beginning to middle was the best part. Arrogance snuck in from time to time, in various places. With that being said, I still admire his authenticity.,Couldn‚Äôt stop listening (it‚Äôs good that he‚Äôs got a melodic voice) This is a book I will listen to more than once. I just started a journal to see what my future self will be reminded of. Favorite part was hearing the story of how he got the roll in ‚ÄúA Time to Kill‚Äù,Well told and solid gold.  Stories that will make you giggle and ponder and rewind while saying, ‚Äòhold up did he just say...?‚Äô.  So chock full of wisdom and good bumper sticker sayings that I think I might like to buy the book to have it written down somewhere to better reference.,Shockingly, ridiculously, idiotic, self importance. So much more douchey than I could have ever imagined. Pretty angry I paid for this,  I really thought he might not be the guy we all saw in those Lincoln commercials.,Anyway, he tried and that‚Äôs all that counts.,Matthew McConaughey is a fabulous story teller.  I could listen to his voice and his stories for days on end.  He is a very talented, witty and intelligent man.  I love his positive outlook and I enjoyed learning about his life.,Have Matthew McConaughey write it. He has zero talent for writing even though he has kept a journal for years.,If you want a good bio try Rob Lowes Stories I Only Tell My Friends: An Autobiography.,‚Ä¶ That is the only person I would refer this to. If you were a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey you will probably enjoy this book very much.  I listen to this audiobook because of the great reviews it had and because I‚Äôm a fan, not a huge fan but definitely a fan. I was skeptical Matthew McConaughey could write a book that would interest me. I enjoyed the first 20% of it. I loved that he narrated the book and felt that brought personal connection to the experience. I am beyond impressed at his writing skills. However, he is also incredibly impressed with his writing skills and it ultimately becomes exhausting to listen to. Combined with the fact that it is six hours of listening to how amazing his life is and was. And it was amazing. Almost fairytale like. It seems to be a platform for him to brag about himself under the guise of offering enlightenment or maybe importation to others. I just took it as bragging. And he has an awful lot to brag about. He describes an unbelievably charmed life and good for him. I have always been I will continue to be a fan of his work on the screen. I think he is completely enjoyable and captivating to watch. But this book, Nothing captivating about it, more of a turn off.,You‚Äôll love the one liners, two liners and the whole bloody book! Do it, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
A Storm of Swords,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The story and narration are excellent, but is it too much to ask for the audio book to be constructed properly? The chapter breaks do not align with the actual chapters and the parts will end in the middle of a paragraph.  Very sloppy and unprofessional.  For a $50 audiobook I would expect more.,This review contains comments on Books 3 and 4 of the Ice and FIre series.,Dear Ice and Fire Junkie,The popularity of the HBO series, Game of Thrones has enticed many folks to pick up and start plowing through the entire series of tomes from which the TV shows derive their inspiration. And, once you‚Äôre sucked in, it‚Äôs pretty much like quicksand. The brilliant acting of most, if not all, of the characters along with the masterful writing of their roles and place in this Tolkienesque saga makes us easy prey for this quagmire. But beware good reader, there is much more to this sticky wicket than a mere addiction.,Before you get too heavily invested in this series, if you haven‚Äôt already, you owe it to yourself to pay attention to the negative reviews of Books 4 and 5. Among those reviews, the breakdown in narration after Book 3 is particularly egregious. I am generally a fan of Roy Dotrice. He is not my favorite narrator / performer but he is unquestionably a very good one but mostly for playing the roles of older men. The characters of young men seem to present Mr. Dotrice with something of a challenge and that of female characters, especially young ones, a challenge that is unsurmountable. That being said, Mr. Dotrice‚Äôs contribution to the powerful and stunningly produced first three books in this series was not insignificant. There were parts in the writing of those that seemed to drag on and on too long but they were still made entertaining by the narrator. In Books 4 and 5 there were many more dull, uninspired passages that were also made less entertaining by the narrator.,And, that being said, what in the heck is up with the changes in pronunciation of names and the voices of their owners?  Was anyone paying attention to the editing and production of these last two books? I don‚Äôt know if it was Random House Audio or Audible who dropped the ball here but it all starts with Roy Dotrice. He‚Äôs the common denominator here and has to be aware of this huge distracting shift that took place between books and has to have the most responsibility for better quality control.,As far as the story goes, I will repeat here some of what I wrote in a review of Book 1. While I loved a lot about the writing in the first installment, I cared so much about the characters, to have so many of these good and honorable protagonists tortured and killed, I thought that I did not need to continue beyond Book 1. But, continue I did and was not sorry after Book 2. I enjoyed the third installment but things slid downhill in all respects after that. There are characters that I am still interested in and wish to know about their fates, even a couple of the villains. But, will I invest 2 more credits in this series? Me thinks not, at least not at this time. It is not That great.,Oh, and lest I not forget, the ending. Book 4 contains the very worst ending of any book I have ever picked up. If an author lacks so much imagination that s/he cannot satisfyingly end a book even if it is not the last in a series then me thinks the author's imagination needs work. I believe that authors owe it to their readers to finish a book and not just entice their readers to buy the next installment. Shame on you GRRM. Book 3 was an excellent book. It left many unanswered questions but at least had a decent conclusion. And, dear reader, you may wish to just end your addiction with Book 3. It's all downhill from there.,I had a very hard time turning this one off...  I'd find extra house-work to do or look for traffic jams on the way to work just so I could keep listening.,,The narrator, Roy Dotrice, is fantastic.,,The characters in this book are amazing...  We see the bad parts of the good guys, and the good parts of the bad.  We get an understanding of what motivates both, and it's not always what we think.  And, just as in the first two, G.R.R.M. has no problems setting people up with opportunities to win or escape or get out of whatever mess they're in...sometimes they get out, sometimes they die - no matter how important a character they've been...,,This is not a kids book.  This is not the usual ""you are special and need to save the world"" drivel with hollywood happy endings we usually feed on...  This one is more...real.,,The story keeps moving, plenty of action, laugh-out-loud funny parts, hardship, and surprises.,,Anyone who says G.R.R.M. was only trying to make the book long, probaby wasn't paying attention.,,,As I sat and listened to the book I found myself once again at the edge of my seat almost. The book seemed to be moving too slowly and yet too fast as I read it. Too slow in that you get impatient wondering what is going to happen next yet everything seemed so relevant and then too fast in terms of when you do reach the end you are left pining for more.,George R. R. Martin did a superlative job with every character in the book. This particular book has one of the most startling twists yet, one of those twists that make you think ""What the?!?!"" I remember listening what happened and for a VERY VERY long time wondering ""Did that really happen?"". He spares no one in these books I find and I have now come to expect the unexpected.,Roy Dotrice.... What can I say? There is little I can say about his performance except this... just plain exceptional.,Would you try another book from George R. R. Martin and/or Roy Dotrice?,Read this book because it's good, but the performance by Roy Dotrice can often times be so mush-mouthed and affected, it makes many of the characters he portrays completely unintelligible. Sadly, we only have his performance to listen to.,How could the performance have been better?,I wish the narrator put a lot less Cockney in his characterizations.,I just finished this book, the third in the series and it was the best 40+ hours of audio book I've ever listened to.  I have listens to well over a hundred audio books and all 3 of these books stand out as the very best.  110 hours and I could do it all over again.  I will wait and check each day until the next book to ready.  Powerful fantasy written for adults.,Now I know there have been so many reviews that I hesitate to add one. I just wish to say I enjoyed these books tremendously. This one is the third of the series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", whose title takes more and more ominous tones as the story unfolds.  The first two books were ""A Game of Thrones"" and ""A Clash of Kings"", and although I haven't written a review of those, I agree with all those who raved for the book.  I loved them all. How else could you listen to this third volume (38 hrs?!?)  So I assume I am preaching to the choir here. If by any chance, you haven't listened to the first two, you really need to start with GoT (as the first volume is called amongst fans). Absolutely.,,For the fans, I just wish to say that the fourth installment comes in November. I've already asked Audible when they plan to provide the audio version. I find these books more immensely enjoyable in audio form, although I recently bought the paperbacks as a reference, esp. when the fourth volume comes out.  It'll be handy, and more easily browsable than an audio version.,,So there. If you don't know where the web site is, and would like to read the announcement from the author himself, google it or go to georgerrmartin.com.  In a previous page (now defunct, I wonder why) he explained that his choice for ""A Feast for Crows"", as the fourth tome is going to be named, is to take apart the book he'd be writing and only keep the part about the Seven Kingdoms (yeah! my favorite!)  The part about Daenerys and the Isles is going to go into the next installments. This way he'll be able to finish the fourth in time, and in fact it makes more sense to him. And to me too: it was a bit irritating to jump back and fourth between the two continents in two stories which we knew wouldn't come together till much later in the story (perhaps not even in the next two volumes).,,For those of you feel same, my favorite character is Arya. Can't wait to hear her story. Yeah!,This review is short, and winter is coming. Quck summary, here is a tasty in less than 1/2 minute: Swords, sex, incest, ships, war, slaves, maidens, maidenhead (no not that town in Berkshire, England), night, knights, dragons, draegans, a dwarf, dire-wolves, the cold, war, sex, fire, ice, crows (crows, crows, crows), snow, Snow, whores, weddings and more sex.,Roy Doltrice does a good job with the narration of a long book, but he seems to only have four voices: King/knight and low-born man; high-born woman and whore. It is like a barratone choir with only four notes. Great notes, rich notes, but only four. That makes it difficult when the audiobook has more flaming swords than voices. That being said, didn't Bono say once that all one needed to be great was three chords and the truth. I guess, then, this narration has the truth + 1.,So many positive comments on the narration I was surprised. Yes, the man is talented and can do lots of accents. But why would different family members who've always lived together have different accents? Insanity. Why is Mance Rayder made to sound like a silly old man? Tywin Lannister sounds like a Winston Churchill imitation and don't get me started on the horrible, offensive chinese-esque accent for Missandei used even when she's speaking in her more familiar language and shouldn't have much of an accent. Generally, the accents and reading made me nuts, but the book is so good I couldn't stop listening.  Big books like these need a good producer to track accents and pronunciation, so I don't necessarily blame the poor old narrator. The reviews of the reader of the next book aren't encouraging but I for one am ready for a break from this nonsense. Without a different production team, what are the chances it will be any better?,The background and setting is incredible, Martin's writing is excellent, and the narration is some of the best I have heard. However I am finding this the most depressing and frustrating fantasy series that I have ever read. It is depressing because nothing good ever happens in this world. It is frustrating because of Martin's habit of killing off main characters. Readers feel cheated when the characters they have invested time and emotion into suddenly die. It is a faux pas that authors avoid, and I can see why. I got halfway through this book and I lost interest because the protagonists keep disappearing. I don't feel like wasting time on another character who will surely die in another few chapters."
Book of the Dead 2: Sacrifice,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Like my review of the first book, I don't have much to say. This series is an in depth exploration of the mechanics of necromancy and the mentality of the main character, both of which are concepts I thoroughly enjoy. The execution is good, the characters feel real, and there isn't much plot armor to speak of. I'm enjoying where the story is going, and Phil Thron is doing an excellent job with the narration. Quality and content wise, it's pretty much unchanged from book one, which is a good thing as that book was quite well made. I will definitely be coming back for book three.,,The Three and The Court make my eye twitch every time they pull their strings of Tyron, but I think that's intentional. Arrogant a-holes.,,I fully recommend.,Everything in the story has been masterfully written and delivered--a true pleasure. The only downside is the fact that the many other LitRPGs I listen to between RinoZ's releases are beginning to look more and more sophomoric in comparison.,Nope. Hey, you, please buy this book.,Please. This is worth it. This is a masterpiece.,Adventure, progression, drama, humor.,Please. We need this guy to keep writing.,Well written and read, worth every penny! The characters transformation towards the end felt right for the situation.,can't wait for the next in the series.  this continuation is a great read. i couldn't stop listening to it,The ending was bittersweet in the best possible way. Already dying for the next part. Bravo RinoZ, beautifully done.,much like the first book this was a great book and couldn't if asked for a better follow up, and now I have to wait for the next one.,I'm roughly a third of the way through and I'm *really* struggling with this.,There's only so much moralising and self-depricating I can take. The author hasn't even gone about it in a clever of sympathetic way either.,When you have your protagonist empathizing with literal rapists and murderers of innocents, you're not being as deep as you think you are. It turns me against the protagonist, and it makes me dislike him more, because I know what's to come. I know I'm in for more hours of whiney moralising.,The main reason it doesn't work is the author is bringing in real life morals into this fantasy world, and they do NOT apply. Not even a little. This world and ours are completely different, the circumstances incompatible for tracking these themes.,Having said that, even if it *weren't*, I'd still not sympathize with the protagonist whining about killing the literal scum of the Earth. Men who roam around the countryside killing, raping and enslaving innocents.,With every whiney protestation, every timid denial, I just dislike him more.,ESPECIALLY SINCE WHAT HE DID TO DOVE IS ARGUABLY WAY WORSE.,This is why I'm struggling. The protagonist isn't really showing any growth either. He's doing what needs to be done, but the whining is just getting worse. It's a choir to listen to.,I don't know if I'll finish.,The main character has less people to interact with on a regular basis now than he did before. The mom and dad thing was very predictable based on the title and moments leading up to it, but it was very interesting and redeeming in a way. It‚Äôs nice to see the book get mentioned at the end. It seems like it was solely for ripping blank pages out. I do look forward to more of this story.,once again rinoz wrote another knock out. picks right up as our favorite necromancer continues his growth.,while I do hope their adventures continue, but did have a good ending so if not.,I definitely recommend this series,Great story, really glad I stumbled upon this series. I would recommend to any fan of litrpg,This book gave everything you would want in the next instalment. Got to see a bit more of the world lore and can‚Äôt wait to see where we are taken next.,I liked the first a lot, and I am happy to say the 2nd is just as good if not better. Can't wait for the next.,loved every second of it, I hope there is a book 3 but if not I happy where it has ended"
Ensnared,"Literature & Fiction,Post-Apocalyptic",Erotica,"Book one of a series be warned and ready that this one ends on a cliffhanger. Book 2 is slated for a January 2024 release with my fingers crossed that the audio comes soon after. But don't wait or sleep, this is totally worth hanging on the cliff, just do it.,,I honestly don't know how to review this book I don't want to spoil anything, but I also want you to know that it's so amazing! It was addictive. I didn't want to stop listening to the audiobook from the first chapter.,,It's post apocalyptic which was totally my jam for YA books. Then grow it up and take it to the next level with a found family community that is not only a home and safe haven, but also contains 5 guys that all have different personalities, needs and desires (that will revolve around her). She makes a pact for protection, a deal that allows her to live in this sanctuary, as long as she lets them each have time with her. *fans self* But it becomes so much more than a sex pact. Each of the men find a way into her heart and awakens desires she didn't know she had, made her willing to experiment in ways she'd never dreamed of before. Until the reality of the world outside their fences comes crashing back in.,,The audiobook is performed by a full cast of narrator legends and they each bring a ton of performance power to the telling of this story. I swear there must be something woven into the words, some hypnosis worked in behind the performances because this book was utterly addictive and I want to just start it all over again and again and again until book 2 comes out.,,Avery Caris - Eden, the lone female, former librarian with a history of being put in a place/role defined by others. She wants to live free and make choices.,,Sebastian York - Dom, the leader of the squad of former army rangers. He's been burned by women before and that history is colouring his view of Eden and what she could bring to the group dynamic. SebYo as the Alphahole leader, yes please! The voice and dynamic from him is absolutely perfect.,,Joe Arden - Beau, medic/doctor, also burned by the past as he used to share submissives with Dom and would love to again if they could ever get over their issues. We get some southern drawl from Joe in this one. The warm melted butter and honey styling of this man trying to tempt Eden into trying to join them. His praise of her made me melt, his anger and frustration with Dom was palpable, the two of them together are those bickering besties that make you laugh to watch. But once things get serious, watch out.,,Jason Clarke - Jaykob, mechanic of the team, rough around the edges, a loner. He's very aggressive and demanding. He knows what he wants and takes it when it's offered. He's a little scary but I'm looking forward to seeing more of his inner workings come out as the series unfolds. Jason is pure fire portraying this grumpy grouchy jerk of a man.,,JF Harding - Lucky, former circus performer, prankster and charmer, total golden retriever energy. He wants to make Eden laugh and smile. But he also has dreams and wishes for them both to kneel at someone else's feet together. The light and buoyant feel of Lucky was refreshing among all the aggressive males. Lucky's internal feelings just break your heart as he longs for someone that doesn't want him (or so he thinks). I adore JF and his performance made me smile and swoon, made me tear up and despair. I think Lucky is my fave at this point and I want more more more.,,Teddy Hamilton - Jasper, psychologist, sadist, uptight and stern. Jasper is battling so much in side himself, what he wants vs. what he thinks is ""right"" and ""proper"". It's so hard to watch him deny himself. Listening to Teddy in this role was a treat. I'm used to light fun Teddy and to get stern emotionally tormented Jasper was like melting the richest darkest chocolate on my tongue.,,I requested and was provided with an advance copy of the audiobook. These are my honest opinions.,I knew when I pre-ordered this book, that it was going to be different. Well, I want the second book üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôve listened to audible books for more than 3 years and never wrote a review. I guess there is a first for every thing.,Never have I ever get anxious while listening to a book whooo!!!. I literally had to hit the pose button to cool off and get some air.,YOU NAME IT, IT GOTüòÇüòÖ‚ò∫Ô∏èüò≥üò©üî•,Rebecca Quinn well done and thank you.,Narrators thank you for bringing this book to life.,Y‚Äôall deserve all the flowers üíê ü•Ä,I liked this book! it was fast paced. I count stop listening to it. It ends on a cliff hanger, tho! urg,Oh my word this book was so good and the multicast of narrators totally killed it.  The emotions were raw and the spice was nice.  Can‚Äôt wait for the next book in this series!,This story kept me engaged, The delopment of the characters was rich and intense. The narrators in this multicast were si good!,talk about coming out of the gate hot! My girl bad at this thing straight out of the park! What a great book. It was engaging, exciting, with a well thought out original plot that hasn‚Äôt been done to death, it had enough smexy to keep me reading (without all of the gosh damn ""will she/won't she/I should/but I can't"" angsty bologna that makes me want to rip my hair out), and it was very well written with likeable characters.,just an all-around great first book. Well done!,(I really wish the 2nd book was out now..and released in audio too. I'm a bad wait around-er..),Waste of a credit. Unless you're a fan of 1-dimensional characters, manufactured drama and misogyny, skip this one. I really wish authors would stop pumping out garbage like this, but it's my fault for not listening to a preview or I would have realized I couldn't go 3 minutes without rolling my eyes!,It's not quirky or cute for a FMC to ogle their aggressor when they're terrified and fleeing. It's so cliche and tacky just stop. A FMC that's so meek she has no qualms with unsolicited touching, being invalidated, or otherwise treated like a child with no agency- gross. It's even worse when there is no character growth, only a shift towards taking on all the characteristics the males around her project onto her.,P.S.  It's not even good smut!!! It's all so cringy I couldn't even enjoy that part. sigh.,You need it. You should listen to this and then listen to it again because WHEW it was so good. I can't wait for more from Rebecca Quinn.,,I feel like this was hunger games rewritten for my smut loving morally grey obsessed self. If that doesn't drag you in I'm not sure what willü§£,,,,I hope all the books continue with the same narration. That was a fun ride! So good. I loved every character and the story was good too,This story hit the ground running, and I was here for every step of the ride! Eden was a good FMC that genuinely created a connection with each guy, even if they were reluctant at first. I knew this was going to end on a cliffhanger, but it wasn't the kind that made me mad, but instead left me wanting to snag book 2 as soon as it comes out to see what happens next! The üå∂üå∂ kicked off early on, but never felt like I was getting it in place of plot so I was happy. The voice acting was SUPERB! Each actor made their character their own, and I loved the different view points as the story was told.,I read this book earlier in the year and enjoyed it but the talent in this production just pushes it to another level.  I prefer duet narration on the whole but after hearing this as a full cast production I think there is no going back!  All the elements I enjoyed about the book were heightened; in particular the angst between two of the characters works so well as a back and forth narration in their scenes and just adds so much depth as did the drama in some of the final scenes.,,It was definitely a different experience for me as I knew the plot going in and had my clear favourite MMC.  I was completely won over by the performances in this of some of the characters and just saw them in such a different light. Jayk (Jason Clarke) made me laugh in this, Jasper (Teddy Hamilton) was so much more than the icy persona he portrays and Beau (Joe Arden), just wow.  That character was made to be listened to!  Dom's (Sebastian York) protectiveness just shone through over his stubbornness and Lucky (JF Harding) is even sweeter as is Eden (Avery Caris).  There is suspense, spice and humour (there are some genuinely funny moments in this) and I just loved every minute of it.,,My interpretation of the star system;,3 stars - I enjoyed it; would read the author again,4 stars - I really liked it; I am invested and definitely want more from this author/series,5 stars - I loved it; I engaged with this book completely and I have added all the authors works to my TBR,,,It was an amazing experience having a full cast, the voices were all different, yet they blended perfectly. The story was interesting, fast paced with this gritty cliffhanger. I liked all the characters, they created a tight family with problems and drama, and I'm really looking forward to see what the future holds for them all.,This book had me gripped from the first chapter.  The story, the character growth.. all of it.  I encourage you all to get this book in your ears and let the impressive cast whisk you away.,Loved this book, cant wait for the next instalment and what a cast, definitely a 5 star rating,This book did cover most bases and I was happy about that. Unfortunately I did find myself from time to time rolling my eyes as the descriptions did feel slightly second hand and not completely accurate even with this minor disagreement I couldn't put the book down. I'm completely invested and I can't wait to dive back into their world next year.,Thank you (NOT). For only further intensifying my unhealthy Joe Arden obsession!,The story is far fetched‚Ä¶.. but the best and hottest often are!,Quinn‚Äôs ability to put us in each of the heartthrobs minds and share their pains and pleasures helped me get through this in one single sitting smiling and blushing at my phone üòÇ,This is QUITE the aural experience listening to this book. Dark Romance is always going to be quite immersive and emotionally charged but the whole concept of this story set in a near future post apocolyptic world where civilization has all but collapsed and people are back to their primitive survival mode...well that's a whole new level.,,But then you take that one further by making it a Dom/Sub Reverse Harem with a FULL CAST audio....now you are talking my language.  I was NOT disappointed.,,The story and writing are brilliant, very evocative and slightly chilling in some places, as is apt for the world she has created but I never found it so overwhelming that it makes it unreadable. Far from it, Rebecca Quinn has created a wonderful relatable central character in our lovely ex librarian solo survivor Eden, played to perfection by the wonderul Avery Caris. You are guided through this world where she has seen the very worst of humanity but somewhere managed to survive on her own through her ingenuity and resourcefulness.  Through the course of the novel her character arc is truly delightful to watch as she navigates the self confidence issues and insecurities of her old life and the very present dangers of the new one and still explore her own needs and relationship with the five strangers she now finds herself with.,,Speaking of which, you are offered an absolute feast when it comes to the five mysterious strangers who she now finds herself with.  We have the stoic and fierce protector Captain played by the dominant Sebastian York, the charismatic Southern Doctor by a seductive Joe Arden, the calculating, sadistic and hauntingly beautiful psychologist from a smooth Teddy Hamilton, a brooding, surly and angry loner from the resonate rumbles of Jason Clarke and finally the mischievous and sweet but also cute as hell soldier from the one and only JF Harding.,,I said before, JF Harding STEALS all the scenes he is in in this book, and that is saying something. I mean you see who else is in this right?! They are all exceptional and its like listening to a tense emotional 13 hour film its so good. But J.F Harding totally owns this book if you ask me.  He plays the adorable Lucky aka Lucien who is the youngest of the group and a ray of sunshine, so cheeky you can't help but love him but he also has a vulnerable side and that is when J.F Harding can just come in and clean up and steal everyone's hearts.  His performance is truly breathtaking.  He is effortlessly funny when called for, can break out his smouldering undertones to make you swoon AND rip your heart out by wringing out your emotions. All in one book. He is unparalleled in my opinion.,,This book delves into a lot of issues and it is fascinating to watch the interplay of different relationship dynamics as the story progresses.  Eden comes into the house and navigates her individual relationship with each of the guys and pushes back wanting their ""arrangement"" to be something more.  She comes into herself which is empowering and wonderful to witness. But against this backdrop there are also other relationships at work, everyone is dealing with various traumas from their past, a previous relationship which ended badly, a male friendship under strain, an outsider in the group feeling isolated and a delicious will they won't they MM relationship played EXPERTLY by JF Harding and Teddy Hamilton. Seriously Chapter 32 is a work of art from the writer and these two bringing it to life.,,It's a must listen, I know need Book 2!!,Wow! I loved the story but it‚Äôs the casting that makes this audio book perfect. I don‚Äôt think there could be a cast which could beat this one, it‚Äôs impossible. Can‚Äôt wait for the next audiobook.,Listening to audio compared to reading a book is a completely different experience - especially when you‚Äôre already attached to the characters in written form. I will admit, I was excited but also nervous when I knew this was coming to audio because I wondered how the characters would be portrayed - I quickly realised there was nothing to be worried about. The casting of this audio book is perfect. I don‚Äôt think there could be a cast which could beat this one, it‚Äôs impossible.,Each voice actor went above and beyond for the characters they played, I felt the laughter, the joy, the sorrow and the enthusiasm with every single one and they were exactly how I imagine these characters in my head. This audio made me fall in love with the characters even more, if that‚Äôs possible? It‚Äôs overwhelming having a voice put to a character but all six of these voice actors did it so effortlessly, almost as though they were destined for these characters all along. I am speechless with the work and effort that has been put into the production of this audio book.,If you‚Äôve already read the book or if you haven‚Äôt read it yet, I definitely recommend the audio for a completely different experience. I‚Äôm excited for everyone to experience Eden and her Brutes in a completely different way.,I listened to the audio having already read the book once and loved it. The cast are phenomenal and Rebecca's writing is gripping. I can't wait for book 2! What a cliffhanger!!,This book is so good, that I got very triggered and angry at that end... I so badly need the next book... Sooo badly.,Such a brilliant audio production of a great book. Can‚Äôt wait for Entangled to come out.,Loveeed this! Listened to it in 1 day and I‚Äôm counting down for next book.,"
Twelfth Cataclysm: Crab On!,Epic,Teen & Young Adult,no reviews
Oathbringer,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Brandon Sanderson is one of the greatest story tellers writing today; and this series is his magnum opus. Book 3 is not the strongest of the series. But it still soars in many places, despite some missteps throughout.,Parts of this book left me cheering out loud! Parts of this book are truly awe inspiring.,Other parts had me shaking my head, as long established characters suddenly behaved in ways that contradicted everything the author has told us about them in the past.,For such an immense book, it surprised me how many times an obvious shortcut was taken in order to setup the next scene.,There was one long scene involving a female lead that had no purpose other than comic relief. This bungling, slapstick detour was so jarring, it was hard to return to the rhythm of the story. Worst of all, it felt amateurish, and just wasn't funny.,Almost every competent character had a moment of incompetence so glaring that it became obvious this was a deliberate gimmick. Possibly a recommendation from an editor, but taken too far?,But still, with all of that said, this is still a mostly brilliant story. The action scenes top any blockbuster movie put out this year.,It was filled with many pay-offs from the previous books, some of them setup so expertly that they still surprised me, despite the clues revealed before.,Like all of his books, this was also a vehicle for the author's social, political, and moral view of the world. Presented nicely as part of the story with not-too-much outright preaching.,What disappointed you about Oathbringer?,Book 2 could have been made into a good ending. The majority of Book 3 felt like everything that happens after the credits roll. We know more small battles, politics, reunions and rebuilding will happen after the day is saved but i don't need to read a book about it. I was never given a reason to care about anything in this book.,Has Oathbringer turned you off from other books in this genre?,No but maybe other Brandon Sanderson books.,What character would you cut from Oathbringer?,Shallan didn't grow as a character and it felt like none of her filler mini quests added anything to the plot. Way back in the first book its establish that Shallan has issues so why is it still being shoved down my throat 120 hours later? Shallan started off strong but eventually her story just lost direction and purpose. The only problem with cutting Shallan would be getting rid of Kate Readings great narration.,Any additional comments?,I have grown to hate flashbacks.,Several side stories seemed to be dropped.,Loved the first two books.,If you have read the first two books in this series, then you already know Brandon Sanderson is the greatest storyteller of our generation, and, one of the best to ever put pen to page. That is not grandiose hyperbole. It is understatement. So, now that my opinion on the author is clear, the book. The book is excellent! The pacing is great and the story progressed just the right amount for me. In my opinion, what Sanderson does the best of any writer I have ever read, is the tear-down and rebuilding of characters. I will say, that this book seems to spend more time making everything seem like it's getting worse and worse before finally we see positive change and victories for the main characters. Not really a negative for me but it does feel like there is no hope till nearly the end of the book. I am so glad Sanderson doesn't suffer from whatever George R.R Martin and Patrick Rothfuss have been afflicted with. I think we can reasonably expect the next book in 2-3 years, which is amazing considering he will also be churning out other incredible books and stories along the way.,Significant departure from what made the first books good (battles/glory) now Disneyfied with PG-13 politics/romance.,I recommended the other two books to many friends and family and unfortunately I cannot recommend this one.  The book was easy to put down for days and seemed just a long set up for a next book.  This story focused too much on the human flaws and frailties of the main characters which is not that interesting or fun to read/listen.  All victories were short lived with the next threat looming and that gets tiring after 55 hours.  It might be that my expectations were too high after the first two books in the series which I had trouble putting down and wished for more.  I prefer an epic tale of heroes with super skills and powers that have great adventures to a series of battles and failures.  I still think Brandon Sanderson is a great writer and although I did not enjoy this book I certainly could not do what he does and create and write a story like his.,I couldn't get through it. It was slow , everybody is miserable, you know bad things are going to happen, and I lost all motivation to finish.,some of the best character development I've ever experienced. the complexity and detail of everything in this book is so good. It also explores some cool philosophies.,What did you like best about Oathbringer? What did you like least?,The premise of the book was great, and the end was decent. Liked the idea of the humans not necessarily being the heroes they thought they were.The rest was just tedious.  I understood the characters after the second or third flashback, or other attempts to get me to understand. Became filler after a while. I really got tired of the Dalinar flashbacks in particular.  Some were good, but too many had little point.,How would you have changed the story to make it more enjoyable?,I love a good long book, but this was long without reason. Tedious is the best word I can use to describe it.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading  ‚Äì was your favorite?,Kaladin is by far the best character, and Michael does his usual fantastic job. Kate Reading is such a perfect pairing in with MIchael. I really enjoy all her characters, but she really nailed Shallan in particular.,Do you think Oathbringer needs a follow-up book? Why or why not?,I'm getting a bit tired of the seemingly endless layers of magic and universes. It gets to the point that nothing is impossible or final. No boundaries are no fun. No more books required for me.,Any additional comments?,Brandon Sanderson is one of my favourite authors. I was so excited for this next book in the series, but by half way through I just wanted it to get to the point. I've listened to longer books and didn't want them to end, but not this one. Once again, tedious.,I probably would not have been so harsh on other authors, but Brandon Sanderson is one of the best there is. HIs bar is higher for me. Sorry, Mr. Sanderson.,big fan of Sanderson. it seems like he struggled with this one. the jumps in location, time and plane of existence made the final wrap up weaker for me, the backstory overtook the present so much that the climax felt flat and I skipped the last 3 chapters  our main character became a predictable flat extra.,I don't give bad reviews often. but audible credits are expensive if you listen as much as me, so honestly do not expect the same level as one and two.,,The characters just keep developing into more and more.,I am very anxious to see what more comes of each of the radiants as they speak the next set of words in their oaths.,The plot continues to build and deliver new twists and surprises as it unfolds to seemingly build even more.,It has yet to get dull as most all long multiple book series tend to do at some point.  Keep it up Mr. Sanderson... I'm a fan!"
House of Sky and Breath,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Gah! It‚Äôs an Empire Strikes Back middle book, in both good and bad ways.,,Good,I loved the first book, with its fresh, snarky and compelling urban fantasy story. For the first twenty hours of this book, I was captivated by the expanding cast of characters, especially the storylines which showed old characters in entirely new light. Enemies become friends, friends lose their way, and the politics of magic makes strange bedfellows indeed. I like that, in addition to following Bryce and Hunt, folks like Ruhn and Theron have stories interwoven into the greater story.,,Bad,This book was like The Big Bang of urban fantasy, with 20+ hours of ever expanding creatures, casts, plot, magic, technology, and magic. Everything from firebirds to necromancers to fawns to demons to harpies to dragons; guns to submarines to mech-suits; magic portals to healers to telepathy. It became hard to follow along and at some point I became desensitized. Storylines and characters abruptly drop off. For instance, we hear about Viktoria, Hunt‚Äôs ally, who got trapped at the bottom of the sea in book 1‚Ä¶,and then nothing. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd make plans to rescue her, but no (maybe in the next 27 hr book).,,Bryce and Hunt are starting to become Mary Sues. Bryce in particular picks up still more powers.,There‚Äôs a stellar supporting cast, yet they don‚Äôt do much except get bailed out by the dynamic duo.,,Finally, I feel like this was a long, winding build up to a non-finale. Throughout the book there is hardly any action, then there‚Äôs a huge information dump in the final hour (where the baddies talk way too much given their supposed evil genius machinations), and then there‚Äôs zero resolution of anything. I went from being frustrated at the lack of explanation for the world, the magic, and the politics, to ten minutes of being jazzed at getting some answers, to being even more frustrated at the complete 180 in the final hour of this book. It went from The Big Bang to jumping through a black hole into a completely new storyline. Saying anything more would be spoiler-y, so I‚Äôll just say that the twists will either make book 3 awesome or jump the shark. Given the number of loose threads, I‚Äôm worried.,,Random thoughts,I am impressed at the number of strong women and LGBTQ players organically appearing (although the lack of racial diversity is odd, particularly with the gender diversity).,,I dug the ‚Äúfrog boiling in water‚Äù vibe of a world pre-Holocaust, where ordinary people don‚Äôt speak up until it‚Äôs too late to fight. However, some of the cruelty and torture got pretty dark.,,This series ventures farther from the author‚Äôs YA series and firmly into adult with drugs, language, and a lot of between the sheets action that, oddly enough, almost never actually occurs between the sheets.,I didn‚Äôt keep track, but there could have been a dozen naughty interludes ‚Ä¶ and not just for Bryce/Hunt. As a reader of both fantasy and romances, this was just peachy, but folks hoping for more YA or fade to black treatment may not like all the naughty bits.,Listened to the whole thing on 3√ó speed cuz I couldn't get enough. The spice? Perfect. The drama? Immaculate. The twists??? I was floored. I can't wait for more.,i literally lost sleep over this and I don't know how to survive the wait for the next book. i need that next book. üò≠,Honestly, a lot of the writing felt sloppy. Danica seems like a convenient excuse to fix plot holes now, and the editors really could have tightened it up to where it was half the size. The ONLY reason I‚Äôm getting the next book when it comes out is because of the last few chapters, but even then I‚Äôll probably get the physical copy so I can skim/skip the annoying sections.,Omg it is so good, i wont give any spoilers but please read it at your soonest convienience,Hate to say it but this book was just fillers until the last 8 chapters. I can normally get hooked, I struggled and forced myself to listen/read. A one time read is all I need for this book, but excited to see what the futures hold. Hope SJM didn't feel rushed and that's why this book was so lacking, hope we don't rush her future books either.,I LOVE Sarah J. Maas. This book wasn‚Äôt on a level with her other writing. The number of characters and perspectives kept the story from flowing smoothly. Lots of filler. I‚Äôm assuming that some of the seemingly pointless parts of the book were giving information and laying the groundwork for what will happen in the next book. I had been waiting anxiously for this to come out, but the only part of the book that was really riveting was the last two hours of the 24.,Wow all I can say is Wow!! This book was amazing! SJM can build a story like no other!,This book was overall a bit of a let down. There was SO much filler dialogue, very little that actually happened and Danika continually being a part of the story is a bit of a rip off. Plus, for me I was beyond annoyed at the amount of sarcasm the main characters had, especially when dealing with beings that are feared and avoided at all costs. I hope the next book makes up for this, what a disappointment.,How does someone put into words the amazing epicness that unfolds in this book?,Mind officially & epically blown!,Ok, basically do not expect this book itself to excite you like ACOTAR, but it is just a sniff of what‚Äôs to come and a prelude. The exciting part is yet to come and I cannot wait!,Story is great, so is the performance, but the title says it all. Looking forward to the next book tho.,Only downside is that I have to wait for the next part in the series to be published >:( having listened to both acotar and tog I‚Äôve enjoyed this series the most so far!,The storry is ok, but that ending... omg! Cabt wait for CC3 to get out! :D,Way January is so far away! I have to wait two months to hear the end of the story... Too long üòâ,How can you not love Sarah J. Maas books! As always love all of it, and can‚Äôt wait for the next one ü•∞,Great book! A bit slower than the previous one, but still so good. And the ending is a good surprise ü§©,As all the other books from this author, I really enjoyed the story, the twists, and the pace.,I you love fantasy and romance. I recommend this and other books by Sarah J Maas,The first book is definitly better, but this one is also sooo good! I love the universes om SJM. And this series is just *chefs kiss*! Can't wait for book nr 3, it is going to epiiiiic!,Took me much longer to go through this installment, mainly cause the Bryce:Hunt story line is not as exciting as it used to be. Additionally she is starting to be very irritating, but not in a good way. Not in a way that makes her relatable. Also - not enough of Ruhn. He is just a background to the story, and damn he was so promising. Sarah is starting to overcomplicate things. It's still a good book worth listening to, but it's not the same as the first one."

Catching Fire,"Action & Adventure,Fantasy,Dystopian",Teen & Young Adult,"Amazing book but that narrator is hard to listen to. The voices she uses for Peeta and Haymitch are so irritating. There are times when Katniss is struggling through parts of the games where the narrator sounds constipated trying to convey the struggle i guess. I wish I‚Äôd bought a different version of this audio book,Book 1 captivated me but this one just cemented my love of the series! There's no point in me getting into it about the plot because what else is there to add to the millions of others!! All I can say is YES, it's that good!! YES, it lives up to the hype, YES, it's so worth the credit. Heck, I have the Hardback, Limited Edition Hardback, Paperback and Audio of this series!! Along with Harry Potter, it's my favourite series ever! Don't stay here reading this!!! Go buy this NOW!!!!,,Tatiana Maslany performs this amazingly. She puts emotion behind her words and captures the atmosphere perfectly.,loved the series but now i love it even more woth tatiana narrating, she truly gives katniss the right tone and voice that suzanne has written,The narrator is AMAZING. Perhaps my very favorite narrator now. Tone, pacing, inflection, voices for all characters, etc. are spot on!,I have been impatiently awaiting the release of the rest of this series to be released with Tatiana Maslany as the narrator. I could not stand the sound of the other lady's voice. It was horrible. Tatiana sells this book! She actually takes to time to feel the characters and express them. Thank you for releasing these!,better off getting the ones read by Carolyn McCormick, her performance is far better. these ones are read by the most monotoned actress in existence.,I'm middle-aged, and I know I'm not the target audience for this series. However, I found the first book to be well done, and it kept my interest throughout. It was a quick read. This second book disappointed me. There were many parts that required me to greatly suspend disbelief or, at the very least, made me roll my eyes, which never happened in the first book. It felt like she had to come up with so many new ideas that some of them seemed lame to me. I thought that parts of it dragged, and I found myself checking to see how much of the book was left, hoping I was nearing the end. I will still read the third book, just to find out how it ends but I hope it feels more like listening to the first book than the second.,I read the books a few years ago and when I saw they got Tatiana to do the narration I simply had to own this. been waiting a very long time for this. thank you Audible for listening to your customers.,Why does this narrator insist on saying ""A-gaynst"" over and over instead of AGAINST? She develops an accent on literally that one word, and it's so annoying that it pulled me right out of the story every time.,I had a really hard time listening at times I didn‚Äôt care for narration. Felt monotone.,I‚Äôm 11, and this book has had me gripping my hands in suspense while trying to sleep! I normally listen to around 5 chapters a day and finished this book fairly quickly. One thing I have a problem with is that why is the Quarter Quell only a couple of chapters long! And the time before it wasn‚Äôt really needed. I found it a tad boring in the beginning. I was really annoyed(?) that why Suzanne Collins didn‚Äôt go in depth about the victory tour. And we didn‚Äôt get as much info about other tributes unlike the first book. Tomorrow I will finally watch the movie, then get Mockingjay. I was laughing when Finnick was ‚Äòflirting‚Äô with Katniss. I didn‚Äôt understand until I read it on the Hunger Games wiki. Being 11 has it‚Äôs downfalls. Tatiana Muslany(Sorry if I spelt it wrong!) is a wonderful voice for Katniss. One thing is that for some reason all males either sound like Peeta or Haymitch. I found it confusing. I would definitely recommend this book to absolutely everyone who likes dystopian books. I found it extremely clever to make it a clock! Wow, must of taken ages to write a book this awesome. Thank you Suzanne Collins, Tatiana Muslany, the company who produced the book, the company who published it(I don‚Äôt know the name, Schooltastic I think) and of course Audible! It is an extremely gripping read and it‚Äôs easy to listen to. Enjoy xxx,Really enjoyed this book , Tatiana's narration is a real pleasure. High up there with my favourite audibles,This book is amazing  because of all the drama and the story behind it all in the book makes you really connected with the characters and is a outstanding book,Amazingly written by Suzanne Collins, could not put it down. Beautifully narrated by the astounding Tatiana Maslany :),I love it cause it‚Äôs constant,Suspense I LOVE IT,I LOVE EACH CHARACTER,My favourite is Effie such A overacted person but great \,love it as much as the original audiobook love love love it(„ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ)(„ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ)(„ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ) very good yay yay yay,sadly not the best acting but still a good story. the actor is not very believable and is overdoing it to the point of making it hard to get into the story.,I feel like there could‚Äôve been more action when it came to them being in the games :( because other than that it‚Äôs a loTtt of talking and complaining and sadness and anger and talking from Katniss LOL but the narrator is really good and made it more enjoyable :),It was very nice to listen to at night to long tho make it_longer _long_books make it very enjoyable and it lasts longer so I don‚Äôt have to get a new book üìö,It had a hard job of living up to the first book and I believe it did that very well,,Could not turn it off. Headphones during chores, speakers whilst drawing and hushing the husband so I could keep listening,Another fantastic performance by Tatiana Maslany!,Riveting story made even more enjoyable by an amazing performance.,Definitely recommend this audiobook to everyone.,I listened to the entire book in two days and immediately jumped into Book 3.,Disney Pixar should be courting young Tatiana Maslany for a new project. Totally enchanting and igniting my imagination and memories of the movies.,Highly recommended.,Tatiana Maslany was brilliant, she spoke so clearly and so fluently even with the character voices.,I liked how there was the same person even with different people and it was just a very entertaining book üßî‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Can‚Äôt help wondering how many people realise they are not reading fiction. This is fact written as fiction - to make it palatable to the masses, Rich people splashing money on rubbish, while poor people suffer while making it for them. That‚Äôs history and current affairs, not fiction.,I‚Äôve enjoyed listening the book two as much as book one. Very inspired to rewatched the movies. One day when I have time to sit and enjoy reading I‚Äôm going to actually read for myself.,The success of this series should come as no surprise. Well developed and sympathetic characters, a brilliant, exceptionally well written  story with a convincing twist and flawless narration,I can‚Äôt believe that peseta lied about katniss being pregnant someone must have told him to say that like Hamish,I love the distinction between each voice and the exclamation of all the different emotions throughout the book."
Crown of Midnight,"Epic,Paranormal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I originally started this series based on the cover saying something like, ‚Äúfans of Game of Thrones will enjoy‚Äù, this series is not comparable to Game of Thrones. Very juvenile and predictable so far, and this ‚Äúassassin‚Äù is a whiny teenager girl. It‚Äôs not terrible and I‚Äôm somewhat curious about what will happen so I‚Äôm going to continue on to the next one. It‚Äôs like one of those terrible movies you can‚Äôt stop watching, you know what‚Äôs going to happen, but you still have to watch.. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,After physically reading the novellas in Assassins Blade as well as the first book Throne of Glass I stumbled upon this Audio version of book two and in my haste to find out what happens next decided to listen instead of read. Let me just say. IT. WAS. EXCEPTIONAL!! Experiencing such intricate stories, plot twists and developments from such a talented writer through audio?? I‚Äôm never going back to traditional reading after this. I must say 10/10 Fully Recommend!,the story is so engrossing. You easily get lost in this world for hours and hate to pause it for any reason.,These books are the same story that has been written to death. It proves that there is literally nothing new under the sun.,I am offended because they came very highly recommended by people who have similar tastes in books as me.,I finished the first 2 books just to be certain I wasn‚Äôt wrong.  I have developed no feelings for her characters and I could probably hit the highlights of the 3rd book without ever having to read it.,Sorry for the harsh review.  Had I just stumbled onto this book it would have been just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. But coming so highly recommended makes me wonder about people.,So, first I read the series, ‚ÄúA Quart of Thorns and Roses‚Äù and loved it.  I couldn‚Äôt wait for the next in the series, so I read ‚ÄúCrescent City‚Äù and LOVED that!  Next my friend suggested this series and I‚Äôm in love again!  Sarah J. Maas!!  How do you do it?!  They keep getting better!!,I am all for light and easy fantasy books, but this series is absurd. The story just drags with too much seudo-drama. I am done at book 2.,I love this audiobook narrator. She does such a good job of all the characters. The story is amazing and she really adds to it so much!,This series is incredible. Each book gets better and better. The suspense is, at times, almost overwhelming. I love these books and the writer. I highly recommend the series.,Love how it has twists and turns all in one‚Äôs favor. Starting the next one right now,Having spoiled some parts of the novel with fan art, I still was taken through the emotional roller coaster of this book. Thank you to the author and narrator for bringing this novel to life.,the plot twists and the drama got me breathless for most part of the book. the betrayal and romance got me crying and screaming of excitement ABSOLUTELY PERFECT"
The End and the Death: Volume II,"Adventure,Military,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I'm amazed how such important moment in this universe could be made so boring and bland,Im still listening now but all avenues have been covered in this book. all story lones/ side caracters are addressed.  I have never felt the urge to want to leap into the warhammer universe if only to stand by the Emperors side. while i may be killed within the 1st second of that fiet, the raw emptions of the custodes, and everyone in the Sol system has me weaping with sadness of what is lost.,The book wastes too much time covering very little. In the end you're just waiting for the next book to finish the story. This book provides very little and finishes nothing.,This book is awful. Why is it so long? It‚Äôs so shockingly self indulgent. For every necessary word there are 50 fluff words. It could‚Äôve been a fantastic 7-10 hour book. Instead it‚Äôs an awful 20 hour slog. Great performance from Keeble does all the heavy lifting in an otherwise shockingly bad entry in the series. Probably the worst boom we‚Äôve had from Dan Abnett who usually delivers bangers. Don‚Äôt know what went wrong here.,Utterly disappointed and the only saving grace was Keeble's performance. It's supposed to be the climatic end and 90% of the book is characters casually sitting around, going into deep monologues. The author is utterly tone deaf.,This book is about 50% filler. It‚Äôs a ton of nothing happening in vague and obtuse ways. Really disappointing.,they outdone themselves when it comes to paddling on this book.  this is a 3-4 hours book with 14-15 hours of padding. not something you would expect on the second to last book of the horus heresy...,they also skip scene even 3-5 minutes or so making it harder to immerse yourself on what is going on.,√Ä filler and underwhelming episode from a. Writer who's written the best Warhammer 40k novels. Disappointed, but excited for volume 3!,NO SPOILERS - Not a critique of the book but I had no idea there was going to be a volume three. So, just be aware and not wondering how D.A. was going to wrap everything up with a half hour left like I did.,Without spoilers, seeing character arcs completed and emotional beats hit after over a decade of this series is incredible. Fun high concept sci-fi. Some very grim dark moments. Any review claiming filler fluff doesn't know enough lore. This is a home run. A MUST listen. narration is excellent.,When all is said and done I really think this last novel is going to be viewed as being a bit bloated. The first quarter or so of this book really doesn‚Äôt advance much further from the first volume - Dorn is still trapped, Sanguinius is closing in on Horus etc, this stuff is reiterated just one too many times in my opinion. I get that the book is trying to build up an enormous amount of tension and emphasise the scale of what‚Äôs happening but it did cross the line a little bit for me.,If I were playing devil‚Äôs advocate I‚Äôd say that this ‚Äúbloated‚Äù aspect of the text is intentional, as a sense of timelessness and events being dragged out is a big theme in the book.,But regardless once the story does pick up there‚Äôs a lot of great stuff. I won‚Äôt spoil too much but it went in a direction I really didn‚Äôt expect, but that I found really engaging. Things start to get very weird as time and space start to lose coherence as Horus reveals his full power.,The vision of the last battle Abnett is creating is a lot more nuanced than the old long established lore suggests. Which I think is a good thing. All that old lore is still here but it‚Äôs just given so much more scope. It really does feel like the old lore is just the barely remembered myth of the events in this book.,Only real disappointment I had in this book is the apparent abandonment of a major plot thread from volume 1. It‚Äôs made out to be the most important thing ever in volume 1 and for the majority of this volume, then near the end it is just seemingly resolved, and will no longer play a factor ‚Äúin this era at least‚Äù to quote the text.,Again don‚Äôt want to spoil too much. But the big thing that was definitely going to happen according to volume 1, now just isn‚Äôt happening, which seems kind of lame honestly. Maybe volume 3 will deliver on something relating to that plot thread but it seems to be done with.,,I'm listening to the script for a loonytoon's episode,..  so far it consists 97% of characters leaving through one door, then immediately re-entering the same room via another door...,Every character has a scenario like this,.. minimal development of the major arcs...,did I mention, I'm 9 hours in? by this point, it is loonyroons mixed with Groundhog day - This explains how BlackLibrary suddenly managed to find enough text for a 3rd book!,,I wrote an essay when I was 12 where I said the ghost of Xmas past is an important ghost. That is this book to a tee constantly telling you in endless detail how nuts everything is without just showing you. A complete slog,GW's cash cow continues, they could've and should've ended it here but no, there's going to be another book. The performance was brilliant as always and I liked the book, i'm just annoyed it hasn't ended.,This could have been a novella. Shameless monetising of a series to the detriment of it's quality. Bits are good, don't get me wrong, but 70% was waffle, I assume that part 3 with share the waffle to story ratio. I feel that this is a cynical attempt to tease a single long novel out to three parts to sell more books and this has let down the penultimate book of an epic saga. If you enjoyed the rest of the series, you know you will get this one, and you will enjoy it, but I expect you will feel cheated by GW like me somehow......,Like vol 1, TEATD vol 2 feels in dire need of a braver editor - one willing to hack away at Abnett's compulsion to A) require the reader to use a dictionary and B) spend a huge amount of words on characters doing very little for most of the book. Either that or the author was asked to pad it out as much as possible for commercial reasons. I,When the bits everyone is reading the book for arrive, the action is split into an annoying number of non-consecutive chapters. These quirks are aggravated by the audiobook format ‚Äì listening it to the first time, you can't simply skip to the good bits and the constant twitching of perspective makes it hard and irritating to follow. The emotional payoffs keep feeling out of reach and it feels like the literary equivalent of coitus interruptus ‚Äì massively unsatisfying for everyone involved.,Despite listening to much of the Horus Heresy novels so many times I can quote them from memory - I have very little intention of coming back to this mess any time soon. I consider Know No Fear and Betrayer to the high watermark of the HH/SoT series and TEATD is incredibly less enjoyable to listen to. I guess to some extent, there are factors beyond the author""s control ‚Äì this has to wrap up a lot of plot threads, there is limited room for maneuver, and the general plot is by its nature very negative.,Part 2 suffers from a massive wasted opportunity ‚Äì there is a confrontation that could have easily riffed off some of the best bits of Betrayer but somehow both characters don't appear to recognise each other/acknowledge their shared past.,In addition, much of the physicality of a besieged force holding out to the bitter end is completely absent . Ammunition shortages, Astartes committing cannibalism out of need and to remember their fallen, together with widespread use of combat drugs with crippling long-term effects taken in the knowledge that there probably won't be a tomorrow would have really helped.,My advice is to not bother with the audiobooks and borrow all three volumes from a library, because this isn't a book you'll want to reread, much less relisten to.,,every single chapter is a 10/10. had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning,Except the voices outside my wall are whispering ‚ÄúTO BE CONCLUDED IN THE END AND THE DEATH VOLUME 3‚Äù,Some good plot development on certain characters but this story has less meat on it than a Servitor.,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!,There are lots of plots to follow, so probably gonna have to gladly give it a second listen. sad that the series is coming to an end but it's ending with a bang at least.,not a simple case of a linear story. there's so many threads being woven to complete the final picture. really short chapters jumping all over the place but not jarring at all in my opinion. a great 2nd book of the trilogy. absolute torture now having to wait for the finale.,great job by Dan üëèüëèüëè,basically all the parts you want to be great, ie those focusing on the heroes aboard the vengfull spirit. The rest seems unnecessary, I skipped many chapters not focusing on the characters I cared about and shaved quite a bit off the runtime and reckon I had a better experience for doing so.,The action is great and well written, the final fight of the book is excellent. There is just entire character arcs that could be shortened or cut altogether.,my advice is listen but feel free to skip here and there.,The voice performance was great, however the story itself felt stretched far to much without adding anything. Couldve been a part shorter at least. Thankfully it should mean that Vol 3 will be excellent as theres nothing else to stretch out,don't waste your time. just a bunch of dead ends and confusion. abnett must have written this on heroin,the story was good but it felt drawn-out.  lots of side stories that didn't feel relevant so was difficult to stay invested. Narration was outstanding,I loved Part I, but man, Part II moves slooow. I feel like I could‚Äôve skipped a few full hours here and there and missed nothing. There must‚Äôve been hours spent repeating ‚Äútime and space is all messed up‚Äù over, and over, and over, and over again.,Voice acting is incredible and it makes the whole thing more enjoyable.,Heartbreaking and beautiful. I cannot wait for volume three. Simply fantastic and worth every step of the way to get us to this point.,Astonishing, cannot wait for part three. Dan has done a fantastic job working the horus heresy into a masterpiece.,I thought the use of scenes in this book was really well done. There weren‚Äôt too many scenes that didn‚Äôt matter or finally started to pay off. There are still some story lines that need to be resolved but so far they‚Äôre progressing. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,A great addition albeit focused a bit too much on certain legions, but that‚Äôs understandable given the current situation. Would have liked more from the primarchs. Overall I liked this one better than part one, more action and deeper story line development. There were times I genuinely could not put the book down. Looking forward to the final book!,Had to return this book because the chapters keep skipping randomly. Could not listen to this book properly in chapters. Unless they fix this don't know how anyone can listen to this book with confidence."
The Eye of the Bedlam Bride,"Epic,Humorous",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"It would be an understatement if I said that this book was my most anticipated audiobook for the last year. It‚Äôs also not surprising that I download it at the moment it became available and put in a marathon session to finish it. At this point in the series, anybody interested in the book has already listened to the preceding five books. As such, this is who I am writing this review for. We already know that Dungeon Drawler Carl is amazing, well written and well voice acted series. So where does the Bedlam Bride stand in relationship to the other books in the series?  I can‚Äôt say that it is the best book in the series.  From a story point of view it‚Äôs probably number four.  But as for character development and plot advancement, it is clearly the most important book in the series yet. The full reveal of Carl‚Äôs backstory makes the book one of the most important plot points of the DCC universe. The consequences of nearly every action taken by the characters to this point, comes into play or culminates in this book. The chaos that Carl unleashes at the closing of floor 8 drastically outstrips the manic conclusion of book 5. The concept of cards based combat is perfectly executed, and understandable. My only regret from this book is a distinct lack of interaction with Pony. Of course, the inclusion of Patrick Warburton as Carl‚Äôs estranged dad more than compensates for any disappointment I felt from the lack of Pony. Matt has constructed what must truly be one of the most complicated SciFi/Fantasy worlds in the last 30 years. The voice talent of Jeff Hayes remains stellar and one of the most endearing aspects of the series.  Hard decisions are made, heartstrings are pulled, and at least one key character meets their demise. What more could you ask for in a single audiobook?  Now the count down begins for book 7!!!,I first discovered DCC during the pandemic and I caught a fever for this story and not the other thing. I gave it to my girlfriend as well and we have binged the entire series multiple times. The first book is really good, the second is better and they keep getting better as the world gets bigger and more complex. Whenever I describe this series to the uninitiated I say it‚Äôs like Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide and Hunger Games had a Three Way with a DND movie directed by Quinton Tarantino. There is no better pairing of writer and vocal performance that I am aware of than Matt and Jeff in all of Audible. As far as this specific installment of the series goes‚Ä¶ if you have made it this far and don‚Äôt realize how epic it is, there is no help for you :-),Honestly, if you‚Äôve gotten this far you probably like the series.,But if you‚Äôre still on the fence, I‚Äôll tell you that this book is a dichotomy of basically the darkest and most depressing stuff ever, sewn together with the most hilarious s**t I‚Äôve ever heard. Probably my favorite book. Not just in the series, but my favorite book ever.,The series has been great. This book seems much different than the others. There are more details and not as much character development. Doughnut‚Äôs voice has changed. The original seems much better.,Saying I was hooked is an understatement. I found myself almost incapable of stopping the book. Truly is best book yet. Wonderful imagery and twists, that will both disgust and thrill.,This one was a slog to finish, it had promising elements but I would have preferred the book been two books which told the same events but let the story breathe and not be dog piled with too many elements all at once. The floor mechanic was absolutely awful and actually took away from events taking place. Still love the series but if I ever relisten I'll probably just skip a lot to get the important bits.,Carl should be one of the top 3 strongest players in the game with all of his advantages. Yet, except for the occasional use of explosives and abundance of luck, he gets his but(t) whipped by everything. Don't even get me started on the cat! lol!... highly annoying! Almost every aspect of this book is pathetic, and the only thing that almost saves it is the narrator(s).  Anyone giving this 5 stars needs their head examined.,Matt Dinniman's first couple Dungeon Crawler Carl books were fun.  The first three were absolutely excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Book four started introducing some heavier elements and some character backstory that added some more depth to the characters but unfortunately started dragging the books down.  Book five was good and fun in parts but too much of a drag in other parts and a lot less fun to listen to.  Book six, The Eye of the Bedlam Bride is just a drag and not fun at all.,,This one has been a Did Not Finish for me.  I had to keep taking breaks from this one as it was just too depressing and disturbing and no fun at all.  The action scenes aren't even any fun and the game concept of this level makes no sense to me so there is nothing interesting to follow.  I noticed that my breaks from this audio book kept getting longer as I would find fun and entertaining books to listen to and help recover from this book in each break.  Finally I realized I didn't want to continue with this torture session anymore.,,The performances of the narrators is also getting really old and annoying.  I don't know which narrators do which characters but the characters that yell and scream all the time and the jarring transitions from one character's thoughts and words going from all sad and melancholy to another character screaming absurdities at the next second makes this book unpleasant at best to listen to.,,The situation in the story universe is getting more dire and it should be compelling to see what is going to happen and how our protagonists are going to triumph.  Only the story and writing along with the narration is so melancholy and depressing that you just don't want to continue anymore.,What captured me about this series is the humor, the story line, and the depth of the story. The book with the train stations was perhaps a tinge too complex to accommodate a smooth read, but still really good. This volume, however, read like someone trying to make a joke at the expense of someone they are angry with. The ""joke"" is more aggressive than funny and it comes across more of a jab than humorous. Furthering not being as funny (it happens. Sometimes shit isn't funny) it was spiritually insensitive. (furthering - as it continues to farthen),,This volume got inappropriately offensive to Christians. Not like ""Southpark"" offensive where they make fun of everyone and you come to terms with it when it reaches your ""turn,"" so to speak,, but blasphemously inappropriate. You know those memes that say, ""if you laugh at this you're going to hell""? Fortunately, the hateful jokes aren't funny enough to laugh at.,,It almost feels like Matt D. tried to joke about something that he is literally angry at. *'Yes, it's okay to end a sentence with a preposition if aren't speaking Latin. It wasn't funny; it was hurtful.,,I'll probably get the next books in the series, but I will skip ahead, thirty seconds at a time, until it isn't hatefully trashing my religion. I won't recommend this series anyone else. I've gotten two people hooked on it, but not after reading this book.,,,I‚Äôve listened to all of these books, and since book one I‚Äôve been a DCC fan. This one was hard to gauge, maybe I‚Äôm too old for this card system crap; but almost every combat scenario I was left confused and unsatisfied. I used to love the ‚Äúachievements‚Äù; this book however, seemed to have chaotic and pseudo-political tangents on almost every other achievement. I understand that this is supposed to be the AI going crazy, fine. Still, I think I heard some ‚Äúachievements‚Äù that had almost 2-5 minutes worth of tangents that left me bewildered and asking wtf I just heard.,The drama was overwrought and dragged out to the point of breaking. The editor used Carls ‚Äúheavy moment‚Äù voice a little too much imo. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something in this book/series, but I found myself spacing out with rolled eyes almost every time thing got ‚Äúheavy‚Äù.,I have to say I found myself disappointed in this one, and I don‚Äôt what this to be the end of an era. The first 5 books were so in sync and relatable to an extent; this one was so melodramatic that every instance of drama was drawn so thin I found myself board. Again maybe I missed something, but I was disappointed.,Aww, i binge-listened to this one, i really couldn‚Äôt help it, and now i have to wait until the next book is released‚Ä¶,The pokemon thing was completely grafted on and didn‚Äôt resonate with me, still a decent listen, with excellent voicing.,It‚Äôs a shame people from a non-gaming background will never hear this, because it‚Äôs exceptionally good.,The whole LitRPG you can divide into two sections. DCC, and everything else.,DCC is a cut above. Matt, you‚Äôre a legend, and same with Jeff. He makes it come alive n an exceptional way.,Congrats to everyone behind this.,These books are fun and just keep getting more nuanced. Absolutely love them - can't wait for the next one.,a brilliant addition, maybe even best of the series for me so far. Jeff Hayes hits every beat as a narrator and I'm sure was pretty stoked to have the inspiration for Carl's voice (Patrick Warburton) as a guest.,Genuinely laugh out loud in places we with imagery that you have never though of in your life ha. I'm thinking crabs and seals here.,New Achievement - You have read an audible review for this book. Great job. Haven't made up your mind after 5 books already? You meat sacks are so indecisive.,Matt managed to surpass himself with this new volume. The story is unfolding even more and as it does it makes you want for more. Jeff‚Äôs performance‚Äôs absolutely incredible. Next stop is sound booth theatre‚Äôs tunnel immersion of the first book can‚Äôt wait to relive the story!,5-Stars. Love this, hurry up and bring out book 7! (Let's get the audiobook started early),Truly a masterpiece of a series. I almost cried when it finished as the wait will be difficult. but I'm planning another few listens,Damn, can't wait to find out what happens next. Top tier story and performance as always.,Gripping, funny and entertaining. I just can‚Äôt get enough of these books and am so excited for the next. The narrating is sublime as well,Another amazing installment of DCC, nothing else to say apart from WHEN IS THE NEXT AUDIO BOOK OUT.,This is one of my most favourite series I‚Äôve ever listened to! Filled with humor and action and gross stuff!! Everything a girl can dream of!,The worst part of this series is having to wait for the next book to release.,This series has everything. Great set pieces, amazing characters, hilarious hijinks, gore galore and dangerous twists and turns. You won‚Äôt be bored, but you might be groaning in disgust or laughing at some poor soul‚Äôs misfortune from time to time. Sublime narration by Jeff adds extra twinkle to this diamond in the rough.,Cannot wait for the next instalment!,My first review and im happy to say this is One of the best series i have listened to,Loved every book so far,I think this series broke litrpgs for me. I compare them all to this series and struggle to find anything coming close to matching this story, world building and production quality. need that next book asap,Great series. Easy to listen to. Funny and a great story! Can‚Äôt wait for the next book,Great story, more please!!! Heart shaped boxers, here we come. I am gonna patent them lol,‚Ä¶and Matt Dinniman along with the Soundbooth Theater narrators prove that for the 6th time with Eye of the Bedlam Bride.,ü§ì After 6 books the brilliance of the main characters, along with the regular guests, creatures, landscapes, climates, quests, spells, challenges, skill levels, inventory‚Äôs  AND  ü´£ the AI.,We have ü§ó again been rewarded for our devoted listening by reaching the next level ü´£ we now get to kick back and contemplate whether Matt Dinniman‚Äôs  childhood / diet / education or lifestyle choices are responsible for his superb ability to weave the finest tales of marauding, mutants, massacres, mayhem and friendships to the end.,Thank you to Matt, Jeff, Annie, Patrick, Travis and others involved in bringing Carl and Donut into our lives, so very much appreciated. ü§ì,They have done it again! Great story, great performance and an all-round stellar experience.,Love the writing, love the jokes, spewin we have to wait til book 7 for some payback. Matt‚Äôs writing and Jeff‚Äôs narration are fantastic. Wish I could get a potion to forget I‚Äôve heard the series so I can experience it again."
You Needed Me,"African American,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"Where is part 2 ? The story is really cute..... I need part 2 I feel unfinished I am to busy to sit and  actually read the book.,The story was not as good as what I usually love about this author,  but the narration just made it painful.  the female was inconsistent and the attempts at accents was TERRIBLE.,I‚Äôve read this book many times years ago and I am glad to finally get the audio version. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one."

Mockingjay,"Action & Adventure,Fantasy,Dystopian",Teen & Young Adult,"So many reviews say that this is the worst of the trilogy, but, for me anyway, this is right up there with the rest, just in a different way. There is no way that anyone could stay the same having endured what Katniss and Peeta endured and I think Suzanne Collins reflected that in the way Katniss is in this. She is heartbroken, depressed, sad, guilty and everything else and it's all battling inside her head. She is broken and maybe nothing will bring her together, but she is trying! My heart broke for her so many times, my heart broke for Peeta, my poor broken heart broke some more for their relationship and then my heart shattered at the end!! No matted how many times I read this book, it never fails but to affect my emotions!!,,‚ÄúYou love me. Real or not real?""  *Sigh*,,Again, Tatiana Maslany narrated this brilliantly. She made Katniss come alive here and portrayed her brokenness perfectly.,,Anyway, this series is phenomenal and I urge everyone to try it at least once!,Tatiana Maslany was the perfect choice for these books. Listening to them with her narrating brought Katniss and all the horror that was her life and makes it sound real. Don't listen if you don't want to cry.,I've listened to the hunger games series at least a dozen times via a disc set I bought but this was the first time I've heard it read by Tatiana and it was soooooo much better. the parts I thought were narrated oddly by the other reader, i didn't think much of except to make fun of by how oddly it was read. now that I've heard Tatiana narrate, i will never go back. With the other narrator I was distracted by her odd choices of emotion at times that didn't fit Katniss's character , but with Tatiana's reading, I cried several times when I've never cried reading or listening to this series in the many before. she's pulled the emotion from deep in her soul for this one and I know it will stick with me. üò≠,Love the story, wished I would have known it was a different narrator.  Not sure how she got this job, her voice is not audio quality. I  want to ask for my money back but it looks this is the only version available in Audiblebook.  l,Looked for the version narrated by Carolyn McCormick but is not available. Disappointed customer.,I keep saying this but I forgot how different yet similar the books and movies are. Johanna and Katniss form this odd friendship in this book it was more meaningful I think than what was in the movies.,,Even Katniss‚Äôs mother isn‚Äôt as shaky in the books as she was in the movies its odd to see her so capable. But you still really see that animosity Katniss has for her because of how she didn‚Äôt fight when her husband died. You can‚Äôt blame Katniss either she was what 11 and had to become strong enough to keep her family from starving.,,I have been thinking about these books a lot in the last few days of listening and I don‚Äôt think we give Haymitch enough credit. If we take a look at him he was the winner of the second quarter quill and as we know there were twice as many tributes he had to outlive. Then he became a mentor and in 23 years he never had one be a winner so he had to see 46 tributes die while he watched. No wonder he was always in the bottle.,,I also forgot how these books made my heart pump and how I felt reading now listening to them. You almost forget its children killing children for politics. It‚Äôs crazy.,,I said it before but I will say it again I really enjoyed Tatiana‚Äôs narration she really did a great job give each book life. Especially with the subject matter, but also when the climax happens she really gave us those emotions. Very enjoyable to listen to.,,Best book ever love it so much helps me under stand everything much better could re-listen every nightüåô,I recommend this book to everyone. Although it is set in a future timeline the lessons of the 3rd book, this book are timeless. The narrator for these three books is amazing. I wish could have done some of the other books I have read,Oh My Goodness, this is great. It was so amazing and I couldn‚Äôt stop listening!,Why did audible use a different reader than Carolyn McCormick?,Does not sound like a professional reader.,The story and performance work perfectly together to bring the Hunger Games trilogy to a memorable conclusion.  I loved it all.,Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing,Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing,Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing,It was amazing it was superb it was exciting,It was just amazing I loved it.,Tatiana has conquer my heart in this saga,  she's excellent acting out the scenes and a wonderful voice for Katniss, to summarize I will be listening to this books again and again.,I really like chickpea curry‚Äôs especially if it has lots of spices and some butter beans,increcredible- as always. the message and heart behind these stories are so deep and meaningf, especially in the times we live in- I hope you enjoy them as much as I did,I love it,It‚Äôs really helping me through a tough time I‚Äôm high school and I think that Katniss really represents a beautiful young girl,Tatiana deserves a big Pat on the back for this it‚Äôs amazing she‚Äôs so good at voice acting and a role model for me because I want to do voice acting,I love the books and films and I love the narrator,üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü 100% don't regret buying it,The whole series was incredibly well written, rich and deep storyline with diverse, fleshed out characters. The narration was excellent, it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúread‚Äù it was performed and very well done. Tatiana‚Äôs narration is very emotionally driven which works perfectly for a book written in the first person perspective. Would recommend to anyone who has either seen the films and enjoys them or just loves very original stories. As any book lover would say, the books are far better than the films!,The narrator is incredible. A very dramatic and thrilling ending to the trilogy. Bittersweet ending, realistic yet hopeful.,fabulous book 3rd in collection.  finishs the hunger games trilogy which interesting regarding human behavior,Very good book. Love the films? You owe it to yourself to listen to this,This book was riveting. very well written and the narrator was terrific. l felt like l was watching a movie.,everything about this book series gives me life i cannot explain. i just love this book & movie series.,Can‚Äôt help wondering how many people realise they are not reading fiction. This is fact written as fiction - to make it palatable to the masses, Rich people splashing money on rubbish, while poor people suffer while making it for them. That‚Äôs history and current affairs, not fiction.,It‚Äôs a really good book it‚Äôs very interesting to listen to the books amazing go read it,I just got the grimace shake, ooh that sounds delicious, do you want the grimace shake? Yes it‚Äôs so nutritious! HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRIMACE! WHAT IS ON YOUR AMAZON WHISHLIST,Absolutely loved this . It is thought provoking and so very human . The narrator was perfect. Thankyou Suzanne Collins . What a read !,I loved hearing the story I read almost 20 years ago being read by Tatiana. She naturally moves between each character‚Äôs voices, making you feel like multiple people are contributing to the story. Highly recommend all three Hunger Games books ready by her.,Best book ever of all time I could read it hundreds of times and never get bored of reading / listening to it,One of the the most interesting and engaging stories ever. The character and their backgrounds are really interesting.,,I'm blown away by how good this series is. I was hesitant for a start as the narration put me off.,3 books later I think she did an amazing job. it's the first book that I've been really excited to jump back into. in-between sessions. the last 2 books I finished over 2 days. I didn't want to put it down.,great job team,"

Eldest,"Literature & Fiction,Epic",Teen & Young Adult,"I found myself enjoying this title the more the title progressed. It was one of those books that tends to build so smoothly up to those points of sheer action. Also of specific note is the growth that one is able to witness in the general writing style of the author. The way Christopher Paolini seems to tackle certain issues in this book as opposed to book one (Eragon) also lent to the book being even more enjoyable than the previous.,Book 2 of the Inheritance Cycle is your typical mythical fantasy novel. I couldn't help but notice slight similarities with Star Wars regarding some of the twists that the story takes. That being said, I found the entire title put together very well. In this book you get a glimpse in the lives of the elves and see as Eragon himself grows into an impressive Dragon Rider. Another great addition to this story was Roran, Eragon's cousin, whose own struggles and quest becomes even more challenging and exciting than Eragon's it would seem. A number of new characters were introduced in this title and it would seem that no one from the previous novel was forgotten either, all reappearing in some form or another through the scope of the title.,The narration grew on me throughout this book. You sometimes forget that it is one person doing the narration even though there are so many distinct voices, tones and intonations in the title. The narration in this case only adds to the title here.,Truly an impressive listen all over. I look forward to listening to the third book in this series.,Like the book- hate the voice used for all the Dragons.  Saphira is a female dragon but for some reason Doyle believes her voice should sound just like Cookie Monster from Sesame Street.,I‚Äôve owned this series of books for several years and as I started reading back through them I decided to get the audible version... it was a waste. I couldn‚Äôt get past the first chapter because the narration was so bad. The overly thick accent of the narrator made it difficult enough, but when Saphira‚Äôs ‚Äòvoice‚Äô was conveyed he made it sound like a troll! I couldn‚Äôt listen any longer. Dragons are majestic, magical, and powerful in Paolini‚Äôs world. The narrator made her sound brutish, unintelligent, and barely understandable. Absolutely horrible! Literally the worst narration I‚Äôve heard on audible in my many years and scores of titles.,I thought book one was good but book two is even better with more twists and unexpected surprises.  I loved the action and suspense.  I could not stop listening to the book and cannot wait until book 3 comes out to finish the story.,Great story. A standard hero quest but very enjoyable to listen to and I found myself caring about the characters. It built well upon Eragon and I'm looking forward to the next book. I found myself admiring the narrator more and more as the book went on he did an excellent job. I think this is one story best heard, I agree with another reviewer this may have been a bit heavy reading, but being able to relax and enjoy the ride was perfect. Good job and definitely will finish out the series when it is done.,The story is without a doubt, one of the best I've ever been exposed to. It is simple to follow, yet full of enough adventure to thrill any reader.,If the book doesn't keep your attention, the reader, Mr Doyle will keep you interested. His voice inflections, various voices, etc are the very best I've heard since becoming an Audible member.,Everyone with the remotest interest needs to download/ buy this book!,,Richard Allen, RN,love the narration, just feel like safiras voice could be less raspy :P but everything else is amazing.,I expected more from this series and am now on a quest of my own: to finish it, no matter how hard. There are scenes that I have enjoyed in these books, and for an author's first attempts into writing, these are very good. I would even say thhat they are excellent...for that level of author. Unfortunately, they are not good on the level of other authors, and the borrowed LOTR names and insights are disturbing to a die-hard LOTR fan. Here are but a FEW striking similarities. I have read that he had other inspirations but the similarities remain very annoying to me as I navigate the books.,,1. Eragon / Aragorn,2. Beor Mountains / Beor from the Hobbit,3. The Grey Folk / The Grey Elves,4. The Dwarves and their origins are almost taken exactly from the Silmarillion.,5. The use of song to create things is also exactly how Middle Earth was created in the Silmarillion.,6. Eragon's poem that uses the words ""the land of shadow"" multiple times is strikingly similar to Tolkien's ""In the Land of Mordor, where the shadows lie"",7. Ellesmera = Lothlorien,,Much of the other parts of the book seem original enough, but these are just a few of the DIRECT similarities with LOTR that I have to really swallow or I would toss the book altogether.,,Other criticisms are the overly descriptive discussions of inconsequential things...meals etc. that do not fit with other parts of the story. Tolkien was descriptive of absolutely everything, while here some things are described in detail while others are not, and there is no rhyme or reason as to why one is explained and another glossed over.,,The reader gives Eragon a very high pitched voice, which seems to make Eragon mad every time he opens his mouth.  It is less so in this book, but the first book was terrible for the constant ""high-pitched soft-yell"" that was Eragon's voice.,,Having said all this, I am still listening to the audiobook and like it enough to finish it...but I am not quite sure why.,I love this book but the narration ruins it! The little ""voices"" that Doyle makes for the characters are often mocking and diminish the characters' weight. Does he know that Saphira is female?,The narration on this amazing book is excellent!  I listened to this book while on an exercise bike, and increased to 1 hour a day because I wanted to hear what would happen next!  It's a great listen for a long drive, as well.,,I would recommend this to any fantasy/sci-fi fan for a great adventure.,,The author doesn't talk down to the audience, and he has taken a character through a difficult changes with help from wise mentors and good friends.  A good reminder for those of us on either side of that equation.,The story is amazing and Gerard Doyle is just wonderful in his narration... Wonderful all round. The story can take you away and immerse you in so much magic. So pleased to have found this is my later years as it has brought me back the joy I had in reading Harry Potter, The hobbit and other such fantasies as a child. I am pleased I kept this new adventure for another time in my life when an adventure was sorely needed.,Loved the story. I recommend it to anyone who would like to forget themselves in a well written tale."
Iron Gold,"Fantasy,Adventure,Dystopian,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"What disappointed you about Iron Gold?,I despised the new narrators. I just listened to 3 books that were masterfully done, then you give me this. I don't understand why you change it up. Tim was so good by himself.,Story is okay, not up to the standards of the first 3 books. The narrators are okay except the audio really needs to be more balanced. If I have it loud enough to hear the quiet parts, the loud parts are piercing. This make sections of the book almost unbearable.,Tim Gerard Reynolds is the most perfect gorydamn narrator for the poetry Pierce Brown writes. I cannot even focus on the story, the other narrative is so obnoxious. AUDIBLE FIX THIS!!!,How could the performance have been better?,I understand the appeal of a cast of narrators but a part of me wishes Tim Gerard Reynolds narrated the entire book. He is so intricately entwined with the original trilogy that is startling when you first hear a new narrator early in the book. Honestly, I want a solo version with only Tim....that or switch it up and form a super-group of Tim Gerard Reynolds, Kate Reading, and Michael Kramer...could you imagine?,TGR needs to go back and narrate the entire book. The other narrators completely ruin the experience for me.,What made the experience of listening to Iron Gold the most enjoyable?,Tim Gerald Reynolds is a master narrator. Reynolds has already developed the voices for these characters in 3 other books. Adding the other narrators takes away from TGR performance and the Red Rising experience. It does not flow effortlessly like the other books and gets confusing. Missed the mark as far as the audible version is concerned.,the narration, the story is all great but the audio volume is poorly balanced so it's hard to hear unless you're in a really quiet environment. the loud parts are too loud and the quiet parts are too quiet.  can't really listen to it on the go.,My review is purely on the quality of the audio book.  I have some issues with the story as well, but as I haven't finished it yet, I'm willing to reserve judgment.,,Overall, the quality of the audio mixing for this book was pretty bad.  From chapter to chapter and sometimes even within chapters, there are noticeable changes in volume that force me to adjust the volume far more often than I'm comfortable with.,,My biggest complaint about the audio book though, is with the narrators for the Lysander and Lyria chapters.  The narrator who ""plays"" Lysander speaks in a clipped and businesslike manner, rarely lending any sense of drama to even some of the more dramatic sections.  There were times when I wondered if he was paid by the word and was trying to get through it as quickly as possible.  By contrast, the Lyria narrator seems to only speak in completely frantic or utterly furious tones (even when narrating very simple sections) to the point that her voice becomes grating and difficult to listen to.  Both the Lyria and Lysander narrators seem to pay little attention to punctuation, often running over obvious pauses that sometimes make it difficult to follow dialogue.,,I certainly understand why there were four narrators for this book given the story structure, I just find their quality quite disjointed.  Tim Gerard Reynolds does a fantastic job in this book as in the previous ones and I thought that the narrator for Effraim is nearly as good.  It is to the point where I dread hearing the introduction to a Lysander or Lyria chapter because while I find their stories very interesting, it can feel like a chore to get through them.,What disappointed you about Iron Gold?,I prefer to have only one person narrate the book. The multiple narrarators detracted and distracted from the book so much that I turned it off after the beginning of the 7th chapter. Booo and shame on them for thinking this was a good idea.,What was one of the most memorable moments of Iron Gold?,Poor performances.,How did the narrator detract from the book?,Why change a good thing? Tim Gerard Reynolds did a fine job of the first three books. What made them think it would be a good idea to add an additional 3 persons?,What reaction did this book spark in you? Anger, sadness, disappointment?,I'm severely disappointed in the portrayal of this book enough that I want a refund. It was not the way I intended to enjoy this book.,This book was awful, like seriously, it feels like a standalone and should have been. I love the original series and it should have ended at book 3. This one feels disjointed and all over the place. Reaching for a plot and storyline. I wanted to so badly to love it but it was such a hard listen. The first three, I couldn't wait to press play and continue when the kids were in bed or I was driving in the car--this one, I had to force myself to listen to.,,SO sad for this series.,I'll not say too much about the plot or story of Iron Gold but will say that I felt like it was a worthy sequel to the original Red Rising trilogy and that I felt the 10 year time jump and expanded POV cast did more to enhance the story than damage it. I love Darrow but I warmed to a few of the new characters and felt like they offered a different perspective on things which in turn gave the world a bit more depth to it.,Pierce Brown really is my sort of author. His writing is highly engaging and has a beautifully melancholic and poetic feel to it. His books are always intense and exciting and really drag me through the emotional ringer from start to finish. It is great when you find a book where you find the story super exciting and can emotionally engage with the characters and happenings.,On to the important stuff: Recorded Books decision to bring in three additional narrators!,I had some serious concerns going into Iron Gold when I heard that Recorded Books had decided to limit Tim Gerard Reynolds role in the book by brining in three new narrators to voice the three new POV's. The only positive was that they had retained TGR for the Darrow POV segments. I'm still puzzled by why they thought this was a good idea as TGR is one of the best narrators out there and his performance of the original Red Rising was fantastic. One of the best performances of any audio I've ever heard (and I've listened to hundreds of audios over the years!). The guy was so good he enhanced the quality of an already great story with his ability to convey emotion with his voice and his excellent voice acting.,It goes without saying that TGR's Darrow POV section of Iron Gold were as fantastic as one would expect. His take on Apollonius was stand out good and worthy of praise!,So how did the new narrators get on? They were a bit of a mixed bag.,John Curless - He did the Ephraim POV segments and I thought he was fantastic. Almost as good as TGR with his ability to convey emotions and he really got the tone and humour of the story. If he had a flaw it was that his character voices, while pretty good, were just not quite as good as TGR's. Still, he gets the thumbs up from me and I'll be happy to listen to more books he narrates in the future.,Aedin Moloney - She voiced the Lyria POV segments. I felt like she did an decent job. I took a bit of time to get used to her strong Irish accent and her dramatic style but once I did I warmed to her quickly. She struggled a little with the set voices and accents of the established characters but seemed to get the tone of the story and was also quite good at conveying emotion with her voice.,Julian Elfer - The guy voiced the Lysander bits of the story. I felt like he was the real weak link and the only narrator not up to the job. He was pretty awful. The only good thing he had going for him was that he was well-spoken and his voice was a great fit for an upper class Gold. The problem is that he was a poor voice actor and just read everything in a monotone. He even failed to get the humour which sounded decidedly off and stilted via his poorly timed delivery. He was also not great with the dialogue in general. It was often tough to figure out which characters were speaking!,At least the production by Recorded Books was not awful. To their credit they had the new narrators retain the accents used by TGR in the original RR trilogy. It is a minor thing but really makes a difference as it helps with consistency.,I feel like this would have been better if they had just stuck with TGR as the narrator for the whole book but that the additional narrators did not overly hurt my enjoyment of the audio as two of them were good and only Elfer was not up to the job.,three new narrators who haven't a clue how to read this. was so looking forward to hearing time G√©rard Reynolds superb narration as before bring him back to redo this completely.  hope he's doing the rest.,Good book, but the move to multiple narrators didn't work for me overall. TGR great and Julian Elfer decent (good voice, but delivery a bit flat); John Curless seems an impressive narrator, but sounds far too old for the character he's playing, which I found jarring. However, Aedin Moloney's painfully affected, overwrought performance completely ruined those sections for me.,Great story, partially ruined by the painfully overdramatic and shrill narration of Lyria. Please recast!,Thoroughly enjoyed this latest offering by Pierce Brown. Tim Gerard Reynolds is outstanding as always. John Curless, and Aedin Moloney also do an admirable job with Lyria and Ephraim. However Julian Elfers Lysander may be some of the worst narration I've heard in my 5 years with Audible. Rushed, clipped and monotonous.,I find the mixed narration jarring. I will not be buying any more audio recordings with mixed narration. Should Pierce Brown write more in this series I will buy the ebooks but NOT the audiobook if Tim Gerrard Reynolds is not the ONLY reader.,My enjoyment of the story has suffered from the approach taken.,Think of Blood Song, first book single point of view from an amazingly crafted protagonist, the best book of its genre bar none. The next two were increasingly diabolical, complete change of style & focus to peripheral characters . This audiobook seems worse, since with the peripheral POV, you also lose Tim's amazing narration (who is the best in the business IMHO).,Nice story, only the female naration by Aedin Moloney is a constant dissonant. She sound like she‚Äôs in a chronic state of panic and anguish.,That‚Äôs all well and good when the character is actually in such a state, but not all the time...,rather glad thus is over. laboured story in places, descending into ancient world in space,Absolutely fantastic as usual.  New narrators element is fresh.  Lyria‚Äôs part is ok just when she does make parts they‚Äôre poorly done and takes you out of story.,The constant changing of narrators was annoying. Anti climax to an awesome series.,Tim should have finished it on his own.,Don't bother with this book if you enjoy the narrator. They have ruined it with multiple bad narrators.,Do not let other comments about different narrators hold you back from this book. The 4 different characters, stories, converge beautifully. I think it is also the best way for the author to continue after 3 powerful novels. There is lots going on in the worlds now and it is fitting to see 'hear' from alternate views. Listen my goodman, listen now, it gory damn prime.,As always I love the red raising series. only this time it has 3 more narrators. it took me some time to get use to and they all had different pace in their speech I had to slow down some of the narrators. Lyria's narrator was a bit too passionate... I really enjoyed the original narrator.,I love the story. This book adds another layer of depth into all of yhe characters. I feel like the book is growing darker and darker.,i cant wait for the next book.,Audio was too quiet, had keep volume twice as loud in my car,  also the narration for lycandar wasn't good, as if he was just reading of acting in character.  Story was good,  smart and nature follow up to a post revolution world. Pierce is still really good at screwing over his characters :),Darrow's narrator says ""Sir-vo"" a few times. he hasn't done this in the past.,Lysanders narrator always calls Roke ""Rock"" instead of ""R-oak"" bit annoying.,I was a bit wary of where or how the story would progress after the finale of the original trilogy. However, this is a very enjoyable read and definitely worth the credit. My only complaint is that the narrator for Lysanda seems to rush through his lines rather than spending it on inflection and pause. The other three narrators did brilliantly, with a special mention to Lyria's performer.,Levels up in the original trilogy. An astonishing achievement by a master of the craft.,A good addition to the series, the narration was really good in this one.,Great story that leaves me wanting more from the entire red rising series.,Fabulous cast with compelling performances"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Book 6","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"Jim Dale continues his masterpiece of narration, drawing the reader on, not as some storytellers do with a tone of gathering round the fire for a great tale, rather, as though seeing, experiencing each moment through the eyes of Harry, Dumbledore, and even Snape (ProFESSOR Snape, Harry!). Having now Audibled (yes, that's a verb in our house) 6 of the 7 Potter books back to back (I'm binge-listening much the way I binge-read the books 12 years ago) I am utterly gobsmacked at Mr. Dale's tireless energy, emotion, pacing and character throughout this series. Every voice distinct, the children's voices maturing in style and tone over the years, the adults remaining flawlessly consistent and true. These recordings are a treasure for any HP fan, and will transport (or rather reapparate) you to that magical realm of Hogwarts, Quidditch pitches, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and Privet Drive.  Thank you to Ms Rowling for making these favorites available to the Audible audience. And Bravo, Mr Dale.,‚ÄúIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.‚Äù,‚Äï J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Probably my favorite book in the series. I think this is JK Rowling at the peak of her writing, confidence, and strength. She is dealing with older protagonists and deeper, darker themes. She is dealing with themes of treachery, loss, etc.. All things that are usually dealt with in adult novels, but glossed over in YA fiction. While the literary pedant in me will sometimes cringe at her numerous clich√©s, there still exists a place where I'm able to ignore the rough patches that a good editor might have corrected, but these are small peeves; similar to the irritations I feel for Star Wars. Speaking of Star Wars, THIS would be JK Rowling's 'Empire Strikes Back.' The best in the series.,When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.,,Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.,,Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle‚Äîthe boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.,,Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle‚Äôs teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord‚Äôs weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore‚Äôs own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry‚Äôs‚Äîand Hogwarts‚Äôs‚Äîfuture in shadow.,,Jim Dale has done an exceptional job with the narrations of the Harry Potter series. His narratives only get better and better with each book.,#Magic #Potter #Adventure #Tagsgiving #Sweepstakes,I am 11 years old and I absolutely love this book,The narrating in this book is amazing kudos to the narrator Jim Dale each character has a different voice! and of course the story is very enjoyable and that goes for all the books by J. K. Rowling,HBP is one of my favorite in the Harry Potter series.  JK Rowling delivers drama, suspense, laughs, tenderness, and heartbreak.  Kid‚Äôs series?  Not at all. The plot over the series is complex, surprising, enthralling.  Jim Dale is a wizard of a whole different kind, bringing the story to life with wonderful voices and conveyance of emotion for the characters we love.  I could not recommend his work more.,I've always loved these books, and I am so glad that they have FINALLY come to audible.  Such adventure, and fun!,I love all the voices Jim Dale does. This book is a lot better as an Audiobook! All and all, loved it,very addictive book series.  great details, plot, and phenomenal narrator.  I would recommend the entire series!,The best narrative ever! He does voices for everyone. It makes it so much fun!,‚ÄúLet us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.‚Äù,‚Äï J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Story:  This was always my favorite of the movies and the book certainly doesn't dissapoint!  The plot continues to thicken and this particular book finally gets into some of the darkest aspects of the entire series.  The character development is great and the story, like the other books, is beautifully descriptive, detailed and captivating.  I found myself deeply invested in the struggles of Harry, Malfoy and the other characters.  This book really gets a lot of emotions from the reader/listener.,Narration: I gave this 4 stars as I didn't think all the voices were fantastic.  I'm sure I missed this in the previous books since I was so into the story, but it's become clear that some of the female voices just aren't nearly as strong as the male voices.  Luna and Ginny stand out, but I believe there was another female character in there that fell short of what I would have expected.  Aside from that, the other characters and the way Jim Dale captures the emotions is great!,Overall:  Half-Blood Prince is simply phenomenal.  This book does a great job of explaining so, so much about the entire series.  It also builds up to the final book which I've never read, but I'm sure will be amazing.  I'm a fan of this book in particular as it gets darker; you can feel the struggle and emotions of the characters and it's thrilling!  A great novel and a great addition to the series."
Crystal World,"Hard Science Fiction,Military,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I've enjoyed this series as much, if not more, than some of B.V. Larson's others but, regrettably, it's getting a bit ""long in the tooth"" and fairly predictable. Some of the sub-plots were uninteresting because of their predictability and came across as filler material. The ending chapters were rushed and uninventive. They seemed like they were meant to be a way to end the series but also leave enough wiggle-room to continue later.,,While I enjoyed this series, I won't be continuing it.,Compared to the earlier books the last few are very short on world. They mostly take place on earth and are take a long time to lead up to a mission followed by the mission ending quickly with nothing really happening,This book was not up to par for the story line you can definitely do better!,I enjoy this series but this story felt like a throw away in the series.,You might think after 20 books the story of James McGill would be worn out and stale. Not so, I‚Äôm looking forward to the next one. So, B.V. Hurry up with 21!,Continuity between characters and the continuation of another great story. Always enjoy Mark Boyett‚Äôs voice characters and the continuing story always leaves you waiting for the next one in the series.,some of the voices were different, and the story really didn't go anywhere. Seemed like this was filler.,This has to be a masterpiece of narration Mark Boyett wow what a amazing job he does with this series! It‚Äôs hard not to like James McGill narcissistic adventures. It‚Äôs as good as it gets and he keeps getting you laughing through the whole book. I‚Äôm hoping we get a book taking him in to the galactic empires war next.,My only gripe is there was no ‚Äúass over tea kettle‚Äù to be heard in this book,,I love the dynamic duo of BV Larson and Mark boyett BV Larson's writing is amazing as always and Mark boyett pregnant the characters to life with unique voices for each one this story was riveting from start to finish it keeps you from everyone to put it down makes you find no excuses to get back to your book to stay up late until you finish and you still want more I can't wait for the next book I love this series if you haven't tried it or if you haven't heard this one in it you must get it now you will thank yourself for it,McGill - Delivers as always, non stop fun. Looking forward to the next book in this amazing series. Allot of opportunities for new plots üòä,Great book love the story and the book narration can‚Äôt wait for the next one I highly recommend this book and the rest of the book series ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüòÄüëç,Just when you settle and think it's going somewhere somewhat predictable.. Nope!,Raash (spelling?) was hilarious this book.,Really enjoyed it, can't wait for the next one!,Had a lot of fun listening to this new story with a contiunuation of the story from the series looking forward to the next one,After 20 of these books, it is fair to say; I‚Äôm rusted on. They just scratch an itch that sits in some juvenile part of my mind. There is so much wrong with them, but they successfully transport me into another universe. I love them... I enjoy them, and the thing that annoys me the most is reaching the end of each book and thinking that the lead character is getting dumber after each revive and that the authors n Xu book is almost a year away.,I don‚Äôt think the audio franchise will survive Mark Boyett leaving it. His voice is the voice of McGill (and in this book, you could hear the wear in his voice when he did other characters). Boyett isn‚Äôt Casy Kasem or Michael Jayston, but I‚Äôm beginning to appreciate him as if he was. In fact I‚Äôm convinced that no small part of my love affair with this series is directly Boyett. He just does the character so well.,My feeling in the last two or so books is that B.V Larson has been stumbling, and in this I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm on the money as this book, he‚Äôs flexing and building future storyline‚Äôs and they are becoming far more interesting. The limitations of a few key characters have been sidelined in this story and to be honest it was a nice respite. Allowing the development of some key characters for the greater story arc. Larson looks like he‚Äôs writing again rather than cruising along like a very competent SF hack.,If you‚Äôre a fan of the series, genre and oeuvre, then this was a burst of feel good fantasy that satisfies. I enjoyed it, but now I‚Äôll have to wait for the next audio book. If I can‚Äôt wait I‚Äôll go buy the paperback, but I think I‚Äôll miss Boyett voice. He gives the series a life that the writing sometimes doesn‚Äôt really exhibit. Together they have made a mighty radio series and I am definitely a fan.,Good story, with twists, tails and interactions to keep you entertained. Looking forward to the next instalment."
Queen of Shadows,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure,Epic,Quran Arabic",Teen & Young Adult,"First off, I should point out that yes, this is book four of the series, and I've read none of the previous three. Also, there's a good bit of Grimdark about this, with everyone doing or having done awful things, and mostly willing to do more awful things. And at the end, we have a resolution to the story within this book, but no resolution of the larger issues, and much more bad stuff to come in future volumes.,So, really, at some point, I should have been overcome with the desire to throw it against the wall, except for two things. One, it's the audiobook. Two, I loved it.,Aelin Galathynius (guessing on the spelling of the last name), rightful heir to the throne of Terrasen (another spelling guess) has quietly returned to Rifthold, the capital of the bitter enemy who killed her family and conquered her kingdom. She wants revenge on the King of Adarlan, but he's not the only target of her vengeance. She was hardly more than a child when she fled her family's killers, and she's just nineteen now, but she's packed a lot into those years. She trained as an assassin under Rifthold's king of the assassin's guild, under the name Celaena Sardothien. Part Fae herself and possessing Fae fire magic, she traveled to the Fae lands and learned the use of her magic there--and made a valuable friend in Prince Rowan. She's back now to rescue her friend and cousin General Aedion and her friend Prince Dorian. She needs to know if Chaol Westphal, captain of the guard, is still a friend. She's been through horrors, she has done horros, and she has more to face and do before she can hope for anything vaguely resembling peace.,This is a dark and bloody story, but I like Aelin, Rowan, Aedion, Chaol and his second, Nesryn, and  Aelin's old rival Lysandra. Along with the darkness and blood, Queen of Shadows has romance, male friendship, female friendship, and male-female friendship, all treated in adult, satisfying, compelling way. Because, as I mentioned, I've read none of the previous three books, there's a lot I was trying to pick up as the story went along, but Maas salted in enough background in unobtrusive ways that if I didn't always know exactly what was going on at first, I was picking up enough to enjoy continuing to listen.,Highly recommended.,I received a free copy of this audiobook from Audible in exchange for an honest review.,Fantastic continuation of the story. Each book just gets better and better.  I couldn't stop listening to it. The only negative is waiting for the next book.  Sarah J Maas is a very talented writer.,I couldn't wait for this book, and pre-ordered the day it was listed on Audible...,I won't go into as many details on this review as I usually might, because I don't want to get into too much that might ruin it for the fans of this series... BUT, I will say that we get to see Celaena's return to Rifthold, and there is nothing but constant battles, fights, secrets and past histories reveled, and everything that the readers of this series have been waiting for... AND THERE IS STILL MORE TO COME! Although I would say the series ended in a cliff hanger like some of the previous ones did, there is definitely MUCH more story to be told, and the book ends in such a way that we know that the story will continue.,TEASER: The fight between Celaena and the king is AWESOME!,All-in-all: YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!,Any additional comments?,This series has everything a fantasy reader desires! I literally couldn't take head phones off.  We finally get a stand off between the king and the assassin and it doesn't disappoint. I have found myself in love with the Wing leader too.  Can't wait to see how the final battle turns out.,I've noticed trends in a lot of the YA scifi books that I've read, particularly those with a strong female lead, and this one followed all of them.  It has the usual love story/triangle, and the usual rise from the lower class, and a strong female protagonist - which to be clear, I always enjoy, AND, this book still managed to give you a plot line to love, even though you've kind of heard it all before.,This one brought me back, I had lost a little hope in the last book, but this book brought me back to loving the story, and I've already set alerts on my phone to remind me to check when the next book will be released.,I cannot explain how much this series keeps getting better and better. This book gave me something that I never knew I was waiting for HAPPINESS! the whole book is just intense and action packed. So much happens and so much that I expected to happen and not to expect happen. True bliss! Now I cannot wait another year....ugh. üò¢,I wish I could give this book a million stars, because it deserves every single single one. The combination of Maas' elegant and exciting style of writing with Evan's brilliant narration will make one hard pressed to hit the pause button. Though I have loved all three previous books in this series, this one is my favorite by the tiniest margin. The reason for this is tied into the enormous level of skill that Maas possesses in creating a deep emotional attachment between the reader and characters. I have been rooting for Celaena Sardothien, now Queen Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, for years. I found her intriguing and fierce throughout Throne of Glass and Crown of Midnight. Then in Heir of Fire, I started to respect and admire the woman and queen she was becoming. I could go on and on, but for the sake of those reading this I will cut it short. This book, or rather series, is a must read for any true lover of the fantasy and even epic genres. There are a plethora of characters to love, hate, and never be able to quite make up your mind about. You will not regret the read or listen.,Sarah Mass gets better and better with each book of the series. A marvelously developed plot that continues to expand. Characters interesting and imperfect.  Just finished the second read!,So much happens in this book, the storyline, the characters, the relationship between the characters... Seriously, WOW! Can't say that I'd expected any of it. Authers who write books like this series are without a doubt geniuses, cunning, able to so gallantly create life-like characters. Characters that have faults and that continues to grow. Five stars easily!,I really love ToG. Book 1-3 were good but book 4...I‚Äôm done with this book.,I have all these audible books and I just had to write how amazing these books are a easy listen and a great story weaves with magic and witches and fire hearts it‚Äôs well narrated and even my partner enjoys listening to this and he is not a fiction fan :),The description is amazing and there are definitely some twists in this story!! This book will grip you!!,Love this book as much as all the others. Sets up the next book nicely.,I love aelin and aedion. I wish rowan was mode open but I love his silent broodiness,This book is amazing, I could hardly put it down! I love the characters more and more as I read this fantastic series. It gets better with every book! Praise to Sarah J. Maas for the extraordinary imagination, time and effort that has gone into writing this series! Amazing!,I just wish I could afford to listen to the rest of the series üòï,Awesome book couldn't stop listening to it. It gets better and better very good fantasy.,This book makes me feel for the characters.  The plot is intricate and surprising.  What more could you want.,I loved every single chapter the book keept me awake at night the narrator is the best I love her voice,I couldn't stop listening to this. The story line and the narration were absolutety superb.,I loved Heir of Fire so much but Queen of Shadows goes to another level! All of the characters development is phenomenal and Aelin and Rowan... EEEEEEE!,loved it Couldn't put it down ! Such a compelling read! Can""t wait for the next book in this series!,Gripping, story incredibly gets better and better! Off to start the next book now! Love it!,I absolutely loved it!! so cant wait for the next book!! Had me absorbed and wanting to know what happens next to them all, all the way through the book. was sad when the book ended and wasnt another one out yet to read.,It's a wonderful story, I found this book kept me on edge, I couldn't pause it üòÄ,Love the books first time reading after 15 years and plan to continue the serie,It‚Äôs been a LONG time since I have got so engrossed in a Saga. Each book so far has been Brilliant.,Onto book 5 now.,Great book. Just finished listening and my poor heart doesn‚Äôt know what to do with all these different emotions. So much pain and so much to celebrate. After binging the last couple books I‚Äôm going to take a beat to recover and reenter the real world as I know once I start the next book I will be entranced as though I‚Äôm wearing a ring myself.,One of the best series I have ever listened too! Narrating is superb and keeps to totally gripped the whole time! I will be very upset one I have finished!,This was my first re-read and BY THE WYRD it was brilliant! My favourite series by far."

"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Book 5","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"Of course I love the books and all things HP. Otherwise, why would I buy the audiobook!? Jim Dale is one of the best narrators that I've ever heard. He truly brings all the HP books to life with his voices for each character.,I am embarrassed to say that I have listened to the HP books more than once because it's such a joy hearing them read by Mr. Dale.,Jim Dale is spectacular, I feel like I hear each character when he is reading. I think he is the only one ever meant to read multi-character stories! J. K. Rowling keeps me wanting more! While the battle between good and evil grows stronger, as long as Harry's fighting for the good, I feel safe!,‚Äú...thoughts could leave deeper scars than almost anything else.‚Äù,‚Äï J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,The fifth novel in the series, the longest, and by this time one that emerges into a fully-formed Potter Mania. The first Harry Potter move was released in November 2001 and went on to make nearly $1B US worldwide. This was the first book to be released AFTER the movies started to drop. From now on, it was going to be difficult to think of Harry Potter without seeing Daniel Radcliff.,Part of the reason I love the audiobooks: Jim Dale's narration, and returning to them gives me an opportunity to return to the pre-movie version of Harry Potter where the books, character, and place exist in words and not pictures (well except now there are now illustrated versions of the Harry Potter series).,Epic saga continues to impress as to the imagination of the author.  A fantasy so real it's believable.  Jim Dale is the most amazing and talented narrator I've ever heard.  He has a gift for giving each character a voice and personality.,We all know the book is spectacular. No qualms there. But the audiobook made some strange choices with the recording and narration that really took me out of the story.,1. For the previous 4 books, Dale has pronounced ‚ÄúVoldemort‚Äù with a silent ‚ÄúT‚Äù in a very French manner. No issues there. Rowling herein has said that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs pronounced. But suddenly in this book Dale pronounces the T at the end VERY prominently.  It wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if it wasn‚Äôt SO inconsistent from the other readings he‚Äôd done. If you‚Äôre listening to all the books in order, it‚Äôs very jarring to hear everyone suddenly pronouncing the character‚Äôs name differently.,2. The voice he gave to Luna is so bizarre. It‚Äôs described as light and airy, but the voice he gives her sounds like that gruff uncle whose had too much to drink at the New Year‚Äôs Eve party.  It‚Äôs very distracting.,3.  I don‚Äôt know if this particular audiobook was rushed or something, but the editing is very odd in places. Randomly throughout the story, there will be an extremely long unnecessary pause in between paragraphs that leads you to believe the app crashed or something.,I‚Äôve been very impressed with Jim Dale‚Äôs performance and the audiobooks as a whole for the HP series up to this point, but I unfortunately have to say this one took a BIG step backwards for me. I hope the next one is as good as the previous ones.,The books just get better and better.   The narration is awesome. I find myself cheering  out loud when something good happens for Harry. LOVE these books,amazing book for mystery and fantasy lovers.I love it so much. it is really interesting.,This is a great Harry Potter book. I was always of the belief that the middle books (3, 4, 5) were the best because they explore more mature themes and have a darker tone. However, as compelling as the story for Order of the Phoenix is ‚Äî it is horribly bloated. There is too much padding that deviates from the main plot line of the book. This book would benefit greatly from trimming the fat. The book would be more streamlined, and the reader would be able to remain engaged in the main story rather than suffer through long periods of nothing happening. Unfortunately J.K. Rowling simply can‚Äôt resist her maximalist tendencies.,What a story, what a story, what a story. I'm commenting on this book but I'm talking about the series as a whole. This will go down as one of the best series ever written in our time. A truly great example of the wanders the human brain can conceive. Hats off and applause for j.k. Rowling creating something so thorough, and awe inspiring that I wouldn't be surprised if at some point in our lives this series turns out to be based on something going on that we are not currently aware of. A truly magical story (no pun intended but now that I mention it, it might as well be) that every child should read. Inspiring courage in the face of ever growing danger, friendship when it""s easy to go your separate ways, and fighting to the death and beyond for what you believe in. The movies pale in comparison to this work of art, and the story told is better suited to be drawn in your mind as opposed to a world bound by physical limitations. Jim dale brings the story to life in the most uncompromising of ways. He reads with the right amount of enthusiasm and is so good representing different characters it's as if there's a whole cast. A model story(series as a whole) and model voice performance. I will listen to this story again and again and again!,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not my favorite book in the series, Harry can get quite angsty, but it is still delivers great entertainment and is one of the most necessary books in the series.  Voldemort is back, clues to future events are hidden in the text, important events occur, important characters in the war are introduced, and key information is given.  Harry's story moves on dramatically and he grows up significantly, turning from angry, angsty, troubled, and misunderstood kid, to the character he must become to take on what lies before him.,As usual Jim Dale's narration is spot on. I'm always amazed at how he is able to create so many different characters and keep their voices consistent throughout the entire series.,After listening to these books on CD for years, and then having to rip each of the disks to the computer to be able to listen to them digitally, I'm extremely excited to be able to listen to one of my favorite series's so easily.  For a bit of comparison I pulled out those discs and found that this audiobook alone consisted of 23 separate discs consisting of 10 or more tracks each and cost $75 at the when it was first released."
A Clash of Kings,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Would you try another book from George R. R. Martin and/or Roy Dotrice?,Martin is incredible.  Great characters, fearless plot--no one is safe--and masterful pace/susupense.,Dotrice, on the other hand, has mastered all of maybe 3 different voices, and each of them is about as easy on your ears as broken glass mixed with sandpaper.,Would you be willing to try another one of Roy Dotrice‚Äôs performances?,I may not even listen to the rest of these novels simply BECAUSE Dotrice is involved.,Would you listen to A Clash of Kings again? Why?,No. I seldom listen to books more than once.,Who was your favorite character and why?,Tyrion Lannister. Obvious underdog, bullied his whole life. He's coming up in the world and doing big things. Will he stay humble? It seems like a question Tyrion would ask himeself.,That's why I like the character so much.,Who would you have cast as narrator instead of Roy Dotrice?,Roy does 2 or 3 voices voices very well.,But! his females all sound like toothless old crones in pirate movies. Even the young beautiful ones.,The remainder of male characters sound like grumpy Leprechauns. I'm not joking. They really do. It's getting quite old and it's very disappointing.,That said Roy has the perfect amount of drama. His voice is excellent for reading the back story. You find yourself lost in the story till it comes time to narrate a female part. Then he snaps you out of it like being awakened from a sleep by a power saw in your bedroom.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,37 hours N/A.,Any additional comments?,Just finishing up book 2. Already bought book 3.,I'm excited about the series and will be more than ready to move on after book 3.,Regardless of how it leaves me hanging.,Any additional comments?,The first audiobook (Game of Thrones) has chapter breaks that coincide with where they would be in the physical book.  These breaks are timed out, and so happen at random points in the story.  Even the four ""parts"" of the book break mid-chapter.,It would be a better listening experience if the breaks happened at an appropriate chapter break.,Roy Dotrice again, simply great at what he does....,The twists and turns in the book is simply great and I am loving how the characters are very slowly but purposely being developed. The book has three different stories running as one it seems and it weaves together very well. Just plain impressive.,Overall... Just plain epic!,What did you like best about A Clash of Kings? What did you like least?,Martin's series is grand and ambitious in its scope, and that is simultaneously its blessing and its curse.  The writing is strong, but the pace of the story is at once somehow quick, drawing the ear to the next page, and painfully slow.  His use of different perspectives to tell the story is refreshing, but there are certain characters that it seems should be added to that list who remain absent, while some characters can grow simply tiresome at times.  Nonetheless, if you're here for more of what you got in ""A Game of Thrones"", you'll find plenty.,That being said, Dotrice's narration is, to say the least, a mixed bag.  Some characters, mainly the older male characters, are given excellent voices.  Similarly, the voice he uses to narrate the general text itself is deliberate and clear.  That being said, the list of characters who are nearly destroyed by his flamboyant voicing is long and unfortunate.  He miserably fails at voicing literally every female character in the book, especially Brienne of Tarth and Mellisandre, and he manages to butcher most of the younger characters, including Theon Greyjoy and Bran Stark.  His most distracting and consistent failures come with two of the most important characters, Tyrion Lannister (who is given to sound like a shamefully caricatured leprechaun) and Lord Varys, whose sloppy annunciation and unmstakeable lisp are a shame to Mr. Dotrice and an absolute failure to grasp the character.  Also worth mention are his terrible performances as Hodor the stableboy and Yoren the black brother.  With Hodor the failure is less distracting, since he only says one word anyway, but Yoren is consistently annoying and hard on the ear in every scene.,Nonetheless, the writing is strong enough that a careful listener can work around the narration.  I would recommend this recording of this book, but be aware of what you're getting yourself into beforehand.,What other book might you compare A Clash of Kings to and why?,More important, I think, are the books I would not compare it to.  Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Heinlein's works and essentially all other rote fantasy material is not fundamentally comparable.  Often, the books read more like a novelized, fictionalized history of Scotland or England, and that's a compliment.  Martin understands the kind of society he's mimicking, and as such he manages to write what is mostly a political novel with fantasy elements, rather than a fantasy novel with politics.,Would you be willing to try another one of Roy Dotrice‚Äôs performances?,I will, but *only* because his is the only available narration of these books.  Otherwise, I would not be caught dead listening to another of his performances.,Did A Clash of Kings inspire you to do anything?,Keep reading the series.,I love the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series so much that I have read the books three times and now have listened to the audio books as well.  Martin is very skilled at drawing you into the story; he moves the plot(s) along at varying paces, sometimes slow, even plodding and sometimes he hits you over the head with a war hammer.  At it's heart, the story is one of schemes within schemes, Machiavellian intrigues, lust, murder, greed, envy, deception, betrayal and all the other good human virtues :-). The fantastical elements within the story don't overwhelm; they merely add another flavor. Although as the plots of the first books unfold, the power of magic is growing, as supernatural events seem to be increasing in power and frequency.   This will be even more apparent in the third book, ""A Storm of Swords"".  Roy Dotrice is amazing as the reader for the audiobook. You may know him as Mozart's father in the Movie ""Amadeus"".  Dotrice does a brilliant job of capturing the personalities of old crones, young children, gruff knights, pitiable beggars, and a host of others.  Nothing beats a long drive and these audiobooks to keep you company. What am I saying, I listen to them at home as well because I don't want the story to end.  I can't wait for the next audiobook, only so I can enter the world again while I wait for ""A Feast for Crows"" to get published.  If you enjoy Tolkien, Robert Jordan, or other epic fantasy series, you will fall in love with this.  It's simply the best series being written today, and deserves a place in the short list of great epic fantasy tales.,Any additional comments?,This whole series is well worth the time and the money. Once you start its all consuming. if you dont dream about it when you finally go to sleep, then your not paying attention.,George R. R. Martin continues his epic tale filled with greed, passion, intrigue, and war.  If you are a veteran of A Game Of Thrones then you'll have learned to expect the unexpected; surprising plot twists and turns and a sort of literary brutality with the fates of his characters put Martin well above the fluff-writing fantasy authors infesting bookshelves today.  You'll go through the full gamut of emotions before you're done and, tired and weary, you'll be left wanting more. The narration by Roy Dutrice is phenomenal--his myriad voices and accents and seasoned, gruff voice is perfect for Martin's grim, realistic writing. Now, there are many people who don't like Martin's penchant for making the ""good"" characters suffer for their ignorance and lack of ruthlessness.  There are many people who don't like Martin's realistic take on villians and how bad people with lots of power can do really bad things.  There are many people who don't like seeing the characters that they've invested their emotions in get killed or have worse happen to them (yes, worse.) If you are one of these people. then go read something else that will fill your hearts with kittens and butterflies and chocolate chip ice cream.  To everyone else: Strap yourselves down because you're in for one heck of a ride.,Any additional comments?,Great story but the narration is really distracting. The narrator makes everyone sound like a dim-witted toothless old man, even the women. I listened less and less and ended up just reading the book since the audio took so much away from my enjoyment of this excellent read.,Would you say that listening to this book was time well-spent? Why or why not?,I've gotten drawn into this series well enough that I'm most of the way through Book 3, but by the end of this, Book 2, I was feeling a little like I wanted 80-something hours of my life back. I do enjoy most of the story lines, but I find the plot arch so brutal in its scope, I am not sure I can hold out for another 4 books or whatever to find out if whichever of these characters finally survive will get any kind of justice in the end.,The good characters generally have horrid lives that only get worse and worse (with occasional moments of hope that are often soon dashed!), while the bad characters rarely get any sort of just rewards. And in a normal novel, you only have to wait 10-20 hours or so to know the ending, but this saga is so vast, you will not get any such satisfaction. You will wait years to know for sure if the poor characters you've come to love will suffer anything but awful fates, and while I'd like to believe--since this is pop fiction--that the author won't let us down in the end, I am not so sure after seeing several central and beloved characters killed to serve the larger plot.,I know people are wild about this series in general, but as a non-fantasy reader I'm not sure if these are genre-transcending books. More like, they're good fantasy books that appeal to fantasy readers more than they will appeal to a general audience. I bought the books after reading so many positive reviews, and after several recommendations from friends. Speaking as a non-fantasy reader, I do really enjoy that there's not a great deal of magic or non-human characters in the stories, while there is enough to create an interesting atmosphere. The world-building is very skillfully done.,However I don't know if I have the fortitude for much more bloodshed, beheadings, and killing off of characters who never get to see any kind of justice for all their suffering.,,I've listened/read this book several times with each pass offering more details missed previously. Roy Dotrice amazes me with his ability to imitate so many different characters voices. Truly astonishing from the story by George to the narration by Roy. Thank you for the mastery."
Princes of Ash,Romantic Suspense,Romance,"As always, check your triggers with this duo. I really liked the story of the Princes and their Princess. Probably because I have a bit of a 'breeding' kink, and this definitely was that.  The story was, like I said, hot and dirty, and as usual with this series, major drama and punishments.,I am a huge Jake Bardeaux fan, however, I am done with Bridgette. Her tone and inflections NEVER change throughoutthe entire book!  Whether she's in the throws of passion, in misery and trauma, or talking about the weather, she sounds like the end of the world is coming.  I made it through the first Prince's book, I'll finish this one, but any more in this series I'd rather have Alexa read it to me. I'm sorry Bridgette, you'd be amazing if your tones and inflections changed depending on the circumstances occurring.  ""/,Man the way these books end on cliffhangers is a freaking crime but geezlouise I ca‚Äôt wait till the next one. I looked it up and it says 2024  is when the next one will be released. When I say I almost threw the phone. Yeah it was that serious üò©,I love this series!!! Angel and Sam really put their all in this book. I like how they tie all the books up in this one so even though it‚Äôs different frat the events that have happened still come up from other books. Omg and the mystery of who the father is to Verity‚Äôs baby and who Paces mom and just all of it was AMAZING . I can‚Äôt wait to read the next book when it comes out."
Empire of Storms,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure,Epic",Teen & Young Adult,"I've noticed trends in a lot of the YA scifi books that I've read, particularly those with a strong female lead, and this series follows all of them. It has the usual love stories, and the usual rise from the lower class, and a strong female protagonist - which to be clear, I always enjoy, AND, this book still managed to give you a plot line to love, even though you've kind of heard it all before.  This particular book shows how much Aelin Galathynius has grown and how strong she truly is.,This book was extremely sexual, more so than any of the books prior, and I would not recommend it for the 11-13 age group.  There were many sex scenes and sexual conversation and situations, so I think parents should use their own judgement.,I'm thrilled with this book, I wish I waited until the next book in the series was also released, because this is a doozy.,Most of this series is brilliant, the vibrant world, interesting characters, and struggle for hope are parts that have kept me enjoying this series. This book however added some things that I really didn't like, and think detracted from the overall story. I believe there are times and places where sex scenes can be appropriate but many of the scenes depicted in the book felt like cheap smut, placed there as fan service to keep people interested in the books. it could have been more enjoyable if left to the imagination and not depicted in such a graphic and vivid way. The only other main issue I had was a 30 minute torture scene. It was placed to cause tension and build anticipation, but lasted far too long. The way it was handled caused me to loose all interest in the book or the outcome of the series.,The series as a whole is a good one, and one that have enjoyed. I would, however, not recommend this particular book to others. It just isn't my flavor.,I appreciate how the author finally brought all the characters together and explained mysteries from her series.   However I do not understand why she chose to be so sexually explicit with all of her characters.   It didn't even seem to fit in certain places.  She went from one overly lusty scene to the next, almost as if she got stuck and couldn't think of how to progress she story so she had all of her characters be fully and uncontrollably horny.   It didn't make sense in context and seemed cheap and trashy.  Besides her brief attempt at being an erotica writer, I liked this book.,I loved the story but cringed through all of the detailed sex scenes and explosion of explitives. Aelin's toes curl a lot, and everybody is ""incarnate"". (I dont know if that name is spelled right. Im more of an audio listener.) I hope Sarah tones down the adult content in her next books, or I wont be buying any more copies in the throne of glass series for my kids to stumble over.,I really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn't due to the graphic sex.,Empire of storm is  great story and I look forward to the next release.  I have to say Aelin is just so lovable and she has won my heart.  She is beautiful, smart , so giving.  She is  willing to scare her life so others may live. She is amazing.,,I highly recommend this book.  This book is full of adventure.  Aelin may sound so full of herself; but she is full of love for the people and causes that she loves.,Rowan, Doran, Manon, Aedion and Lorcan  are also great characters.   I like the way we were able to her different characters POV.,I don't think this book is appropriate  for kids as young as 11-13.  I do think that there are parts of the book which are not appropriate for kids which are that young.,An applause to Sarah Mass and Elizabeth Evans.  Good job.,I can see this series book becoming a tv show or movie.,I've mostly enjoyed this series so far. But this is the first time I've found myself pressing the fast forward button. The author just spends way too much time describing sex. I mean, this is not a romance novel, right? But it seems like she wanted to make it one. Some good story development does happen in the book--actually a lot does get explained--but the story, in my opinion, could have been a lot better if someone had cut the sex scenes down to one-tenth their lengths. At this point, I would not bother reading the next book if it is like this one. This one was just too disappointing, as I felt I just could not enjoy it.,Loved the story, great plot with great characters.,However, it seemed like the author thought she needed wildly graphic sex scenes (this also in her other book series Court of Mist and Fury) to create intimacy between characters.  Totally unnecessary, especially for a young adult novel.  Something I would never recommend for the young and impressionable.,I read the previous volumes of the series and although there was a few spots but I fast-forward, the excessive amounts of swearing and graphic sexual interaction was unacceptable.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,Spend time on developing the story and leave out the unnecessary detailed descriptions of sex between characters,Has Empire of Storms turned you off from other books in this genre?,No,Which scene was your favorite?,NA,What reaction did this book spark in you? Anger, sadness, disappointment?,NA,Any additional comments?,Very disappointed in the direction the author decided to take with this book. This book seems to be more about the sex and descriptions of it than the story.  I will discontinue this series and return this for credit. I know many may disagree but the focus on sex and the descriptions of it is and unnecessary addition to this book.,These books are great, but I'm sure you're aware of that if you've got to this point. What I really wanted to mention is the voice actor for this series is phenomenal. She captures the tone, essence, and voices of the characters and story. I've not come across a better narrator than this one here.,Any additional comments?,\i have now invested days listening to this series with my 14 year old daughter. she will not be listening to this final book as the prolonged sexual scenes are very graphic and would not be suitable. I am very disappointed as the actually add nothing to the story line.,After completing this serise, I found it brilliantly written and the narration is superb, the whole serise is brilliant, I can't fault it so all.,I would most definitely recommend this serise to anyone.,It's an epic 5 star fantasy.,the narrator is really easy to listen to and the storyline catches you every twist and turn literally nonstop action I can't wait for the next book it's going to be epic üëç,I can't wait to listen to the next book. Captivating story full of emotions, bravery, love and friendship, pain and suffering, pride and loyalty, humour and wisdom. Fantasy offering escape but at the same time teaching the values of right conduct, moral and ethical decision making.,Third time reading/listening to this book and it just gets better each time. Inspiring heroine and wonderful characters throughout. I can't wait for the next few books of the series!,I love Sarah J Maas - end of! These books are epic and the delivery is always top notch!,Good twists, voices are a bit similar, quite angsty. Looking forward to last book. Probably won't relisten.,,narrator was great as usual but story is losing it's way now. dissapointed in this book as the others were much better.,Would you consider the audio edition of Empire of Storms to be better than the print version?,I haven't read the print version but I have read the other books in the series and have really struggled with them. The audiobook had me hooked!,A lot of plot filling and people saying 'gods damn' and not a lot of interesting story. Honest, if they took out every 'gods damn' the book would be half as long. Not sure I'll continue with the series anymore.,This book broke me, the emotions I went through reading it. Just wow!!,,This book is a great fantasy read. I was hooked from the start and devoured every word. A great read, I really enjoyed it.,twists, turns and action as thrilling as the previous books but I found this one to be much too graphic at the intimate scenes. less is more. but with 4 romantic storylines on the go all in one book the cringeworthy depth of description was hard to avoid.,A tad slow to start, but oh my wyrd, that ending. I'm in tears. I also loved that there was less swearing in this one. There's also a lot more sex,  but they've been building up to it for the last four books, so not unexpected.. it's easily skipped if you're so inclined..,Aaarrgh! The not wanting it to be over versus the wanting to know what happens.,Sadly now I have to wait for the next one.,I could stop listening. Loved it, love the series. I think I might have to start at the beginning again.,read the series! read the series! read the series! the 5th book empire of storms has so many moments that i was shocked or raging or whooping or blushing in. i feel like I've run a marathon. How can one book make you feel all the feels!?,highly recommend.,What a story! There are many series where you feel there are too many books that aren‚Äôt needed. Too many you wish would just get to the point. This is not one of them. I cannot stop reading/listening to this series! I read on Kindle and have the accompanying audible for most books for when I‚Äôm driving or doing motherly/house duties. This narrator does an absolutely fantastic job at reading this story. Not only does she get the plot across, she perfectly executes the different personalities and emotions in each everyone‚Äôs speech. You know exactly who is speaking and what emotions are being drawn. The story alone is worth a read. I have one last book to read in this series and I am sad that it will be over. I am so invested to know how this will play out and if the prophecies that have come to light will play out or if, somehow they‚Äôll fight them. Well done to Elizabeth Evans and Sarah J Mass. You are a splendid pair in this series!,Could not stop listening!,Definitely my favourite out of the series so far. The narrator is excellent! On to book 6, so  pumped!,Loved it. Was a great build up and the series just seems to get better and better. Looking forward to reading more of your books too, hope is all we need."

This contains 50 short stories, which is an excellent value for your credit. There are two caveats, however. The first is that David Suchet, well known for playing Poirot on television, does NOT narrate all the stories. This is a shame because he's an excellent actor and for many people, like me, he is Hercule Poirot. The other narrators just aren't as good, and they do impact the enjoyment of the stories. The second issue is that some of the stories are very ""slight"" this is especially true, with the stories which take the labors of Hercules as their inspiration. I don't think David Suchet narrates any of these, and that just makes them worse. All that said, the stories narrated by Suchet are well worth a credit, and some of the weaker stories are good, just not as good as some of the others.,Apart from some nitpicking below, this is a collection well worth the reader's time and money.,,Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories is a compilation of five earlier audio collections -- 1) The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding and Other Stories , 2) The Labours of Hercules, 3) Murder in the Mews and Other Stories, 4) Poirot investigates, and 5) Poirot's Early Cases --  and ""Yellow Iris"".,,These are NOT the ""complete"" short stories of Hercule Poirot.  MISSING are:,1)  ""The Submarine Plans""  --  originally published in 1923 and reworked in 1937 as ""The Incredible Theft"" (which is published in this collection) .,2)  ""The adventure of the Christmas Pudding""  -- originally published in 1923.  It was reworked in 1963 using the same title and that reworked short story is published in this collection under title: ""The Theft of the Royal Ruby"".,3)  ""The second gong"" -- originally published in 1932 and reworked in 1937 under title: ""Dead man's mirror"" (which is published in this collection).,4)   ""Poirot and the Regatta Mystery"" -- originally published in 1936 and reworked in 1939 (but WITHOUT Hercule Poirot) under title ""The Regatta Mystery"".,5)   ""The Mystery of the Spanish Chest"" -- published in 1960 and was a reworking of ""The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest"" originally published in 1932 (which is published in this collection).,,It is advertised as 'more than 50 stories'.  That is misleading.  There are fifty short stories and two forewords in this collection.  I do not count the foreword to the whole collection and the foreword to The Labours of Hercules as short stories.,,Lastly, I am unable to identify any short story in this collection as read by Isla Blair.,I awaited the release of this compilation for many, many months and the overall collection is just excellent.  The key narrators David Suchet and Hugh Fraser are jus excellent.  At times, the narrators are change such as with the Murder in the Mews.  Very disappointing.  It's a great story destroyed by the gasping of the narrator.  The depiction of Poirot and Japp sound like they are gasping for a breath.  Really disappointing.,As a teenager, I enjoyed reading Agatha Christie's short stories. These fifty Poirot stories -- short stories and novellas -- provide many hours of entertainment by the master of method and order whose ""little grey cells"" make sense out of improbable situations. Truly worthwhile for Hercule Poirot fans.,I love David Suchet!!,I grew up with Focus on the Family radio drama. They have done the Chronicles of Narnia with Suchet as Aslan. I have recent fallen in love with Poirot. He‚Äôs definitely the best Poirot. Really elegant. Reminds me of a normal Monk. At least what I imagine Monk would by like when Trudy was alive.,I've always been a fan of her stories and this collection doesn't disappoint.  The narrations are great and to the enjoyment of each story.,I understand that these books were written a hundred years ago, pretty much when the prime and mystery genre was just picking up speed... But Sherlock Holmes was written decades before Hercule Poirot was, and at least Sherlock explains how he came to his answers... Half of the time when parole is explaining how he came so I can close in, he just discredit to his little gray cells and doesn't do any of the footwork of finding facts and motives and in no way explains how he came to the conclusion... That's about 95% I love the excitement of reading mystery and crime novels, you know what the crime was, but you want to know who did it and how... Parole tells you who did it and when he explains how he figured it out, he just says that he thought about it for a while using his little grey cells in the answer came to him ... Umm, I'm calling BF, at least on the TV series David suchet explains how he, as parole, figured everything out,34+ hours of Poirot magic especially delightful when narrated by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser and a gracious prologue by Charles Todd.,While Hercule Poirot has been compared to Sherlock Holmes - both are excellent detectives, and I don‚Äôt wish to debate who‚Äôs better - I prefer Holmes more than Poirot for one major reason: evidence over speculation. In many of this book‚Äôs short stories, Poirot has the case figured out speedily, but it is based on guesses, not necessarily evidence, and the rest of his investigations, especially when evidence appears, are confirmations of what today‚Äôs judicial system would call speculations. Perhaps, I cannot yet wrap my head around some stories, but each one is entertaining, and Agatha Christie did a great job of beautifully hiding Waldo in a gorgeous landscape!,The narrators were marvelous, with various accents, slurred or quick speech, and easily identifiable emotions with every sentence. Truly, a wonderful job, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll listen to these stories again!"
Never Finished,Motivation & Self-Improvement,Business & Careers,"Mr.Goggins changed my young life at 20 years old with his first book. Two years later I‚Äôm now an emt, left my home town/state and am applying to different police departments and have testing dates coming up within the month. I went from a sad child to a disciplined young man at 22 years old. Two years of routine exercise, no excuses, and mental toughness not only saved me but made me the person I always wished to be. Thank you Mr.Goggins.,David Goggins is without a doubt one of the baddest men to walk the earth! It‚Äôs what made the first book so unbelievably great. A true underdog story, in comparison this fell flat vs You Can‚Äôt Hurt Me.,It‚Äôs mostly about his Ultra career and the trials and tribulations of them grueling competitions. If you like that you‚Äôll probably like this book, personally I have no interest in Ultra Racing and while I appreciate the sport and the mindset needed, it got very old three hours in. Then the book hammered it home for another eight hours.,I should of known when he‚Äôs literally running on the cover, that‚Äôs the entire book. All running related and instead of running on broken legs this time it‚Äôs on broken knees. I don‚Äôt mean that in a light way, you just expect that from the ‚Äúsavage‚Äù that is Goggins.,The book is titled ‚ÄúNever Finished,‚Äù it felt like that as well‚Ä¶ it was never going to finish. A slog and a half, maybe David is putting calluses on our minds to get through this one?,Not a total loss, he has some great lines in here and the interview podcast with his mother might be worth the price of admission alone. Him not narrating the book when his name is listed first in the narrated by feels like a cheap shot. He dropped the ball, don‚Äôt list your name first when you did less then 5% of the narration.,I would personally pass and do not recommend this book, my time would of been better spent relistening to his first book, ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Hurt Me.‚Äù,,Halfway through and that same drive has crept back into my life after I read Can‚Äôt Hurt me in 2019.  I needed this book so badly right now.  The world needed David Goggins and didn‚Äôt even know it until his first book.  Well done David, you are the people‚Äôs champ that taught us we all have a champion inside.,This book is going to be another listen to over and over again! I am only half way through and have already received golden nuggets #stayhard üí™üèΩ congratulations David on another New York best seller!,Goosebumps after the first 20 minutes. I‚Äôm so excited to get back after life. Haven‚Äôt felt like this since his last book.,David Goggins is exactly what I needed to get back to being dominant. This guy speaks the truth that you don‚Äôt want to hear.,Do yourself and everyone you love the favor and buy this. It will change your life.,Can't Hurt Me came to me in a really rough stretch in my life in 2019. This year there's been a lot of doubt creep back up. I feel like knocking down walls again after this first listen üò∏ Thank you sir!,The best of the best.  David Goggins did it again!  This is the second evolution to his first one, Can't Hurt Me.  A must read that will get you to find your inner Goggins.,People wanted to hear Goggins narrate his own book not this guy. Major disappointment! Goggins fumbled the ball here.,I‚Äôm a big Goggins fan but I was not impressed with this book.,The whole thing is narrated by this Adam guy with an annoying high pitched nasal voice and accent and I couldn‚Äôt help wondering why David Goggins didn‚Äôt make the effort to read his book for his audience?,If you are going to get someone else to narrate it at least get someone with a tol√©rable voice.,Also not sure why but I found the content tiresome and nothing new, heard it all before and sometimes it comes across a bit fake and sad - ‚ÄúI am the greatest man who ever lived I am so badass I am so hardcore‚Äù - ok we get it man, good for you - lighten up!,I was skeptical that Goggins would be able to strike gold twice, it's hard to match or even outperform your first best seller, but he's done it.,Lots of amazing advice on how to realize your untapped potential and the incredible cost it takes to turn your life around. If you're down and out, this book will connect deeply with you.,This book isn't about getting getting rich, having a bigger house or ridiculous hustle culture. It's about becoming at peace with yourself by facing your demons and taking back control of your life.,God-gins has done it again. I‚Äôm ready to run around the world with my top off.,This is not a ordinary self help book full of bullshit. This is propaly the best book ever written on how to create mental toughness. Love the narrative,It‚Äôs like listening to that person at work, if you ran one mile, they ran two, if you did 40 press ups they did 41.,Should come with an ego warning. Also sounds like he has psychological problems. Alter egos etc,A bit gutted I used a credit on this. Big fan of Goggins but after listening to him on a podcast I was under the impression he narrated the story. He read the intro and says a few words. The podcasts in the book with him are okay but better to listen to a normal podcast.,David's second book is another testament to his greatness and hardcore attitude of never give up. In this book we learn a bit more about the important characters in his life that gave him discipline and a savage mentality. The interview with his mother is very enlightening to understand domestic abuse and how it is possible to escape to achieve greatness. We also learn about the many recent healrh struggles that David went throug since the publication of his first book and his new carreer goals. He is trully unstoppable and a very admirable hero. Superb reading.,Goggins is the best example that we can change our lifes! He is awesome and a mentor for myself!,listened for about two hours, nothing more than self boasting, not my cup of tea.,I've heard a lot about Mr Goggins but to be honest this book isn't half as good as his interviews. I found the book boring and uninspiring.,I‚Äôm sure this is a great wake-up call for some.,I do suggest that David reads and researches trauma, and how it can play out in your life. A good starting point is the book ‚Äúwhat happened to you‚Äù, and there are many more detailed books.,I believe that the excruciating pain that David puts himself through is a trauma response. It‚Äôs similar to self harm such as cutting etc, where he actually gets a thrill and ‚Äòfeels alive‚Äô from it. It‚Äôs his way of coping with his past, but not the healthiest way for all of us obviously.,The lack of love, respect, connection in his childhood is clearly evident in the way he is living his life and through his relationships now. So I took this book as a case study, rather than a ‚Äòhow to live my life‚Äô lesson.,Overall, thank you for your bravery and honesty. Your courage and discipline is definitely great motivation for many people, including myself. But please keep learning and challenging yourself emotionally xxxx,Seemed to be same and similar stories from his first book. Didn‚Äôt light a fuse like the first book but theirs some stuff to take away from it.,I can't listen anymore, 3hrs to go I can't handle any more of Davids's voice!  He is entirely self-absorbed and it's all about his relentless injuries and how he thinks he is better than everyone else. I think this book was written as therapy for himself.  It would be a great read if David toned it down a little.,I‚Äôm a 74yo who read/listened Can‚Äôt Hurt Me and was inspired to start walking. Now I‚Äôve read/listened to Never Finished and inspired AGAIN!!! To continue-even though I‚Äôve had a fall-Is my main goal in the rest of my life!!! THANKYOU DAVID GOGGINS!! You inspire SOOO MANYüôèüôè God Bless You FOREVER üôèüôè,Such a great read, listened to the whole this today. Right up there with ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt hurt me‚Äù. Stay hard!,After listening to Cant Hurt Me , I was honestly convinced that the sequel to the audiobook could not be beaten given the massive impact it made on my life, having when from borderline obesity to becoming a marathon runner (with more to go in the future). This audiobook is definitely another step up and David does not fail to deliver the message we regular people all need to hear, and he does this by sharing the raw and real about his expwriences without any sugarcoating whatsoever. Through David's humility and admittance that he began as a broken person to become who he is today, it  gives someone like me, a regular person who isn't extremely talented at anything, a powerful realization that there is one other way to achieving a fulfilled life , and while the journey ahead will be long, bumpy and arduous, I have yet once again - thanks to the author and narrator of this book learned something very important that will stay with me forever. I will extensively on a day by day basis be treating the Evolutions of this book like a textbook for the biggest test of them all, which is the test of life. I would strongly recommend buying this asap, if you are still trying to ""figure it out"".,Loved it and listened when I was running.  I was genuinely sad when it finished mid-run!  Goggins has clearly matured and this book speaks to all audiences, not just those drawn to military inspiration.,Needed this right at this point in my life.,It along with can‚Äôt hurt us is fuel to better myself for me and my family.,Waited all day for this!, this is the best dam literature or words spoken by the human species since WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. Truely a book that is a feat of human evolution!. I own Harry poster, lord of the ring, Stephen king, all the sled help books and this is the BEST thing iv ever read\listened too!.,STAY HARD!!,First book was fantastic, but this one disappointed. There were some highlights, but too much repetition. He said it was not a self help book, at the beginning, but it was to many like many I‚Äôve read, too much guff and nor enough substance. Too much of repeating the same message, ‚ÄúYou can do it, push yourself to the limit and don‚Äôt listen to the naysayers‚Äù, in 100 different ways. This doesn‚Äôt do it for me, I need specifics etc. First book was amazing because of the life story recounted etc, this one seemed to be mainly recounting long races. Could have been improved with editing, I think."
The Running Grave,"International Mystery & Crime,Private Investigators","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Oh, my God!! I literally could not put this book down. I read for over 10 hours yesterday, and it‚Äôs now at least 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning and I just finished this book. This book had suspense from almost start to finish. If you‚Äôre wondering how I finished it so quickly, I started out at two times speed. Then I moved to 2.5 speed. Then I eventually moved to 2.7 speed, and finally I listen to the last 40 chapters are so at 3.3 X speed. That‚Äôs not the point though. What I‚Äôm trying to say is this book is one of the best crime novels I‚Äôve read in a while. At least, it‚Äôs the best modern crime novel I‚Äôve read in a while. I‚Äôm obviously very tired and I‚Äôm not thinking clearly. All I can say is read this one. It‚Äôs really good.,(Possible spoilers),I have loved all the previous books.  This one, no.,Hate the whole church cult premise.  Felt like it was an invention to keep Strike and Robin apart for a good part of the story.  But I don‚Äôt find it interesting unless they are really working together.  Content is so disturbing at times and the book is overlong as has been the case with the last few books.,Of course Strike and Robin‚Äôs personal story drags on with very little advancement.  Hate the cliffhanger ending b.s.,I just didn‚Äôt enjoy this one.  I always go back and listen to these books many times after I‚Äôve finished‚Äîthis one I won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ so I feel cheated in a way.,Narrator was perfection as always.,Bravura performance by the narrator, in spite of not pronouncing ""I Ching"" the way it is most usually pronounced these days.,,Now the book.,,This addition to the series demonstrates the author's unequaled storytelling genius.,,Although the plot(s) are contemporary, this book also incorporates some of the best of ""Golden Age"" British mystery tropes: London, English seaside towns, a hidden and sinister crazy community, eccentric characters, curries, fish & chips, glamor, squalor, and our beloved Robin as ever-ingenious, brave, enduring and unwaveringly determined Yorkshire bred heroine.,,It also has, of course, Strike, at his very best, struggling with his complicated life and emotions, while untangling seemingly impossible cases.,,This could very well be the author's best book so far.,,,,,What makes this series special and the reason I come back to it over and over is the interaction of Strike and Robin‚Ä¶..This book was lacking in that. There were many times I just skipped to the end of the chapter trying to get it done sooner.,Performance was great as always, story was ridiculous.,Increased length of book does not always equal a better book.,My all time favorites. I Savor the Strike series. They are Never long enough. Keep ‚Äòem coming, Galbraith!!,I can't think of ANY other book I've been so completely invested in as The Running Grave. JK Rowling delivers with a phenomenal and utterly riveting, edge-of-your-seat addition to the series. Be prepared to set your life completely aside (likely including quite a bit of foregone sleep) as you will be entirely engrossed for the next 34 hours of audiobook perfection.,So much better than The Ink Black Heart.  While the plot revolving around a cult figure is not new, Rowling‚Äôs imagination and impeccable pacing makes this an exciting addition to this series.,I was dismayed with the incorrect pronunciation of the I Ching.  I did appreciate the shorter epigraphs but found it cringeworthy and jarring hearing throughout 34 hours plus of  ‚ÄúI‚Äù  pronounced as ‚Äúeye‚Äù instead of ‚Äúee‚Äù, as a previous reviewer noted.  How can such a major narration error happen again in a Rowling audio production?,Absolutely love it. Great engaging, smart, exciting story. This particular book has a lot of action packed with details narrated so beautifully, you can see you're there! See the people, smell, taste and feel everything. loved it !,Loved it! Tremendous back story, fantastic set up, twist & turns - perfect cliff hanger! Best so far - edged out Troubled Blood by a smidge! Amazing series!,Cannot wait for the next installment!  Another masterfully written and narrated CS novel! could not put it down."
Dirty Thirty,"Women Sleuths,Crime Thrillers,Literature & Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Well she did it again! This is fantastic. The story was good, modern, engaging, and the ending‚Ä¶.oh man I don‚Äôt want to wait a year!,this book is perfect. I am team Ranger all the way!!! what a way to leave us!!! I'm already waiting for 31 without any spoilers. All I'm going to say is Ranger,She is rehashing previous story lines and even character names. The story was flat and not amusing until the end twist. That might breathe life into #31!,(I was the biggest fan for years but the last 5 books have deteriorated every year. Very sad. ),Please don‚Äôt stop giving us Stephanie!!! This series has been a go to for years!!!,And miss king is the best!!!!,The first books of the series were so funny, then they became dry and this one is in the middle. I read it because I‚Äôve read them all but honestly I would rather reread some of the earlier books,I've read this series for the better part of two years.  its formulaic, predictable, and hilarious. I love it. but at some point there has to be some growth or resolution or change. the last 5 books or so have all ended in a way that make you THINK this will finally happen and it still hasn't. this was more of the same old same old. a whole book to tease the possibility of change or growth or an answer to what Stefanie wants for herself and 0 payoff. I mean I'm reading the next one as soon as it comes out but I find each book to be a greater let down than the last.,This book didn‚Äôt let me down. It was funny as always. I love how Janet Evanovich always puts them is crazy situations. I love how she keeps giving the characters, more and more death. I can‚Äôt wait for book 31 to see if Stephanie picks Ranger or Joseph Morelli, I‚Äôm not sure if she will pick either of them. But it will be a blast finding out.  Lorelei King is great for the books. I‚Äôm hoping she voice all of the rest of the books.,Really enjoyed Dirty Thirty. Laugh out loud funny. Can‚Äôt wait for the next Stephanie Plum adventure.,I love these books!! I can‚Äôt wait for the next one to read who Stephanie chooses!!,As usual, an excellent narration but plot failed compared to others in the series.,30 lacked all the humor."
Words of Radiance,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"In the first book, ‚ÄúThe Way of Kings,‚Äù we were introduced to the world of Roshar. It is a world of magic and aliens where hurricane-like storms lay savage to the world every few days and all of its inhabitants must adapt their lives accordingly. It is a world at war between the human armies led by High prince Dalinar Kholin and the Parshendi, a humanoid species.  We were introduced to Jasnah, who is a renowned scholar and the niece of the High Prince Dalinar Kholin, her student Shallan, and Kaladin, a slave that by the end of Way of Kings is beginning to become the world‚Äôs first Knight‚Äôs Radiance in centuries.,If you haven‚Äôt read/listened to ‚ÄùThe Way of Kings,‚Äù I would strongly recommend that you do before going on to this second book, ‚ÄúWords of Radiance.‚Äù If you have read/listened to the first book I would recommend a review of TWOK before going on since it has been over four years and the second book starts off right where ‚ÄúThe Way of Kings,‚Äù left off.,At 48 hours and 15 minutes this is a long book, in fact Brandon Sanderson posted on his blog that he wrote the manuscript under the working title ‚Äúthe Book of Endless Pages.‚Äù He was referring to the endless learning set forth in his first book but it seemed appropriate given its length; but don‚Äôt let the length of this book deter you as I listened the hours seemed to fly past. This is an amazing book.,‚ÄúWord of Radiance‚Äù focuses on four characters: Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and Adolin. In TWOK Kaladin was the main character and is still very prevalent but this book reveals more about Shallan. Like ‚ÄúThe Way of Kings,‚Äù Sanderson interlaces the present with the past, developing the background on the main characters‚Äô while moving the plot forward.,This is only book two in a ten part series and even though I can‚Äôt wait for the next book I found the ending satisfactory.,I word about the narrators, I‚Äôve always been a big fan of  Michael Kramer and Kate Reading and I thought they gave another great performance.,,WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT OR WE WILL BREAK YOUR BRAIN,I have dreaded this review more then any review I have ever written. I am a huge fan of Sanderson. I have been telling people for the last two years that Brandon Sanderson is going to be the biggest thing in Fantasy. I loved, The Way of Kings and bought copies for my grown kids, for Christmas a couple of years ago. I was excited about this book.,A BELLY THAT STRETCHED TO NEXT WEEK,I could not get into this book  at all.  It may have started with the talking pattern. The pattern that Sanderson could not describe. Let me get this straight BS, you think this up on your own, you are a writer and you can not describe it to the reader. Why would you not come up with something you could describe. Then this pattern starts talking. It was just lame. I got tired of the Sea of Spheres. I got tired of the Dark Eyes whining about the Light Eyes. Someone said that it picked up in the last 25%, so I have to listen to 38 hours before it starts to get good?? Someone said he is now writing like Robert Jordan. I think trying to write like Jordan, has ruined him. I like Sanderson, bring him back. Actually I think he hired a ghost writer, cause this is not Sanderson.,Narrators: I have always been a fan of Michael Kramer. His deep rich voice makes chills run up my spine. The jury is still out for me on Kate Reading. Her voice is unique and I even recognized her in the commercial she did a few years ago because of that unique voice. I put her on 1.25 speed a few times and liked the result. I don't know maybe I need them to say Aes Sedai every other line?,If I wanted to be popular I would join the crowd and say I love this, but what few followers I have depend on the truth from me.  I got through ten hours and called it quits. If they offer this for free, that is 48 hours of your life you will never get back. At least my belly aching only lasts a couple of minutes.,,When I wrote my (too) short review of the first book in this series, The Way of Kings, I ended it with this sentence: ""This book is so good I will gladly listen to it again as a refresher when book two comes out!"",Well I am back to say that I followed through on my promise and it was worth every second. The Stormlight Archive is epic fantasy at it's best and Sanderson shows why he is at the top of my must read/listen list. Here I am fresh off of investing close to 94 hours of my life listening to books 1 and 2 of the Stormlight Archive and I am ready for more.,The world is rich and deep, the characters are complex, and the magic systems are true Sanderson - well defined, unique, and interesting. All of the main characters are back and the story just gets bigger and bigger. For most authors the end of this book would be a satisfying conclusion to any series but it is obvious that this one is just getting started. Sanderson set the bar so awfully high with the Mistborn series that I am truly impressed he was able to surpass himself with the Stormlight Archive.,Veteran narrators Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are back and once again breathe life into all of the great characters. It was a pleasure to listen to them both for 90+ hours and I can't wait for book three. These two know epic fantasy and combine with Sanderson to form a perfect highstorm of epic proportions.,If you like fantasy books then you will feel like a kid in a candy store here. It is time for you to run up to the counter and plunk down your credit(s) to enjoy this wonderful experience. You won't find more hours of entertainment for so little cost anywhere else. Of course you should start with The Way of Kings but be assured that 94 listening hours later you will find yourself back at the candy store counter standing on your tip toes and holding up another credit. Of course, I will be standing right next to you. :),Either of the readers would have done a wonderful job, but the use of two readers who clearly have not heard one another's take on the story is unfortunate. Different pronunciations and different accents between the readers makes portions of the performance unnecessarily messy.,I love Sanderson and will buy all of his books for his ability to give his characters life and their individual distinct voices, but I have to admit that Sanderson seems to have been distracted on this novel. Plots meandered and character development for his main hero, Kaladin, came to stop and even reverted back to his previous development from the first novel. Going to buy the next book and probably the rest in the series as I know Sanderson can pull it off and bring it together but still kind of a sophomore slump for this series. Hoping for better in Oathkeeper.,I will not get the third book if I got to listen the boring ass book 90% of the time man,Much like book one, this was not a very good performance. The story line was interesting but not what I would call good by any means. All in all I think you would be way better off to skip this series and find something a little better done.,This is what motivates my review: I have just spent over a month listening to over 80(!!) hours of The Stormlight Archive, and I find myself wishing for the next book.  Usually, I need a break between audiobooks in a series, not so here, despite the length.  So, as far as compelling listen-ability is concerned, this is a clear winner, well-read and fun as well!,You can stop reading here, if you want, since I feel completely justified in the five stars, but, still, there are a few issues, issues that mostly come from it being such an obviously EPIC epic. First, Sanderson is up to his usual trick of making an elaborate magic system with complex internal symmetries as a key driver of the plot. To an experienced Sanderson reader, some of the story is just waiting for the twists and turns to play out. How they do so is always interesting, and this is Sanderson's best yet, but, still, there are many echoes of Mistborn/Steelheart/Elantris, etc. The result makes elements of the plot a little obvious at times, though some occasional twists help keep things fresh.,Second, since this novel covers so much ground and is full of (occasionally exhausting) detail, Sanderson's squeamishness about issues like sex or desire stand out in a particularly glaring fashion. Fight scenes and horrific murders are portrayed in great (and well-written) detail, but the novel goes full young adult when discussing other forms of human interaction. I am not talking about a lack of anything graphic, but the complete modesty of the characters, especially the non-married characters, gets in the way of character-building, makes Kaladin and Shallan feel less well-rounded than they should be.,Still, Sanderson doesn't do grimdark (like Martin or Abercrombie), and it is nice to have a good old fashioned fantasy series, full of mysteries and destinies and action, to explore.  I will be waiting for the next!,Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors. His development of unique characters, worlds and systems-of-magic are perhaps for many of us without parallel in modern writing. It is in the actual writing that I am sometimes left frustrated. The story-telling is superb and keeps me coming back there's no question about it. I finished the book in less than a week and that after spending the previous week reading Book 1. Every available and non-sleeping moment was spent with the book. But there was always something missing... something that said this is still just not a literary work. Maybe it just seemed to me to be a bit too commercial. But Sanderson is young and I have no doubt that his writing will mature even more and I will come to a completely different conclusion about his place in history and the body of works considered great literature.,The production and narration by two premier narrators was excellent.,Don't buy this. You may have to because the The Way of Kings was such a great book.,First thing that'll hit you:,Kate Readings is narrating over half of this book.,So our lovely heroes and villains all become 12 year old children where you can't tell if its a boy or a girl or whether they mean to kill somebody or not.,Second thing you will notice:,This book is total trash compared to the first.,So please do purchase the book and then get a refund for it."
Snowed In,"Holidays,Romantic Comedy",Literature & Fiction,"I loved loved loved this book so much! The narrators were brilliant and the story itself has made its way into my heart and will stay there forever as one of my all time favorite holiday books/ romance novels ever! Please do yourself a favor and read this one!,This was such a cute story, and highly entertaining! A quick read to get into the holiday spirit. Definitely think will be one of my favorite holiday reads. I was laughing the whole way through! Fake dating, forced proximity, Irish family, runaway bride ‚Äî what more could you ask for!,Catherine Walsh has done it yet again! Snowed In was lovely, gripping, hard to put down, delightful and romantic. I was drawn into this wonderful book from the very first page. I always look forward to reading her books. Walsh never disappoints, she only dazzles!,,Megan was a runaway bride and has not been back home since she left Isaac at the altar several years ago. But this year she is going home. Christian is heading home as well this Christmas. He dreads the looks his family gives him when he shows up alone. He saw Megan flee on the day she left Isaac at the altar. When Megan literally bumps into Christian in a pub, they begin talking about their current lives, their families, and the upcoming holiday. The plan to be each other's fake dates during the holiday.,,Both main characters were likeable, witty, endearing and I rooted for both. Snowed In was an addictive fake dating/relationship holiday book. With romance, it is all about the journey for me and I loved the journey Walsh took her characters on. I love how nothing felt rushed or drawn out. Plus, this book had not only some funny moments but heart and soul. I loved how both characters had to not only deal with their individual family but with the others family members as well. This made for some funny and dramatic scenes. Plus, the setting! I love books that take place in wintery snowy places. The chill in the air gets me every time.,,I had the pleasure of having both the book and audiobook for Snowed In. This made for a completely delightful reading experience! The narrators were fantastic and did a wonderful job of bringing this book to life. I enjoyed the drama, the humor, the witty banter, and the way the plot unfolded.,,Gripping, delightful, well written, well thought out and hard to put down! I can‚Äôt wait to read what Catherine Walsh writes next!,Love is in the air!  Loved listening to this audiobook.  I was hooked in the first chapter.,,Set in Ireland, Megan and Christian decide to return home as fake dates for Christmas. As they fake their relationship for their families, they start to fall in love.  Trapped in a cabin in the mountains after a snow storm, their attraction flourishes.,,This story was perfect to kick off the holiday season with some romance.  The author developed the  relationship in each chapter of the book which peaked when they are snowed in together. Humor, banter, family dynamics and falling in love.  I loved the narrators, Roisin Rankin, Colm Gleeson.  Their accents drew me in and made me feel like we were in Ireland.,,I would recommend this sweet book.,,Thank you to the @Netgalley and @bookouture audio who provided the ARC.  Put it on your TBR.,,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it more than the first one, Holiday Romance, but I did! So sweet, and I love the way they just share their thoughts. I laughed out loud and loved knowing all about Molly and Andrew‚Äôs relationship from the first book as they continue that relationship in this book too.,Megan is awesome. I love her confidence. Christian and Megan together is the best. Just the sweetest book anytime of year, especially during the holidays. Thank you Catherine Walsh!,Loved this book as much as Holiday Romance which says a lot. Catherine Walsh has delivered with another holiday winner!,Lovely follow up to Holiday Romance, bringing irresistible Irish characters together in family conflicts and love.,This story is set around Christmas with traditions and snow.  I would not consider it really a rom-com as I did not find it funny, it was a bit serious.  Both MC's were dealing with acceptance of who they are after events in their life's left them a bit unsure about going home.  Of course they found understanding and solace in each other plus interactions with the side characters to heal-this was the focus of the story. Other side characters were important to continue the Christmas storyline from the last book.  Story was cute with a bit of steam and the narrators did a good job.,Snowed in is cute holiday romance. I liked Christian and Megan‚Äôs romance. It was sweet romance that had them together in a fake dating situation that turned into love. The world is rich and the side characters are gorgeously written as well. The drama and the humor kept the story interesting and it was well paced.,Loved every second! Screaming, crying, and kicking my feet through the whole thing! I loved Holiday Romance last year and I was so excited to read this one this year! It was perfect!,if you like rom-coms that actually make you laugh, with characters you really care about, this is one big hug of a book. Catherine Walsh writes flirting as well as Emily Henry does, and the narration is perfect too.,Beautiful Christmas read! So glad I found it. I could listen to the narrators voices all day .,Such a lovely story , highly recommend xx,I surprisingly and thoroughly enjoyed this, it was a difficult to get pulled into the story for the first two chapters. However, the story drastically is fast paced after and I loved every minute of it.,I do wish there was more exploration of their romance, the romance brewing was more towards the latter part of the book and left little space for the actual romance to take place.,I LOVED Christian and Megan. Aiden and Andrew were my favourite though, I loved the versatile characters presented to us in the book. The depth and exploration of meaningful issues were consistently played throughout and I love how they didn‚Äôt go through a break up just to realise they love each other. That trope can be tiring reading again and again.,Loved the depth of the romance between the two, the dual narrators and how their personalities each shone through so strongly, and the wit throughout!"

Holly,"Horror,Psychological,Suspense",Literature & Fiction,",,Holly is the latest mesmerizing audiobook from Stephen King. It is a terrific psychological thriller with a touch of mystery thrown in for good measure.,Mr. King delivers another masterful story featuring Holly Gibney, one of his most compelling and ingeniously resourceful characters.,Holly returns in this thrilling novel to unravel the gruesome truth behind multiple disappearances in a midwestern town. She is a private investigator who has a knack for finding clues and solving puzzles, but also struggles with her own fears and insecurities. She is determined to uncover the dark secrets that lurk behind the seemingly peaceful facade of the town and not even the corona pandemic will be able to stop her from achieving this objective.,The writing is brilliant, the characters feel alive, and the plot is full of mystery and suspense.,The narration by renowned American actor Justine Lupe is absolutely flawless! She manages to perfectly channel Holly just like she did in the Mr. Mercedes series, where Holly first appeared as a supporting character. You may also know Justine from her appearance in TV shows such as Succession and many others.,Her performance is on point, emotional, energetic and entertaining. She brings Holly to life with ease, capturing her personality, quirks, and emotions.,Every time a new Stephen King audiobook is released, I drop everything and immerse myself into these mesmerizing tales. Holly is a must-listen for any fan of Stephen King or anyone who loves a good thriller.,With Holly Mr. King rewards, delights and entertains his constant readers endlessly.,I am a blind audiobook reviewer, so if you found this review interesting I hope you will consider leaving a helpful vote below. Most audiobooks I receive for free for review purposes. Thank you! Take care, stay safe, and don't forget, always listen with your heart.,Guarantee 90% of reviews will be complaining about Leftist conspiracies. üòÇ I am still in the beginning of the book but I couldn‚Äôt wait to run to the ‚Äúcomment section‚Äù. I think the book is perfect for its time, when Covid and Trump completely saturated and obliterated everyday life. You think it‚Äôs too much or overstated? Well, that is exactly how living through those years was. It was every single day, all day, every day. How quickly we forget. So, if you‚Äôre writing a book that is set in that time period, this is spot on. It was THAT annoying and unending. Anyhoo, back to the story, which seems to be pretty engaging- I‚Äôve been waiting for this pre-order for months!!,Just use covid, Trump or masks. 4 chapters in. Not sure I'll finish. I have listened to every other King novel up to this point. I may be done with him as an author unless he can get his head on straight and remember what we pay him for. I guess that us low peasants can't even get our entertainment without our betters preaching to us on how to live our lives. I give the first 4 chapters 1 star, not sure why Audible keeps changing my score to 5 stars.,I never review books, so this is the last thing I wanted to do. I listen to King because he‚Äôs so great at talking you out of the real world but this book has been his feelings about Covid, police and the past president in a character I used to love. I get putting a smidge of his political leanings sometimes but this was a tear down of all of the people who didn‚Äôt get vaccinated or voted for Trump. The disappointment with the narrator was annoying, when the same one can‚Äôt be used for a main character it lags. I was willing to go with it but the guilt pushing for non vaccinated people I can‚Äôt. Just write a story not an option piece on politics. If that‚Äôs what you want to do then put it in the description so those of us that don‚Äôt want to blow our money on it!,Stephen king is done stop wasting money on his left wing preaching about his opinions I listen to audible for escape from life if I want left wing covid fear mongering I‚Äôll turn on national news only reason I gave one star is because audible makes you leave at least one star,This is your storyline. King hates Trump. King hates anti-vaxxers.  Oh yeah, and then there is Holly. Return to sender.,I love this book. Smart, fun, exciting, interesting, scary. I like that Stephen King felt brave enough to share his political opinions knowing that he would probably lose a few fans.,Not just preachy but uninspired and exhausting. I listened to the end and the whole time felt like the author was trying to cram in as many references as possible to COVID and politics just to seem current and relevant. A huge disappointment, as I have been really looking forward to the new Holly release. Also miss Will Patton's masterful narration very much.,First, no disrespect to Justine Lupe but she's no will Patton. And holly books have ALWAYS been Will Patton. Very preachy book from word one. We get it King, you don't like Trump! We get it, you're 100% pro vaccine for Covid. I definitely miss his older books and even most of his middle books. The new ones are tiresome from the gate. I will continue on for I am that fabled constant reader, but I don't have to like it. Please reissue in the future with narrator Will Patton. I will purchase and try listening again. Thank you for your time. SK has forgotten the face of his father.,I wonder if he wrote this? Holly comes out of a story line that is one of King's best & most creative. That same person did not write this one. I love political commentary, but that is what non-fiction is for and it ruined this story. I'd love to see it rewritten without it... :("
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Book 7","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"I have to admit I always wondered what the big deal was about this series; although I saw some of the movies years ago and enjoyed them, I never read the books. When they became available on Kindle/Audible however I ordered the first book for my 8 y.o. daughter thinking she‚Äôd like to listen to it. Then I thought I‚Äôd try it out and see if I liked it myself; I was a little hesitant having already seen the movie and worried that listening to the book might be repetitive. But, I learned quickly that I was SO WRONG. There is SO much more detail, storyline, insight and humor, amongst many other things, woven into the pages that of course you don‚Äôt see on a DVD. I ended up listening to all 7 of the audiobooks in just under 2 months, and I finished Deathly Hallows about 4 days ago and I feel SO EMPTY! Lol! There is nothing else that will measure up/compare to this series or its writer. I am going to start on JK Rowling‚Äôs ‚Äòadult‚Äô books next I think, but I have half a mind to re-listen to my favorite Harry Potter books first, even this soon after finishing them, which I‚Äôve NEVER done. I love the characters, the effortless way the story builds throughout all 7 books and I love the fact that something that might have happened in book 2 or 3 might be referenced in later books. I also loved the ‚Äúreal‚Äù way that certain things that weren‚Äôt obvious in the beginning of the series (i.e. whom Harry ends up with) develop in a way that feels completely natural and of course like that was meant to happen all along. Nothing in any of the HP books feels forced or conveniently created to serve a plotline that otherwise might be struggling. Despite its theme of witchcraft and wizardry Harry Potter seems very human and even relatable at times, thanks to the genius woman who created him, especially when it comes to his relationship with his closest friends. I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to leave them behind.,Oh and yes, I agree with many other reviewers that Jim Dale was the one and only narrator who could've brought this story to life in the amazing way that he did. So many characters, so many distinct voices, and he nailed them all in a way that I found myself comparing HIS version to the movie versions and, in many cases, finding I preferred Jim's.,I will miss Harry, Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Snape, all the characters who made these books what they were, but I might have to revisit them soon because I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to handle this impending post-HP depression hahaha. Wish me luck...,,Though I snapped up and immediately listened to the whole series, this is the only review I'm doing of Harry Potter as it's where Rowling and Dale's true genius shines forth. ""The Deathly Hallows"" ties everything, and I mean everything together in such a brilliant way. From the incredible awe and enchantment of the very first book, through all of them, and here to the masterful and mature finish, skill flourishes like a magic quill on a scroll of parchment.,Let's see. How about the polyjuice potion that was so delightful in ""The Chamber of Secrets"" that becomes commonplace then part of a daring plan to rob Gringott's in ""The Deathly Hallows""? House elves introduced early who become keys to solving the mysterious ""R.B"" of a locket/Horcrux? Dementors that crippled Harry early on who become used a watchdogs? And let's start with dragons: from the birth of Norbert in the first book, to being a part of a challenge in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, to becoming part of an ingenious escape from the bowels of the earth.,See how it all works? Why it's genius? Rowling, in each book, manages to plant early clues, foreshadow all that will be important, to great effect. But that she managed, no, excelled in shading things from each book to this grand finale is mind-blowing.,And through it all, each character grew and matured. She even had the guts to have Harry turn into a snarling teenager in ""The Order of the Phoenix"" and brought him through that to become the fairly wise young man he winds up as.,""The Deathly Hallows"" has it all. Plus, it has Jim Dale narrating perfectly. How he managed to make each character distinct throughout, to breathe so much life into each written word is beyond me, but boy do I appreciate it. He was a real treat to listen to with perfect pacing, even tho' I wound up listening at 1.25 speed because I just can't handle delayed gratification: I wanted to hear Harry's story NOW (even though I've read each book, like, a million times!).,Treat yourself to the series, yes, but don't, DO NOT miss out on this last piece of one of the tastiest most perfectly seasoned pies around. Rowling and Dale are awe-inspiring, and I can't wait to listen, from book one on up, to this series again and again...,And again...,What an amazing series!,Jim Dale, best narrator on the planet. Different voices for each character, brilliant. So easy to visualize each one's personality.,i have listened to this series upwards of 5+ times and Jim Dale's commentary is just amazing time and time again. i laugh out loud, i tear up, and still get chills during the battles. i dont think i will ever tire of harry potter,This whole series never gets old to me. I always have it on while I'm running around the house.  The narrator gives a truly magical performance. He is truly amazing!,‚ÄúDo not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.‚Äù,,Story:  The action, suspense, danger, adventure and magic you find in this book is extraordinary.  J.K. Rowling did a wonderful job of pulling a number of pieces together to wrap up the story.  The book explains so much more than could be squeezed into the movie and it really illuminates a number of things that did not make sense to me just from the movie.  Classic example of how the book is significantly better.  I feel most people will have similar feelings, but the story and connection between Harry, Dumbledore and Snape really makes this book amazing.  Also, the detail on the Deathly Hallows and the relationship to Harry was awesome.,,Narration: I caved and gave this 5 stars.  I still feel that some of the female voices are lacking and, for me, are less than stellar.  Luna and Ginny come to mind.  That said, overall, the narration is great and very engaging.  Jim Dale was able to bring the characters to life and really pulled me into the story.,,Overall:  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a fantastic end to the series.  I knew that this would be different from the movie (again, having never read/listened to all of the books until now), but I had no clue how in the dark I was from just seeing the movies.  So much was explained so well.  My mind was also blown when I learned about the more than probable relationship between Harry and the Peverell family.  Seriously, this series is amazing!  If you have not already done so, listen to this series!,,Jim Dale is the most talented narrator and makes the books come to life even more so than the movies.,Would you listen to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Book 7 again? Why?,Absolutely, In fact I've already listened to it at least three times. This is one of the best written endings to a series ever.,What does Jim Dale bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,Love the narration. He does so many voices that at times I forget it's just one person!,Any additional comments?,So excited these books are finally available on Audible!,J  M Rolling brings it all together in this crescendo of a novel that brilliantly ties up every loose end and story arch from her previous novels. The battles,  from heroic frenzied war scenes to inward moral dilemmas bring us insights anew into our most beloved fictional friends and hated literary enemies.  Impressive,  supremely satisfying , and absolutely her best work yet.,Once it got rolling, you simply couldn't stop listening. Started off full of doubt and worry, but the story arc was perfect in the end!,This is one of the best books of all time. J.k. Rowling has don a brilliant job."

The Shadow Rising,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Now totally addicted to the pattern that Jordan has woven, I have to admit this last installment was by far my favorite. YES, critics of Jordan are right in that he can describe every detail in the most mundane scenes...and YES, his characters are a bit one dimensional in their personas...BUT with a story this complex I have to admit I appreciate characters that I know won't change on me from chapter to chapter or book to book. What I think most critics miss is that this book is about the storyline and the pattern, not just about the characters that play within it.,,This past week I learned that Jordon has died and that he didn't finish his last book in the series (and rumor has it the last installment is a mammoth!). I am committed to finishing this out and seeing Rand through as the Dragon reborn, finding out what Lord Perin Golden Eyes does, and discover what's up with Matt and his flair for luck and history. 4 books down, 8 more to go!,The lack of real progress in this story is driving me crazy. I'm going to have to give it up cause I just can't sit through another 41 hours of boring lack of progress.,I am struggling with continuing this series.  The overall concept is intriguing but the writing is difficult sometimes.  Things happen to characters that after four books we still have no explanation for,  the girls are airheads at the best of times,  oh Rand this and oh Rand that and all of the sudden he and Egwayne have no feelings for each other with no lead up,  Elaine writes two letters that we have no insight into,  Minh is supposed to be street savvy yet she sounds like an idiot when it comes to the opposite sex and someone please shoot me when Nineavh speaks.  She's mean and grouchy and how are we supposed to like her or how do the others like her?   Anyways I'm still listening because it is entertaining but im hoping Mr.  Jordan connects the dots and smartens up the characters in the rest of the books.,I stopped reading the series after this book. The tragedy of this series is that the world, the back-history, and magic system are exquisitely developed, but the plot is repetetive and the characters are hollow. The pattern of the plot (no spoiler) is a less-than-brilliant move by (insert character), which leads to an emergency, which is resolved at the last second in a maddeningly convenient manner (usually either an unlooked-for rescue or a new manifestation of magic). The characters are fantasy stereotypes. However, the books are very suspenseful, and these are common issues in all but the best fantasy. All might be forgiven except for the sheer unnecessary length of the series. There are at least two major plot lines that a good editor would have axed altogether to bring focus to a badly meandering story arc and cut the size down a bit.  I would recommend this series only to die-hard fantasy aficionados who will appreciate what was done well and forgive what was done poorly.,,I have been lukewarm at best about most of the series so far, as Jordan's penchant for exhaustive repetition is nothing short of maddening, but in this book he manages to drop it (along with the omnipresent adolescent angst that manages to overshadow every significant event by burying it under a mountain of triviality) long enough to achieve a few moments with some genuine emotional resonance. To avoid posting any spoilers, I will refrain from specifics, but the most poignant are the moments of history that Rand views, and they succeed where so many other efforts by Jordan fail because he--probably unintentionally--drops his usual writing devices and gets out of the way to simply narrate the events for us. The contrast between this part and most of the rest of the series is really amazing, and shows just how strongly we can feel the emotions of the moment without having to have it spelled out repeatedly for us both before and afterward. It's unfortunate that Jordan seems to trust the intelligence of his readers so little.,,So kudos to the author for some really great moments in this book (there are one or two more, but I cannot describe them without giving things away). I wish there were more like them throughout the rest of the series.,I believe this is one of the best in the series.  I can't wait for the Fires of Heaven to come out.  I really pray it is the unabridged version!,I truly love the wheel of Time series universe created by Robert Jordan. For years I have both read listen to these books the only drawback is the petty war of the sexes immature nearly constant quarreling between the primary characters.,Its quite incongruous when comparing the lifetimes of literally earth shattering import these beings represent to the high school level judgmental pithiness and childish banter they display towards each other.,Rand and Perrin seem to be the only ones evolving into capable characters matching their reality.,Already deep into Book 4 and seriously these characters should have grown out of this by now. if it doesn‚Äôt stop soon I don‚Äôt think I can continue listening. Its beyond annoying and destroys the otherworldly fantasy element i so enjoy,Through out the Wheel of Time different threads of each part continue to get more and more intriguing. The changes/challenges each character undergoe never fail to leave you wanting more.,Storylines pick up quite a bit in book four. The three main protagonists begin embracing their respective roles as Taurvanianamias (only Jordan knows how to spell that word). There's more action as well.,Note: I want to give this series one star when the story focuses on the women, Nineve in particular. I've never hated a character as much as Nineve; she's utterly obnoxious dimwit with less than zero common sense ‚Äî a stupid, stupid girl.,Both narrators are truly outstanding, especially Michael Kramer. Bravo indeed.,This series has been fantastic, and this book is the best so far. Can't wait to get the next one...,The narrators do not have the depth or range required to do the variety of accents required. Particularly the female narrator. Her attempts to do Seanchan slur were terrible. A British narrator could have managed the variety of accents better. She can barely get beyond an American accent. She also couldn't effectively differentiate between young and old. Which is annoying as I'm engrossed in the story so have to carry on listening.,only thing that frustrates me in this audiobook is the narrators not pronouncing names and places the same, it makes me unsure how it should actually be said.,Often the audio paused more than as expected between    sentences where we should here the continuation of the story. this seems to be due to the cut and edition of difference recordings. I noticed this for the first time in book 3, but in this one this issue seems more frequent and it decreases the performance quality m,The narration is acceptable but not amazing. I recommend the Rosamund Pike versions as they come out. I was blown away by her skill and pleasantly surprised by just how good an audiobook can be. Pike has a suiting voice for every character and you know exactly who is talking, or at least where they are from if they are a yet unknown character. It really helps emerge you into the their world.,liked book one, tolerated book 2, enjoyed book 3 (especially the crescendo at the end) and loved book 4. this book will keep you hooked from beginning to end with twists and turns you don't expect, characters growing and changing, plots thickening. Bloody brilliant!,My favourite book.Perrin's parts are the best. A great epic. Nothing like the rubbish TV series.,Really struggling with the narration. I love the series, I loved Rosamund Pike's narration of earlier books. The robotic nature of the narrators means it's frustrating to listen to.I fought on but abandoned by chapter 5. Speeding up the narration didn't  help either. Disappointed.,My life has changed so much over the year I have read this series not so much the things that are in my life but my outlook on it. With a heavy heart I finish the last book and can confidently say with a tear in my eye this is the best book series I have read in my thousands of hours of reading and listening to them this is the first and likely the last book series that has made me cry at the end and if you are apprehensive about reading a 14 book series I can tell you now that you will not regret it at the end a phenomenal story all the way through with a pair of incredible readers makes these books my favourite of all time.,Just chapter 8 with Rand and Elyane it was so awkward all I heard was I‚Äôm fond of you for like minute it was so funny and awkward generally a good scene in showing the emotions of the characters.,I've read this series before , enjoying the retelling because off eye condition, excellent,Love this series!,I recommend listening at 1.2 or 1.3 speed,very eager to listen to the next one,Really enjoyed this. It is complex so you have to pay attention. I read the books and have found things I missed. The narration is excellent. starting the next book today!,I really like this particular book of the wheel of time saga because things really get moving  this was also read fantastically,The story continues to grow. captivating and amazing. You will not regret this book series,The narration seems so flat after listening to the reading by Rosamund Pike, her characters sound like I imagined they did when I read The eye of the World as a kid. After hearing Rhuarc say, ‚ÄúSleep well and safely‚Äù I pretty much gave up. Will wait for future Rosamund Pike readings. Fingers crossed.,This has got to be my favourite of the books, although it only get better from here.,love it the characters growth is so good and the way the story continues to drew me in ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,This series is not perfect. But damn it just keeps getting better with every book. Getting to know characters better, watching them grow. The interwoven elements are amazing. I always like RJ's Conan books but, as fun as they were, this is so much better. I dont have the words to really express how amazing these books are. I do prefer Rosamund Pyke's narration. She does an incredible job. I liked the TV Show before I read the books. Now I would rather the TV show had never been made. It does not even deserve to hide in the shadows of the books.,I currently have a newborn baby and listening to this series while I take care of him has been really great.,Im not a huge fantasy buff but I really enjoy Robert Jordan‚Äôs world building.,The Wheel of Time series keeps going from strength to strength with it's story and the narration is fantastic and engaging."
Heir of Fire,"Epic,Paranormal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I think we can all agree, the first book was Meh, the second book got better. But the third, this one, made it all worth it‚Ä¶ I cannot wait to start the next one,I cried several times during this book.,Goosebumps and goodness it is now my favorite book. I absolutely love it. I have so many favorite quotes and chapters now. This book made me like it more than her other series, and I‚Äôm glad I read it after because the other series don‚Äôt even come close to this one. üíö,üìöBOOK REVIEWüìö,238/250,Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è/5,Throne of Glass series #3. My gosh! This book was so great! We see Celaena become Celaena Sardothien. We see the journey she took beginning 10 years ago and leading to her becoming the queen she is. Then enters Rowan Whitethorn. Rowan is a fae prince who is broody, stubborn, and not at all nice to start off, but you can just tell his character is going to be something great. Dorian and Chaol are still very much present in this story line but we also meet Aedion Ashryner (warrior and Celaena's cousin), Manon Blackbeak (the heir to the Blackbeak coven of Ironteeth witches) and her Thirteen.,The character development in this book is top notch. There are so many main players and secondary characters and I felt like I knew them all intimately. The world building is phenomenal (as always) and the action is ramping up. And Sarah's writing just keeps getting better. Assassin's Blade is next and I can't wait!,Y‚Äôall, the character development is fabulous. This series just builds and builds and I‚Äôm so impressed with SJM‚Äôs ability to create such unique characters and relationships. This is a book and series I‚Äôll keep coming back to.,I'm addicted to Sarah J Maas. Her world building and characters, they feel real, like you know them.,I'm pretty sure these books or for teenagers or young adult.  However I am still a fan.  I wish that the female main characters were a few years older.  it just comes across creepy to me.  There are these 500 year old faeries who look like they are 20 that are dating 18 year old just rubs me wrong.  Not wrong to stop reading it though.  Because they are still grown.  Out of the Throne of Glass series this one has hit the mark.  my favorite so far.,The narration is so good I‚Äôve reread this book simply because the performance and story is entrancing. I was so sad to finish this series. I wish I could go back and read it for the first time again.,Here in the story, things begin to pick up. I was so excited for what was to come.,Can‚Äôt wait to get through the next book. Going to tandem read the Empire of Storms and Tower of Dawn since both books are happening at the same time but different places. U can fine the chapter list on tic tok.,My favorite book so far of the series. Captivating, emotional, relatable, exciting, all the things."
Project Hail Mary,"Adventure,Hard Science Fiction,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I enjoyed both The Martian and Artemis so I pre-ordered this one and started it immediately. It did not disappoint. Andy Weir is one of my favorite authors and Ray Porter is one of my favorite narrators so this combination is a win-win. The narration is superb and the writing is great. I recommend this book. Don't over think it. This is worth the price of admission.,Disclaimer: My enjoyment of the narrator is based on my listening speed. I only leave 5 stars for books I've listened to or will listen to multiple times.,Andy Weir is at his absolute best when he‚Äôs spouting off insane scientific technobabble with a main character that feels simply like a smarter version of the rest of us. Maybe not even smarter, maybe simply more knowledgeable. Space and the science related to it are his happy place and we‚Äôre all the better for it. Ray Porter has so much ability to not only narrate a story but make us feel as if we‚Äôre the ones experiencing it. If you haven‚Äôt yet had the pleasure of listening to the entire Bobiverse line of audiobooks then finish this and immediately go to them. Perfect narrator for a perfect setting. I haven‚Äôt quite finished the book yet, so no spoilers or definitive reviews of the story but I absolutely love where it‚Äôs going and can‚Äôt wait to hear the rest. Keep the hits coming Mr. Weir.,Ah, what a joy this book was!,The story is as fantastic and entertaining as any of Weir's books, but what really knocks it off the park is Ray Porter's narration. He‚Äôs just the perfect (and only, in my opinion!) narrator choice for this book.,On the other hand, similarities with The Martian include a lone man in space science-ing the sh!t out of life-threatening circumstances. Weir‚Äôs trademark blend of science and humor occasionally had me hearing astronaut Mark Watney instead of MC Ryland Grace, even with the different, phenomenal narrator that is Ray Porter. But, don‚Äôt pass on this book thinking it‚Äôs just a Martian variation. This story is spectacularly fresh, full-credit worthy, and dare I say better than The Martian! This is Bill Nye the Science Guy as the hero in Armageddon, with (mostly) real  science delivered in an entertaining manner only possible from Andy Weir. Oh, and we may not get disco, but we do get a little Beatles, and the greatness of Rocky. That‚Äôs all you get- anything more would spoil this outstanding story.,I have listened to this book hundreds of times and it never gets old.  Andy is becoming one of my favorite authors. his creativity in the writing is awesome. I love how the MC in this one is almost the exact opposite of Mark Watney in his last book ""The Martian"".,I also love how he writes about the science. It never feels like the explanations are forced and they are always explained in a way that anyone can follow along and not get lost.,The Icing on the cake for this book had to be Ray Porter. His performance was absolutely perfectly done. So well in fact that if this ever becomes a series on tv or a movie, I'd want the actor playing Grace to do it exactly how Ray did.,Best money I ever spent on a book. cant wait till the next one!,,Awesome story telling.  Great build up of the characters and universe.  Can't compare to The Martian as that was novel/unique, but this absolutely crushes Artemis.  Reminds me of a cross between Old Man's War and the Three Body Problem (but slightly less cerebral than the latter).,Let me start off by saying that I strongly enjoyed The Martian and Artemis (please, please don't let the negative comments of others dissuade you from reading Artemis). Until yesterday, American Gods was my unrivaled favorite; as of finishing Project Hail Mary, it is now tied for my very favorite. I will not provide spoilers, but if you enjoy good science fiction (Scalzi, Taylor, Adams) and understand that what makes good science fiction is good science, get Project Hail Mary.,As for Ray Porter, I fell in love with his narration of We Are Legion (We Are Bob) and its sequels. His enthusiastic, geeky, humorous, witty, and sarcastic tones are an absolute delight to my ears. No other narrator could have done as well or better.,I don't regret preordering both the audiobook and a signed copy of Project Hail Mary in the slightest. To the contrary, I am elated and am looking forward to listening to this audiobook many, many times.,While the Martian is quite scientifically correct, this story is more about fantasy than science. And as a fantasy sci-fi, it does not really stand out as the story is not really novel nor innovative.,,If you haven't read a lot of sci-fi, this book could be a good pick. If you have, the story could be a bit boring,In this new title Andy Weir is coming back home to what made the martian such a breakout hit. One smart guy, in an impossible, incredibly hostile situation that has to ""science"" it out. And while it maintains that same DNA there's enough different here in context and objective that the problems our protagonist deals with remain novel and engaging.,,There's not much I can say negative about it. The only thing maybe is that this book is structured in present day/flashback style and while the present day story is always highly engaging and interesting the flashbacks can drag a bit to the point where anytime the story cuts to the past you get a little upset.,,Other than that, just a really fantastic and fun story.,,I am not trying to make this a commentary on the state of division in society, but reading reviews for this book makes me drift to thinking about how very different people are, which is just perplexing to me. This book is great, the main reason I listen to SF is to escape the craziness we live. It is called SF for a reason. If I don't like a book I just simply won't continue listening, but I truly hope someone else may find it entertaining. Maybe I'm just not a negative person, which is an absurd description of me according to my wife. I enjoyed this book more than The Martian, a book that blew my mind the first time I listened to it. I wish audible could allow every reviewer to have a quick link of their top 10 or even 3 favorite books. It would really help in deciding whether or not I trust an opinion. If you are looking for an escape, this book is perfect in my humble opinion.,Every review of this book will have a mention of The Martian in it so let‚Äôs get the name out of the way now! The Martian was my first audio book and it was incredibly performed with an amazing, involving story. You couldn‚Äôt help but be swept away and engaged with it. The story was science faction at its best with twists and turns to keep you on your toes.,Project Hail Mary: Ctrl c, ctrl v!,It‚Äôs not a copy but it does follow a similar path. A huge problem needs to be solved. You solve one problem and move to the next, if you solve enough problems you get to go home. The Martian interspaced this with what was going on in the Hermes and Earth, this time it‚Äôs Graces memory returning. Whilst it can be a little convenient with his memory returning in chronological order there is an explanation for this and I was willing to accept it.,The reader, Ray Porter, read another series of books called the Bobiverse series and I have to admit this was very similar but in a good way. Dennis E Taylor‚Äôs writing style is very similar to Andy‚Äôs with hard science interspersed with humour and an engaging story. I can recommend both.,In conclusion this was an excellent story, well researched with good character development. The special audio effects (no spoilers) add a depth that I have not heard before and do nothing but enhance the experience, once you get used to them. This will be going in my top ten favourites and I cannot recommend it highly enough, well done Andy!,I must admit it felt a bit dull at the beginning, or maybe I wasn't ready for it. We can see a definite evolution in Andy's story telling, in a good way. I was expecting another Martian and got something more along the lines of what we would expect from Heinlein, but with the usual great science description we learn to love. Great story twists. Ray Porter was also the perfect voice (same voice in The Bobverse) for this book. I'm sure I will listen to this book several more times.,The narrator is good good good and the story is bad bad bad.,,The story starts fairly interesting and then descends into something boring at best and annoying at worst. The books reads like it's written by someone with a lot of hobbies who enjoys his hobbies intensely and spends his time imaging how these hobbies would come in handy in space survival adventures. I cannot comment on the physics side of this attemp at hard science sci-fi as I'm not a physicist, but I am a bioinformatician, and the lack of realism and knowledge regarding biology really would have taken me out of the story if I wasn't already utterly bored by the narrator's voice. The prose is shockingly poor. If you want to spend 17h listening to someone who sounds like their every sentence ends with an exclamation mark and who says things like 'yeah, relativity physics is super weird' and 'science is awesome' then this is a book for you. There will be no character development and no reason to feel invested in the character. You don't care if he dies a horrible death or not and you don't even care if the whole of Earth will perish.,Absolutely brilliant. I‚Äôm very impressed all round. Just couldn‚Äôt stop listening, and also couldn‚Äôt wipe the smile off my face:),I love all Andy weir books and I especially love ray porters performances ! This was an incredible experience to listen to I can‚Äôt recommend it enough,I was glad to pick up another Andy Weir offering, and a lot of what made The Martian so much fun is here again.,That said, I felt that a lot of the humour felt very formulaic and forced. That is not to say that you should give it a miss. If you enjoyed The Martian, you will liklely enjoy this as well.,Narration is good, story is OK (if a little less believable than The Martian) but doesnt quite have that special  something that made The Martian a book that I return to again and again.,One of the previous reviews said it was not what was expected in a good way- couldnt agree more,,This is one of my new favourite books especially with Ray Porter as lucky one reading it out.,,If you like Dennis E Taylors BOBIVERSE you will love this,,the writing is amusing and self critical. The main character is an everyman who ends up trying to save the world,,Cant praise the book enough. I enjoyed this one more than The Martian,Fan of weir,,Fan of Porter...,Another great novel from Andy Weir... the narration from Ray Porter will help you to suspend your belief to far flung solar systems... I had to check a couple of times to make sure I wasn‚Äôt listening to other books with similar themes also narrated by Porter, though this is great and in the same vein!,Enjoy!,excellent. finished in 2 days. very technical, good pacing, and can't wait for more like this. great narrator.,,I wasn't sure what to expect and that's not always a bad thing, and as such I'm not even going to mention the story here other than to say it is a return to story style of The Martian. It's clear it took more production to make this audiobook than normal and Ray Porter is very safe hands, in fact, as good as he usually is anyway, he is phenomenal here.,Don't go into this book with expectations based on the Martian, yes there is similarities but it has qualities the Martian doesn't. Spot on character development for the main character. Still the Andy Weir classic of every small side character has to be rememberable with weird traits and personality flaws but they detract from the story way less. Great read highly recommended,Could not stick with it. Wildly over acted reading, biasing interpretation of book towards goofy.,There is a ridiculous amount of science and maths in this book, none of which I know, but it doesn‚Äôt matter.  The story was interesting, funny and unpredictable (except when he says ‚Äúwhat could go wrong?‚Äù).  I absolutely loved it and have already recommended it to everyone around me.,The narrator can make or ruin an audible book, no matter how good it is.  Happily, Ray Porter is a genius at what he does.  His delivery is perfect and he does comedy very well.  I listened at 1.2x speed for it to sound natural to me.,,I loved it! I loved it as much as I loved The Martian! Simply Awesome! I will be recommending this book to everyone!,It's good. Downloaded yesterday and ten hours in a day later....hooked. Andy Weir has almost created a new genre...it's Science Fiction with emphasis on the Science'. Loved 'The Martian' - I think this is better. Can't wait for the film....in production now apparently.,Such a ride. I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs finished. A great mix of science and adventure and humour. Perfect narration.,This was an excellent tale of struggle, sacrifice, teamwork and friendship in the fight against world ending destruction. Both the story and performance of the audiobook were top calibre. A must read, particularly if you enjoyed The Martian.,Another great book!,I love that New Zealand got a mention!,Great narration as well.,That‚Äôs is my favourite Andy Weir book, and that‚Äôs saying a lot as I adored ‚Äúthe Martian‚Äù,another fantastically  written and read  book about space, science, the human psyche, and so much more.  i actually  find myself smiling and happy when Mr grace is happy. you can only get this with great writing . bravo. and please don't take too long  writing another  one of these marvels ."

It is very clever of David Gatward to make us care so deeply about a bunch of words but he does.,,Dark Harvest is a really cracking story, I zipped through it. It has plenty of twists and turns to keep you up way past your bedtime!

The Hunger Games: Special Edition,"Action & Adventure,Dystopian",Teen & Young Adult,"The Hunger Games trilogy has been important to me ever since the first movie came out. I loved the symbolism, the storytelling, the protagonist, and the metaphor for war. I love that the mental health impacts of oppression, traumatic loss, parental mental illness, and war are represented in a way that neither glosses over psychological and functional imparements nor turns mental illness into a plot device. I love the gender role flipping. And I love that such a hard story is written in a way that is compelling, exciting, brutal, and digestible for young and old alike.,,But when I bought the audiobook on sale a little while back, I was deeply disappointed. In this medium, the narrator can make or break the story, and the narrator they chose for the trilogy was all wrong for a trilogy that immerses readers so deeply inside of Katniss‚Äôs mind. Tatiana Maslany, however, is splendid. I know it was her first time narrating, and voice acting is so different from screen acting, but other than being a bit too breathy at times, I loved every minute. It was like rediscovering the joy of the Hunger Games all over again. I‚Äôm ten years older, but this story never gets old for me. It‚Äôs so important. I hope they bring Tatiana back to narrate the rest of the trilogy (hint hint).,,I also enjoyed the extras. One was a short interview with Tatiana, included after the final chapter, in which she answers questions about what the Hunger Games has meant to her and her experience narrating the first book. The other extra is a PDF downloadable from your library here on Audible‚Äôs website, which includes the transcripts of two interviews‚Äîone with Suzanne Collins done to celebrate ten years, and the second a forum with Suzanne and Walter Dean Meyers about the importance of writing war stories suitable for children and youth. The extras may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I loved them.,,Thank you to everyone who made this special edition happen. And, um... about the next two books... pretty pretty please?,THIS is the audio version I highly recommend.  I would avoid the other version that is almost painful to hear.  This version is worthy of the book.  I very much hope the remainder of the series will be rerecorded by this narrator - her performance is exceptional.,same great book but the version performed by Carolyn McCormick are better. took me a while to realize I was listening to Nadia from parks and rec.,i love this book! my only problem with it is the reader sounded so bored. they should have kept the original person reading instead cause i couldnt even make it to the games before i had to give up. sorry Tatiana, you need to add life to what you read or else you might just ruin it,My 14 year old son and I really enjoyed the story. We are excited for the rest of the trilogy. That said, I really struggled with the readers voices for the characters, I mean really struggled.,Its about time! Finally, someone has realized that having a good narrator is key to selling an audio book! I really hope that they release the rest of the series using Tatiana Maslany. She is absolutely what this book needed!,Unfortunately this special edition recording features a VERY obviously inexperienced audiobook narrator, who constantly hesitates, cannot seem to keep a consistent volume and sighs every few words. She also sounds out of breath most of the time.,I have loved these books for years. I heard this was an excellent audiobook so I bought it and I don't regret it at all. I truly hope she records the other two at some point because she gets it. The dialogue is perfectly executed, the voices are great. You feel it. Catherine McCormick is wonderful but she just doesn't pull off the teenager vibe. I'm sad I've finished it already! I guess I'll have to listen again!,I love Tatiana Maslany. The different voices she can do are so impressive. This recording sounds like there is an entire cast. I can‚Äôt even listen to the other recording ma of this series by the other narrator. I want more Tatiana!!,Amazing book but that narrator is hard to listen to. The voices she uses for Peeta and Haymitch are so irritating. There are times when Katniss is struggling through parts of the games and the narrator sounds constipated trying to convey the struggle-- i guess. I wish I‚Äôd bought a different version of this audio book. 10 hours of a girl trying to do boy/man voices and breathy straining. ugh.,I am no stranger to the books or the movies and I was disappointed after listening to the sample of the other narrator.,The story is one of my favourites and to hear Tatiana‚Äôs Katniss has added new depth.,I very much look forward to purchasing the next two audiobooks in the series once they have also been performed by Tatiana.,An excellent story. Thrilling from start to finish. Tatiana Maslany makes it that much better I think. I‚Äôm really hoping she does the next 2 books. I can‚Äôt bring myself to listen to the robot that performs the only available option for books 2 & 3!,Please have Tatiana Maslany read the rest of the series! The narration is miles better than the other version you have available. She actually sounds how Katniss should sound, rather than a robot!,Excellent narration! I much prefer it too the older audiobook. I am really hoping that they continue to work on the rest of the series!,This review is supposed to be optional! it isn't!!,all I can say is this narrator is awesome :) I can't stand the others, had to send them back! please have this narrator do the sequels and I'll buy them!!,The story has no real end. I feel left hanging like a turd. I want a conclusion now not in book 3 or something üò°,This story is amazing, every second of it is amazing and gripped me from the start. The performance of Tatiana was unbelievable and she was a big part of my enjoyment. Overall 5 stars üíú,really good book, had only seen the movies but really not disappointed!,absolutely love the narration, feels natural and the voice is really calming.,great job !,After listening to all three books which I thoroughly enjoyed; Downloading and listening to this version narrated by Tatiana Maslany was such a disappointment! It doesn‚Äôt even hold a candle to the vocal talents of Carolyn MaCormick. Got a refund on this just not worth buying.,Takes Me Back To When I Was A Teenager, The Feelings Are Honest, Raw & Heartfelt. I Really Enjoyed Coming Back To This World, I Can't Wait To Reread All Of The Books In The Series!,I listened to the entire book in two days and immediately jumped into Book 2 and 3.,Disney Pixar should be courting young Tatiana Maslany for a new project. Totally enchanting and igniting my imagination and memories of the movies.,Highly recommended.,Amazing story, amazing performance!,I‚Äôve read Hunger Games many times, but listening to the audiobook is a wonderful  experience.,Tatiana Maslany IS Katniss Everdeen.,Her performance is captivating and pulls you into the story even more. I cried my eyes out when she sung to ____.,I would definitely recommend everyone listen to this audiobook.,way better than the movie! Very engaging, emotional, thrilling and explored the entire thought process of Katniss through out the book. Great book!,The storyline is fairly good, but i found it difficult to relate to the self-absorbed, histrionic nature of the main protagonist. The narrator did such an excellent job of portraying the martyred tones of a bored millennial that I had to periodically turn the book off - it was driving me crazy!,The story is so powerful and with such emotion.,The performance captured perfectly the essence that is Katnis and was able seemlessly voice all other characters that it felt like a full cast.,I love that emotion was conveyed so brilliantly that I felt them so exactly.,This is simple the best audio book ever... the performance is just phenomenal and the story is enhanced by that, a story that is so amazing, hard hitting and so socially relevant I didn't know it could get better, but it did,excellent narration better than movie enjoyed the detail of the story telling and action yes,Tatiana Maslany was fantastic. I didn't know about her until I listened to this audiobook.,fantastic book, fantastic narrator. rue always gets the tears running and its nice hearing all the stuff they left out of the movie,Can‚Äôt help wondering how many readers or movie fans have realised this book is about us, in our time, in every era. The rich splashing money on pointless BS while people starve while making their extravagances for them. Best way to make people swallow a dark truth - write it as popular ‚Äòfiction‚Äô,Would 100% recommend this book and Tatiana did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life!!"

The Well of Ascension,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I just finished the third book.  The second is the slowest and least rewarding of the three, but the plot it provides makes the third book pretty incredible.  I would suggest that before purchasing this book that you commit to also listening to the third book.  If you liked the first book as much as I did, this would be a no-brainer.  If you didn't like the first book, I would certainly not recommend the Well of Ascension.,I am writing this after having finished the entire trilogy. While this was an incredible book and stands alone just fine on its own, I wanted to reserve judgement on each book till I finished the trilogy in order to put each one into perspective. This was my first Bandon Sanderson book and I loved it. At first, it was challenging to get into the whole concept of Allomancy but I eventually did and appreciated every aspect of this masterpiece. The books moved quickly, the story is rich in its treatments of many aspects personal character, politics, government, philosophy and religion. And each character is fully developed to the point where we probably care about all of them including some of the bad ones. The world created by Brandon Sanderson and stunningly narrated by Michael Kramer is not like any one I or probably any of us could have possibly imagined. As long as this trilogy was, I am so sorry to have it finally end.,Any additional comments?,You know, pointing out that the main character is an emotionally unstable teenage girl, and thus prone to making really stupid decisions, doesn't prevent it from being really damn annoying when she does make them.  Seriously, did we have to go with the cliche love triangle here?  And did we have to use the cliche trope of having each person having one particular bit of information that would solve their relationship issue, but by CRAZY COINCIDENCE, neither of them ever has the moment to tell the other about it?  So they both come away feeling rejected by the other, all over a bit of miscommunication and incredibly forced circumstances by the writer?   I really enjoy Brandon's work, and I've really enjoyed the series as a whole, but my god he hammers home this annoying, tired, played to death story device of pushing the characters into the 3rd act turmoil through relationship crap.  It's really annoying, and has directly caused me to give this story a rating of 3.,And Vinn's suffocating self-loathing is beyond tolerable, especially since it ends up driving the plot down some very stupid routes.  Seriously girl, go buy a Stabbing Westward cd and get over yourself.,The audio work by Michael Kramer is excellent as always, 5 stars there, but man, the crap with Vinn and Ellend is so....soap opera that I keep predicting where it's going next, because it's so transparent.   Ugh.,Not exactly sure why this book was titled Well of Ascension as only the last hour or so really pushes that plot point.  Most (98%) of the plot deals with somewhat repetitive politics and activities in Luthadell.  Most of the minimal lightness/funny moments from the first book are gone as the plot trudges through the normal middle book main character mental tortures so many trilogies follow these days.  Could have cut at least 8 hours in the plot and you'd never have noticed.,IF EVERYONE IS A NOBLEMAN, THAN THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NOBLEMAN,This is not book one. This meanders and is about 20 hours too long. If your short on cash and you want to listen to politics for hours, than this is the book for you. Me, I love Sanderson, but I am having lots of problems with his sequels.,Kramer, is great as usual,Loved the fantasy and action! Hated nearly everything else. Was expecting a book about adventure, fantasy, and heroics - like in the first book. Unfortunately got a book about politics, hapless romantics, and people who can't make up their minds. The story was also mostly predictable and hardly about the Well of Ascension... For the great narration and the bits of fantasy/action, I give this book three stars.,7-8 hours into this one... I realized that the story (so fascinatingly hinted at)... was moving at a snails pace. Why? Because we are learning SO MUCH about EVERY single character remaining from the Mistborn book....and we are spending SO MUCH time... reiterating what has passed. People. Not interested in the soap opera angle. And...maybe a short chapter at the start synopsizing everything would have been kinder. Ugh. Had to loose the book after 8 hours. That sucks. I REALLY ENJOYED the first book. Bigtime. Anyway. Form your own opinion. This is just mine.,Although the first book of the series moved slowly and contained too much detail to the point of confusion, it was a new story to me so I found the concepts interesting and even innovative enough to keep my attention. Unfortunately, there seemed to be the same amount or more of the repetitive details in this second volume about metals and long drawn out self reflective monologues that either made the character too dense or tedious. The basic plot and supernatural concepts were novel, but again they lost my interest while having to plod through all the extraneous details.,I enjoyed the first book in the series and was annoyed that I had to wait several months for the second one. Well the wait was worth it!,,The story begins with a year having passed since end of the last book. Sanderson deftly picks up where he left off, tying up loose ends and creating new twists.,,Michael Kramer does an excellent job of giving voice to the characters and creating a tapestry of the final empire from the books pages in the listener's mind. Switching between voices and emotions while keeping a netural narrative tone where appropriate makes the second book as much a pleasure as the first to listen to.,I was expecting the Well of Ascension to be more like more like the first book. It was very disappointing.  The trouble is, I can't tell you why if you haven't read the first in the series.  Its a big spoiler, but just imagine for a moment if you have finished book one, what would be missing.  Yes, what every your thinking, yes.,Also, you have to work through about 3 quarters of the book before you get to something that doesn't remind you of a bad tweenager throwing a pity tantrum.  Long sections of the story are just about characters who need to ""find them selves"" then ""decide if I'm good enough"" and ""look for a reason to go on"".  By the end you just want to shake every last character and tell them to stop moping and grow a pair.,The last 6 hours start to feel more like book one, things finally start moving.  Does move the narrative to and through interesting places, but the characters complain every step of the way.  The new insights into the world is very intriguing, and some of the scenes are very intense.  I just couldn't get over the annoying, annoying characters."
Exploring Home,"Dystopian,Military,Post-Apocalyptic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Thank you for keeping the storyline and characters. I‚Äôm anticipating the next book. Well done, Mr. A. American.,People learning how to live much like our great grandparents did after a emp burst,Picks up where last book left off - spoiler alert - it wasn‚Äôt a cliff hanger but certainly had unfinished business.,With all the crap they are putting on television. At least put something good on like this book series. I have been getting tired of television totally bored. This would be amazing for fit to be on air. looking forward to the next book. Hopefully it won't be as long of a wait. Trying to buy the entire series on paperback. Thank you for the entertaining story lines.,Love the series ‚Äî this one was by far the least action but still entertaining and insightful. The cliffhanger at the end guarantees I‚Äôll be back for book 13!,My all time favorite series. But man the last 10 minutes of this book was the best part! Hopefully book 13 will come sooner!,Lacking content just another hurry up go here kill this.  As good as the beginning of the series was it maybe time to wrap it up instead of dragging it out and ruining it completely.,Can‚Äôt wait for the next book. Please hurry up.  Right when the story was really picking up. Cliffhanger‚Ä¶,Can't wait for the next book in the series. I would recommend listening to the entire series in order.,Realistic story, need to add more bits for survival readiness and old remedies. Other than that I highly recommend this series.,love this series. its more than just shoot outs. there so much depth and you know the characters well.,Love the series, Duke does a wonderful job. Keep it coming! The only disappointing part to this book that it ended, So... is book 13 ready :)!! Sorry  I couldn't help myself.,I absolutely enjoyed this latest book and everything this author puts out, and I can't get enough.,I love this series,I love the characters,I hate waiting so long in between publications but understand authors have lives.,But to put out a book which is nearly a third from other books and some minimal additional storyline advancement just puffed out.,Sorely disappointed,Duke does an awesome job narrator's as always"

The Olympian Affair,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Steampunk",Literature & Fiction,"Mr Butcher, thank you for continuing this story. The characters are full of life.  The new characters are a wonderful addition. You are a story teller of the highest quality.,Only one request, please don't make us wait another 8 years for the next one. I'm 68 years old and I do want to know how this comes out.,I loved the first book and was very much looking forward to this one, but it doesn't feel the same.,The first is like a swashbuckling adventure novel with the action and story beats that go with it. The mysterious captain, the young up and comers, the enemy soldiers who are just doing their job and the evil leader with unknown motives. This one feels more like a Game of thrones knock off?  There's sex, backstabbing, political intrigue and I feel like too many pov characters. It has a very different feel to it and that isn't always a bad thing in a series, but this time it is.,I also feel like the characters are acting inconsistent with how they are established in the first book, one such example being the captain getting into a fist fight with one of his crew right off the bat. Another being the way the spire arc goes from being almost like a weird uncle you wouldn't guess to be anyone important at first glance to a cold calculating man who's eyes give nothing away? It feels like the author didn't remember how they were and just winged it based on vague ideas.,Sorry if this seems like I'm ranting, but I'm just very disappointed. I've listened to the first book multiple times and have suggested it several people. I won't be doing the same with this one.,P.s  The performance is great, just wish he had better material to work with.,I think Aeronauts Windlass is one of the best books I have ever read.  It was subtle in humor, magic, and character interaction.  it was funny and sometimes poignant.   This follow up book does not seem to be written by the same author.  It meanders terribly and the characters act completely out of character.  Much of it was extremely predictable with very heavy foreshadowing of the next interaction between characters. Added to that was a greater fixation on whom was having sex with whom, something that was not in the first book.  The humor was also heavy handed and therefore not funny. Oh well.  I still like this author and it wasn't the worst book I have ever read.  i just will never recommend either book to anyone.,This book suffers from traditional Jim Butcher issues in so far as the fact that it's not a Dresden Files book. The main issue with this book is the few inconsistencies between the previous story and this one. The Perilous incident for example doesn't match up with the info given in the first book. Like at all. It feels like Jim didn't actually go back over his first book before he wrote this one. There's a few other minor ones but they're not really important. Of a more personal complaint, Gwen has been relegated to being a side character. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very enjoyable book. Just don't take half a decade to write the next one and not actually review your previous works to make sure everything stays consistent.,I quit after 10 hours. It felt like a slog and never really grabbed me with the characters or story.,I have pre-ordered ALL of Butcher's books since I read the first Dresden Files book. I  cannot recall reading one of his books and wondering how much more I can take before  this one. It's like a high school author's first book if that author wanted to write a romance novel set on pirate ships. It's also a mash up of fantasy and (very sort of) sci fi. At the same time, it has the feel of a Renaissance Festival with cheesy overperformance, humor,  and ""we're all in on the joke except for those people over there, but someone has to buy wildly overpriced turkey drumsticks"". None of the various elements feels organic and they fit together with an awkwardness that makes me feel uncomfortably like I did when a good friend in high school asked me to read a book she'd been working on for years and it was really, REALLY terrible.,I have always enjoyed Jim Butcher, but as hard as I try to get into this book it feels like someone who read all of his books but has MUCH LESS skill wrote this. My apologies, but this simply is not a good book. It's very obviousf that, if he actually wrote this, his heart just wasn't in this book. I'm hanging in there for more talking cat scenes- cats are woefully underutilized as characters in fiction writing. If they can't carry the story any better than the characters who are so forgettable that I cannot recall a single one at the moment, I am going to have to abandon ship.,I'll 100% still pre-order Butcher's next book. I held out through some pretty terrible Stephen King books, too. People go through rough patches and writers are people, too. They get better, sometimes.,‚ÄúTo will, skill and steel!‚Äù,All my favorites from book 1 are back (Mr. Kettle!) and a few fabulous new characters join the fray (notably, the Duchess and her Commodore). This one has a lot of separately moving parts, but I enjoyed the way they overlap, circle back and complicate the power dynamics. I love that there are shades of gray in characters on both sides. And whoo, Ms. Cavendish is exactly the kind of ruthless, scary adversary that I love to hate. Steampunk, swashbuckling, monsters, and mayhem ‚Ä¶ all brought to life with Mr. Morton‚Äôs phenomenal narration. And cats. Of course. Can‚Äôt forget the cats.,Captain ransom makes little sense as a character. The whole arc on the mistshark makes little sense, and the chronology seems extremely strange ( Albion spire arc timing seems very odd ‚Äî it apparently takes longer to go down a spire than go to a different spire ?? ),I love Jim Butcher's character development! I love the world he created in this series. I just wish his books were never ending! I would love to read storys everyday about the characters in this book!! I want more! Can't wait for the next!,p.s the narration is perfection! Euan I could listen to you all day!,Mr butcher has become something of a d* * k. I'm quite tired of finding myself in the position where I'm in serious danger of shedding some tears when reading his books. I am quite a fan of this story in particular and though it appears to have come out well before I ever came across it I do have pretty good memories about going through the first book. I had just started a new job and was still in training and at lunch time would walk around the campus listening to this book. It was so very good and I had hoped that the sequel would be right around the corner. Since then not only have I moved on from that job having trained others to replace me but I've had the time to go back to college to obtain my bachelor's degree and am a few weeks from finishing. I say this only to give some perspective of exactly how much time has passed since the first book and this one here now. The novella was pretty cool if some what annoying for its Cliffhanger ending though I did not start reading it until this one was due to be released the following day. I will say it true that I finished this book in one long sitting. I fear though that the sequel may be years in coming and so departing from my normal MO when it comes to leaving a review I will simply an entirely refrain from discussing anything in the book. I do not think anyone reading this review will regret picking up this book. It is a wonderful story and the cat Warriors are as Charming as ever. I eagerly look forward to the sequel. Lastly, I will simply say Well done to everybody who had a hand in bringing the story to us, the readers and audiobook listeners.,Absolutely loved it. Hard to believe there was so much time between the first and this one. More please...and soon!"
Rhythm of War,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The characters have been battling their emotions and their pasts for several books now. Instead of progress past these issues they continue to get worse and these issues are brought up non stop. It annoying and makes for a very slow story. I‚Äôm so sick of Kal‚Äôs dad. His is content to being a slave. His not going to be happy until Kal becomes a surgeon. Otherwise Kal‚Äôs just worthless to him.,I was really looking forward to this book. I‚Äôve read some of the other reviews and like always their are those who give 5 star rating just because they like the author. They are just fanboys. This book just isn‚Äôt as good as the other books in this series. I‚Äôm not reading this book to learn about PTSD or schizophrenia. The author is getting lost in the details of his story and in doing so, is losing the thread of the story.,I understand that I‚Äôll be among the few bad reviews for this book but I‚Äôm use to Brandon‚Äôs other books were I don‚Äôt want to set down the book until I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm struggling to finish this book because all I want to do is just delete the book.,,I have to say, I am very disappointed with this book. Too many characters having the same issues that they were having from the last books. Sanderson seemed to take a plot that should of taken maybe only 1/4 of the book and forced it to cover all the book. Really spent most of the book wanting to fast forward to the end. It is rare in a book when you wish the main character would just die so you can just get on with the story.,I had extremely high hopes coming off the fantastic Words of Radiance and Oathbringer, so Rhythm of War had big shoes to fill. Unfortunately it does not, and instead falls prey to the bloat that faces many similar series such as The Wheel of Time and A Song of Ice and Fire. While it starts off strong, it loses steam around chapter 10 and then plods along until around the mid-90s. If you were hoping to see the Coalition's war against Odium and the Fused, you will be disappointed. Sanderson instead deals with two of the main characters retreading their personal issues despite the outcomes being forgone conclusions to anyone who has stuck with the series thus far. New main PoV characters Venli and Navani are a mixed bag. While they shine early on, they quickly turn into delivery systems for Sanderson to info dump about the past, present, and potential future of the series. I think both of these character's arcs would have been more interesting if they did not share the same present day setting/situation of several other PoV characters.,,Sanderson has a habit of packing an incredible amount of content into the climaxes of his books, and RoW is no exception. The difference is that in RoW he uses this to pull of a case of storytelling legerdemain; what you've spent 50 hours listening to thus far was all in service of distracting you from one singular moment. I would compare it to the last season of the Game of Thrones series, in which scenes are delivered for shock and awe, rather than in service of the story. It is not what happens nor when, but how, and the lead up (or almost lack there of) that disappoints. Worst of all is the epilogue in which a character, who may as well be acting as an author insert, gloats about misdirection, story telling, and dirty tricks.,,I would have taken a star off for Performance because while Kate Reading and Michael Kramer themselves are fantastic, what ever recording equipment Michael was using was not. The audio on his voice is notably bad when he used several ""stressed/intense"" voices. However this could easily due to the pandemic and RoW is a massive undertaking, so I will give them 5/5.,,In conclusion, while I will certainly read the next book in the Stormlight series, Rhythm of War feels like a massive red flag about what is to come in terms of storytelling quality. Hopefully Sanderson returns to form, because looking back RoW feels like only the destination mattered, not the journey.,Really should have stopped at ""The Way of Kings"" but I didn't.,,I get it, Sanderson really likes damaged characters.  But, if I wanted to be confronted with dysfunctional people beating the dead horse of their crappy childhoods for endless hours I'd go to work.  SooOOoo .. .        . Long.  SooOOoo .. .           . Whiny.,,I'm just done.,I love these books and I loved how they included a pdf version of the artwork with the audio book for the previous books but for some reason they didn‚Äôt include it this time,How are the reviews for this book so good? I'm a huge Brando Sando homer and I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. This was EASILY the worst book of his that I have ever read and I've read them all. Even White Sand. I read Way of Kings and Words of Radiance 4 times. I read Oathbringer 3 times... I don't see myself reading this again. Maybe part 1 and 5 but there's no way I'm wading through parts 2-4 ever again. Because 2 out of 5 parts were actually readable, I'm giving it 2 out of 5 stars.,,1. I realize it's a long series, but whenever you think there's a pivotal character development moment, it just gets erased. Let me preface this by saying I'm a pharmacist who's spent a whole lot of extra time in psychiatric care post graduation. Mental health is an under-served population but I'd like to think heroes from my book would embody the best virtues of broken people. I know plenty of real people who deal with chronic depression and some of them have learned to deal with it in a very healthy way. I used to love Kaladin. Now he just drives me crazy... Kaladin restores bridge 4's will to live. Kaladin saves Dalinar et al in book 1. Kaladin does cool wall jumping and flying in the caverns in book 2 and feels free. Kaladin realizes other people have hurts but persevere from Shallan in book 2. Kaladin does what's right and swears the 3rd ideal at the end of book 2. Kaladin wants to give up, gets saved by Dalinar, but still picks himself up and guards Dalinar while fighting Amaram at the end of book 3..... Kaladin's sad and mopey and whiny and JUST SO TIRED for the billionth time in book 4. In the finale, Kaladin again just felt so tired and I literally screamed in my car. Shouldn't he be improving? Gaining perspective? Keeping the here and now in view? If he's developed completely and the only way to develop him more is to un-develop him so he can redevelop, maybe it's time for a new viewpoint character. Or kill him. Or shorten the series by a book. Or don't use him as a viewpoint character for a book so you don't have to deal with a fully developed protagonist. This doesn't feel like development anymore. This feels like a revolving door of the same issues. Maybe a more appropriate title would have been ""Rhythm of Recurring Mental Illnesses"",,2. As previously mentioned, I'm a pharmacist. Occasionally I read scientific studies. They. Are. Boring. Necessary, but boring. READING the studies is boring. Doing the actual studying? More boring. READING A FANTASY NOVEL WHERE ONE OF THE MAIN PLOT LINES IS FOLLOWING SOMEONE DOING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON CONCEPTS RELATED TO PHYSICS?!?!?!?!?!??! KILL ME NOW. ""Rhythm of scientific studies and the publication of said literature utilizing a Cox Regression Model"" sounds a lot less cool than Rhythm of War but it's a lot more accurate.,,3. I just passed the AZ-MPJE, also known as the Arizona Pharmacy Law Exam. Studying for it? Boring. 20 hours of studying, 0 hours of fun. Boring, mind numbing, and tedious. Another major plot line of this novel? STUDYING FOR THE HONOR SPREN BAR EXAM!? Are. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me. The actual bar exam itself felt like there was this cool idea where we'll put So and So (spoiler free, because maybe some people are into this crap?) into a situation that they're not competent in to put them off balance! What will be the arguments brought against him? Just one. Couldn't think of more. So lets just make that one argument like 20 different times from a few different people. Also, Honor Spren and Ink Spren REALLY don't like each other. Because reasons. But they really don't like each other. It'd take too much time to get into the why so you'll just have to take our word for it. 57 hours of audio book and 15 minutes couldn't be spared to explain this.,,4. *****SPOILER ALERT*****. Big spoiler. Spoilers from here on out Though if you're reading this you're one of the 4% who, like me, are trying to find at least a few people who don't get all the love this book is getting so you're probably already aware.... Taravangian becomes Odium and continues to perpetuate Odium's war? I thought he wanted to save everyone. Easy way to save everyone would be to order a cease to all hostilities and appoint a chicken (actual, not a parrot like most chickens are) with cancer to be his champion. Boom. Everyone saved.,,5. As soon as Navani suggested Rlain to bond with the sibling, I knew it wouldn't happen. It was my theory that that's what would bring the singers and humans together. A 50/50 split of bondsmiths? That would show that the singers can be equal to humans moving forward! Nope. Instead, the Kholin's just became the Kennedy/Bush/Clinton family of Roshar. They have a monopoly of Bondsmiths, 2 out of the 4 monarchs in the coalition, and a high prince. The lowest of their family is a radiant. My friend had a theory that Dabbid would be the one to bond the sibling. I thought that could be cool too. Fix his brain and maybe his uniting instead of dividing would be the minds of things. Then he could fix up crazy fused and they'd be like ""whoa, now that I'm rational, maybe murdering each other sucks and we should work towards a peace accord."" But no. Instead we get the geopolitical super family and Navani's bonded to a giant fabrial -_-,,I should probably move on with my life so I'll stop now. I didn't like it. I won't read it again. It's shattered my trust in Brandon Sanderson as an author. A year of anticipation that ended in frustration, annoyance, and disappointment,Upsides: for once there‚Äôs a few somewhat big action scenes and deaths in part one... a departure from Sanderson‚Äôs love of keeping the big reveals, actions, deaths for the last 10%. Also, no more Dalinar flashbacks. I enjoyed the stories for Adalin, Rilayne, and Dabbid (probably spelling these wrong).,,Downsides: Missing a lot of Bridge 4 (no Lopin or Roc, boo!). Big chunks focus on Shallan, Navani, and Venli, and all three have long, angst filled storylines where no one progresses until the last 10%  (Yep, the leopard can‚Äôt completely change his spots). Kaladin is present throughout, but with the same retreads of his self flagellation and father-son conflict.,,Worst-side: What could have been a great series leading to a climactic world-wide conclusion in book 5 instead undoes much of the series progress here by switching to a universe-wide series... and forecasting entirely new plots, heroes, villains, and Cosmere tie-ins. I feel like I‚Äôve invested 200 hrs in a series, only for Wit/Hoyt to inform me that it was just a story he was telling within the real book... and that book only begins in the final hour of book 4 (I know how much Sanderson and his fans love Wit, but I just find him to be a sanctimonious cheat of a plot device). This book is for fan boys / girls to geek out over the callbacks and connections to Sanderson‚Äôs other series.  I wish Sanderson would stop trying to impress me with the size of his Cosmere and stick to the fantastic story of Roshar.,Not in the same league as past Stormlight novels. The plot is incoherent, there‚Äôs very little action, and absolutely no resolution to the overall plot line. This is a 2.5-star book, despite the myriad positive reviews written by BS fanboys/girls.,If you‚Äôre already invested in the story, then it‚Äôs worth a listen; however, do not go into it with high expectations. Also note: approximately 26 hours is focused on Chalon‚Äôs multiple multiple multiple personalities ‚Äî Boring and annoying.,The entire book is worthy of only 2.5/3-stars. The narration is superb, 5-stars.,100% best narration!,Phenomenal story.,The Accompanying PDF is missing (book #3) had one. Fix for 5 stars,So sick of the mental issues these characters deal with. It‚Äôs non-stop. This book is a complete waste and was written for the money only. I‚Äôm returning it and the hardcover book."
He Who Fights with Monsters 2,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"First: I loved this book. The narrator is seriously epic, really brings the characters personalities to life. I listened to the whole book in 3 days and the ending is an amazing yet infuriating having me loving and hating the author, while begging for the next book to know what happens next.,Second: I find that when I read reviews more often than not its the people who don‚Äôt have anything nice to say that shouts the loudest - Thadwick Mercer being a good example üòÇ,So when I give my review I want to address what I have seen from negative remarks as well as my own opinion.,I loved this book, it drags you in and there is always something going on keeping you entertained, I love Jason, the character had a refreshing not the perfect good guy hero attitude despite being the main character- ‚Äúi am who i am, take it or leave it‚Äù,There is one comment you see a lot in reviews ‚Äúeveryone becomes Jason‚Äù and i find both exaggeration and understanding in this comment. The reason i do somewhat are to the statement os a spoiler I wont say, but if people or powers become to similar it can be somewhat annoying since how the different character work together to use their different skills as a team is the entire point. No they don‚Äôt all become Jason, I find that to be a somewhat exaggerated comment.,Sure there may be a similarity to a power here or there like Sophie and Jason‚Äôs fighting style, but the characters have their own personalities. They may learn to joke with him like friends grow from spending time together that is not the same thing as becoming the same person.,My conclusion is it was definitely worthwhile to read and i listened to the audiobook which I have to say is absolutely amazingly narrated. I finished the whole book in 3 days listening to it until 2am every night before forcing myself to put it down.,loved the book not cool with the cliffhanger. Wish I would have waited for book 3 before I started this one.,Ok so I do a lot of Audible.   This particular series has had me from the beginning.   In fact recently towards the end of book 2 my wife almost died because of it!!!!!    Yes really!!   Let me paint a picture of a man out side the back door but still in the door frame .   I had 1 AirPods in my ear. I was so into what was going on I didn‚Äôt hear my wife choking behind me.   My kids yelled for me to help but to no avail.  I was only worried about what was happening at that time in the book.  But I turn around at the exact  moment it clears her throat passages and she breaths.....    of course the rest was not pretty but I no longer listen to it at home.     I preordered book 3.  A week after book 2 dropped.  I have since then had my wife listen to the books and thank God she got it.  When the baby wrote all over the wall!!!!     I thank you for this adventure so far can‚Äôt wait for 3!!!,Seriously,  Throughout the beginning of the book replace Jason's name with one of the other female characters in his interactions with Sophie and suddenly you see her in a totally different light.  This is a person who got handed to them for free something like 10 times the reward that 3 high ranking adventurers with a gold ranker for a backer viewed as adequate payment for saving their lives.  Remember Farra only gave Jason 1 stone as thanks and he gave Sophie something like 8 because?  At first it seemed reasonable but as the gifts to her kept stacking up it just became stupid.  I'm only 1/3rd through the book and I'm not sure I can finish.  How much of everything is adequate to give this woman?  At first he spoke about her paying him back but then that went away as he kindly plays banker for her.  Why doesn't the heads of the great houses come down and just give everything to her?  On and on the story goes about how much of a human trash Jason is at times yet he keeps having to sacrifice for her because......?  He has already given her the same treatment that the highest ranking nobles have given their children.  The same treatment that the lower rich go into debt to do for their children. Yet he gives it to her and more and she gets one? scolding for not being nice.  Im sorry but if someone got that kind of gift from a friend of mine and treated them like garbage afterwards I wouldn't put up with it.,The only reason I have got this far is because I really like the first one but as the story twists to, ""Everything for Sophie"" mode it just makes me want to put it down.,So-- the books are okay.  They are well written and the dialogue can be fun and witty.  The narrator is solid and has lots of varied voices and inflections.,,Its a solid 3 stars - and I mean FIRMLY 3 stars because it is clunky and trips over itself.  The author spends far too much time preaching about his philosophy on how EARTH works.  This isn't Earth so the interdimensional traveling Aussie just comes across as a know-it-all douche bag.  He has a firm sense of himself - far too much for someone whose body was recently destroyed and remade in another dimension and was (by his own account) practically an inexperienced loser in his old life..  He preaches to those who have been alive hundreds of years.  He catches gods and near immortals off guard and dances circles around them because the author is too in love with his young star to make him a bit more realistic.  Nothing from the story suggests that he was granted some insight into the world by being remade in this new land so ... how is he the most mysterious being ever? *shrug*,,I came for the LITRPG aspect and the monster fighting.  The two books have a fair amount of those elements but mostly its Asano monologuing to goddesses and preaching his atheism to actual gods or trying to show up people left and right.  Its off-putting.  It makes him less likable.  He is a 23/24 year old kid with little to no actual life experiences yet he preaches like he knows it all and for some reason people actually listen.,,If you enjoy 40% city politics.  25% LiTRPG Power Upgrading and about 35% actual monster fighting.  This is your book.  If not - maybe pass.,,All of that said - I'll be buying the 3rd book.  Its entertaining and you get a lot of audio book for your buck.,This book stays true to the feel of the first. The character development is deep and meaningful and the politics are rich and complex. The main character is witty as usual with his antics racking up more and more trouble. I can't wait to see what will happen next!,I will update when I am done but this might be the last book of the series I read. The performance I enjoy but I have been listening for over an hour and a half and I can only compare it to when you write an essay and need to get up to the word count. I have spent the whole time listening to people explain abilities or leveling up which was done in the first book and how the attack does or doesn't do something. Instead of saying he stabs her and dodges and stabs her again causing bleed to he stabs her slicing damage does not take affect slices again and slice damage takes affect and stacks one affect of something has been applied. I did enjoy the first book but having a really hard time finishing this one I would save the credit alot of great books out there.,This was a big step down from the first book for me. Here‚Äôs why:,1) my favorite part of the first book was the adventure and action. I enjoyed the battles and monster hunts. There is very little of that in this book. There is literally zero action until chapter 19, and that‚Äôs over 10 hours into the audio book.,2) the social justice speeches of the MC are turned way down, but he‚Äôs still pretty insufferable in that he knows exponentially more about the world he‚Äôs just arrived in than anyone who lives there. He comes off as unendingly patronizing.,3) this book is all about politics and the fantasy science of astral spaces. The first 10 chapters are character dialogue laying out the politics of the adventurers guild, magic guild, rich family and church. After that, there is a lot of explaining about astral spaces. None of it is badly done. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, it‚Äôs probably a strength.,4) the number of characters in this book is huge. They also start to sound similar before too long.,5) there is no ending to this book. It‚Äôs a complete stop mid-stream.,On the up side, the limited action that is in this book is really good, and the leveling system is still very creative and unique. If the next book ends the series, I‚Äôll pick it up. If it‚Äôs another cliff hanger like this, I‚Äôll probably pass.,After listening to book 1, and loving it, I had a lot of expectations going into this one and it met everyone of them. This book delivered on everything, and more, that I was hoping for. Just saw that book 3 is in pre-order for Kindle and plan on paying it. Can't wait for it to come on audible, though I know it'll be sometime before that.,It‚Äôs really good so far and and looking forward for the third book just hope he keeps up the good quality.,This is not a great work of art. It is however very entertaining.  It is ideal to listen to while doing chores.  The overall tone is light and funny.  Heath's performance is spot on apart from a few mispronunciations, which had me thinking for a while. (Atrium, Invigilator, reconnoitre). Overall a nice long book and well worth the money. I am looking forward to the next one.,After reading some of the reviews I was in two minds as to whether I'd enjoy this book. I'm so glad I gave it a try. Yes the writing can be a bit clunky at times, but it doesn't ruin the storyline or immersion in the world building.,Many of the reviews said that their problem was how snarky Jason was and many of the other characters just became versions of Jason. I wonder if this is a cultural thing. in the UK this kind of sarcastic banter is an essential skill!,I really enjoyed the story and the narrator. The only reason it didn't get 5stars is because The Wandering Inn set the bar unbelievably high!,And as always excellent narration by Heath Miller only problem is that I have to wait another 3 months for the next one,a deeply unlikeable MC who thinks he's great while be a horrible person. I'm happy when he off screen and wany to drop the book every time he opens his mouth to go on another rant.,Entertaining story with extremely likeable characters and great voice acting. Can't wait for book 3.,This book is as good as the first. Really can‚Äôt wait for the next one!! Writing is great and so is the performance.,5 stars!,Loved it! if you liked the first then you will absolutely like the second. So don't put it off and do yourself a favour by listening to this fantastic book.,EPIC EPIC EPIC!!! On to book 3 IMMIDIATELY!!! Excellent narrator as well!! Loving LITRPD as a genre but especially Jason‚Äôs journey!!,Love this! The action is exciting and the characters interact in a fun and charming way. It has a good quick pace and memorable characters.,Once again a great story with a fun main character, a little more of a political story showing a little more of the organisations & big names in the books that jason bumps heads with. Its a mix of fun adventure with  political intrigue (not too much to be boring),I loved HWFM 1 and had to immediately reread it and could hardly wait for this one. Now I've got to wait until September for the next installment. I don't know how I'll manage!,Having said all that, this book was not up to the standard of the first one., and I was annoyed at the cliffhanger ending.,Shade is supposed to have a British accent, but the narrator does not give him one. The narrator need to work on pronunciations. Particularly of concern were the words scythe and invigilator, but there were others not quite as grating.,What a fun and enjoyable story. Has a very Australian sense of humor and drama.,Strewth! This is a good book! Where's no. 3?!? Absolutely loving this series, well worth a read guys!,One of the better litrpg books series iv had the pleasure of coming across. Good story combined with a excellent narrator, highly recommend.,Love this series so much. The whole concept of the magical world is really well described and fascinating to listen to. It‚Äôs light and funny, but the characters are complex and interesting. The humour is fantastic, definitely more on point in book 2. Great cliffhanger ending. I disagree with the other reviews on this point. I‚Äôm just sad I have to wait until September for the next book!!!,Doesn‚Äôt get much better than this. Heath Miller is a fantastic narrator and really brings the characters to life.,Not as good as book 1 a little more action and a little less stats would have been nice, but I‚Äôll give book three a go willingly,Another amazing installment from this series. Had me in even more stitches than the first book. I was walking through a shopping centre laughing out loud like a weirdo listening to this book. 100% recommend. Again well done!,really loving this series,  the story , proformance and humour is on point . I would add it to the must have list,Easy listening all round. Nothing too heavy, enough going on to keep you interested, lots of funny moments the narrator delivery flawlessly:)"

I‚Äôm glad I listened to it. The narration fit the story and I enjoyed it.,A very slow start, but not objectionable. What lost me was when the characters finally reached Germany, where the author bombards the listener with tropes and unrealistic scenes.,This book had a good amount of twists and  turns to keep me listening.  I found the romance between the two main characters boring..rolled my eyes.."

My two children love stories, and when your running low with books on the shelf who comes to the rescue? So many wonderful stories 5-7 minutes long. When you hear a story about momma dragon teaching delicious foods or the smells and tastes of refreshment. Such an enriched vocabulary throughout the book.

Highly recommend this audiobook!,These stories are excellent for children who are anxious, worried, shy, or timid.

These stories are very relatable and have built-in strategies for helping children remain calm, get out of their comfort zone, increase their emotional IQ, or self-regulate.  These stories are diverse and entertaining enough that any child would enjoy them, even those without specific stressors.  The only thing that detracted a little bit is that a few of the stories include some words or strategies that younger children may not be familiar with, so adults will want to listen along with their children to help them better understand and to reinforce self-help strategies.,Just started using this for my kid's bedtime routine, and it's pretty chill.

The Two Towers,"Classics,Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"Rob Inglis, the old Recorded Books LOTR reader, sings very nicely the many songs in the text, enhancing the listener‚Äôs enjoyment.,For some reason, the producer of this new Recorded Books LOTR thought that Andy Serkis should sing the poems.  He is a brilliant actor and reader, but his singing is painful to listen to and really detracts from  my enjoyment of the recording.,I love Tolkien & it is hard for me to admit defeat but this audio book was not my cup of mead.  I chose this version based on stellar reviews and was looking forward to this performance.  I gave up somehere in Fangorn.  I just downloaded the earlier version.,,My criticism involves the following:,,Aragorn 'whispers' or speaks with a downward breathy tone that to me sounds very undecided or morose.  I hear Aragorn as a much more forceful character than this Narrator provides. No hero this chap.,,The gutteral Orc speech is way over the top.,,Gimli the dwarf is the loudest & most irritating Scotsman I could ever conjure.,,The twig that broke the camels back was the Treebeard dialogue.  Yes I understand that Ents speak in a slow and deliberate basso voice but my goodness this idea was taken 70,000 Ent strides too far.  This ended up being a joke that was taken way way too far.,,Treebeard singing was painful.  I cannot sing a lick in tune but hey I would have pushed HARD for a professional singer to take over this task.,,The story is pure magic.  I believe it deserves a better performance,,,,,I have read the Lord Of The Rings many times and have listened to several audio recordings.  This one by Andy Serkis is by far the best.  Aside from the great work on the multitude of voices, what stands out are the songs.  Andy gives each song it‚Äôs own flavor and character.  It is truly remarkable and makes a case that these books are made better with the audio recording.,Just wow. Andy Serkis  does a stunning reading of LoTR. If you haven‚Äôt read it, are a enthusiast, an Andy Serkis fan, or if you have a few spare credits pick this up!,The Two Towers will stand out. Gollum spends the most time in the trilogy. It‚Äôs music for ear holes.,I will never again listen to another version of LotR. Andy Serkis truly brings the characters to life.,I can't believe one man did all these voices. Most of the time I forgot I was listening to a book. Instead, I was off sharing an adventure with some familiar friends in Middle Earth.,,Andy Serkis is the perfect narrator!  My only complaint is the song of the Entwives, that was pretty painful to listen to.,Andy Serkis is made of solid gold! This reading of The Lord of the Rings is amazing.,Exceptional performance by Andy Serkis!! He brought forth all the emotions I had in my initial reading of Tolkien's books many decades ago. very grateful to him!,This is, truly, the Best series I‚Äôve ever experienced.

After the Storm,Contemporary,Romance,",God I am a sucker for Jacob Morgan! Take all my money take all my time, I don‚Äôt even care anymore.,Let me start by saying the Reynolds Family dynamic is what family goals are made of.,The epic text messaging chain they have made me love these characters even more!,I had literal chills starting this audiobook knowing that this was going to be my favorite of the series. All of the books in the Cottonwood Cove series are amazing but I have patiently waited for Cage‚Äôs story. This story is about Cage Reynolds and Presley Duncan. A second chance romance, with a single dad to the most adorable daughter, Gracie.,When Presley came back into Cage‚Äôs life I really appreciated the honesty these two lead with, knowing they had feelings and acknowledging them made you understand how deep their true love was. The two of them had such an emotional journey growing up together, going to college and then having to part ways, and this book captures all the feels listening to it.,Cage‚Äôs daughter Gracie was the cutest book daughter ever and the way Presley just jumped in and loved her right away was very special.,Cage had the most adorable banter and sarcastic jokes towards his daughter and the things kids do, I laughed so hard. This book was so incredible to listen to that I know reading a physical copy would be just as amazing. It was a book with great relationships outside of Cage and Presley, where people really cared for them, gave each of them amazing advice and let them find their way back to each other again, but for forever this time,,Audiobook Review üéß (ALC),4.5üåü,Narrators: Emma Wilder & Jacob Morgan,,Tropes,-Small Town Romance,-Single Dad,-Second Chance Romance,-Its Always Been You,,Second chance romance is not usually my favorite trope, but Laura Pavlov may have converted me!,I was so thrilled to listen to the final book in the Cottonwood Cove series because I had been highly anticipating Cage (grumpy veterinarian & single dad!),The writing was very well done! Lots of showing and light on ""telling"" how each character behaved.,My favorite parts of the story were, of course little Gracie, the pets who make Cage absolutely crazy , the Reynolds siblings group chat and the romance!,I grew up watching The Notebook and it felt so reminiscent of that, it really pulled at my heart! I liked that they didn't spend the first part of the book avoiding each other, it helped the story have good pacing.,,The narrators were top tier! Jacob Morgan was able to balance Cage's grumpiness with his love for his daughter and family. His comedic timing was perfect and the way he did the voices of all the different characters when they were in the same scene was perfection!,Emma Wilder's ""man voice"" was just freaking hot! She also was able to show so much emotion from Presley as she struggled with her divorce and relationship with her mom and dad.,It was a wonderful performance!,,It was a perfect ending to a great series. I'm so glad Laura Pavlov was able to do simultaneous release with the ebook & paperback so us audiobook girlies could get in on the excitement!,,Thank you to Valentine PR for the free audiobook. All opinions are my own.,I may have just found a new favorite author! This series was engaging, entertaining, and sucks you in at the beginning. I can‚Äôt wait for more books!,4.5...They've all found love! I loved reading all the Reynolds love stories. I had really looked forward to this one. It wasn't my favorite series by Laura but it was still pretty good overall. The sibling banter was comical and enjoyable. I expected Cage to be funnier as he was a grumpy sarcastic hoot in the past books. He kind of made me mad in the end just giving up so easily and I think she took him back too easily and should have made him grovel a bit more. First sign of a little trouble in his life and he basically discarded her like yesterdays trash. It was still a cute story though and I had been most looking forward to him finding love since he was the oldest and had a dry sense of humor that I enjoyed. It didn't come out as much in this book as it did in past books though unfortunately. I liked this FMC though. She was fairly mature and seemed to take most things in stride; she just longed to be loved and to be chosen and once again he didn't choose her, until he did. After everything she's went through and all her heartbreak and life growing up feeling a bit unloved, I expected more from the MMC. That's why I knocked off .5 points. His daughter was a doll though as she was in all the other books from the series. I think Brinkley's story was my favorite because she was so feisty and has a good sense of humor. Narration was great and I would recommend this book to friends. Worth the money!,I have been waiting for grumpy Daddy Cage‚Äôs book and I devoured it once I started it. ‚ÄúAfter the Storm‚Äù is an emotional, fun, and heartfelt second chance single Dad romance that wrapped up the Cottonwood Cove Series perfectly.,Cage is a veterinarian and a single Dad to his daughter, Gracie. His days are busy, and his nights are lonely. When his first and only love, Presley, comes back to Cottonwood Cove to help care for recovering father, he has mixed feelings on it. Presley is successful lawyer but isn‚Äôt happy overall. She‚Äôs in the process of divorcing and just needs a reset. Cage and Presley still have many unresolved feelings and a chemistry that never fizzled out after they broke up years ago.,I love a grumpy single Dad and Cage was grumpy perfection. After losing Presley when he was younger, he built a wall around himself. The only person allowed behind the wall was Gracie who is truly the light of his life. Even with the wall built, he has such a big heart and is a sweet guy. I loved Presley‚Äôs independence and how she dropped everything to help her Dad. She‚Äôs so genuine and I love how she fell instantly for Gracie. They had a special bond from the beginning, and it just shined throughout the story. Gracie is such a cute kid and such a great addition to the story. And I loved all the text exchanges between Cage and siblings, they had me cracking up.,I loved listening to Jacob Morgan and Emma Wilder narrate Cage and Presley, they were the perfect choices. Jacob narration as the grumpy, protective, and sweet Cage was perfect and he has such a cute kid voice. I loved Emma as Presley, she brought all her emotions alive perfectly.,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always just been you and me.‚Äù,,After the Storm was my first book by Laura Pavlov and I‚Äôm hooked! Laura‚Äôs writing flows beautifully, weaving heartache and relatable experiences into swoon-worthy, small-town romance. Cage & Presley were high school sweethearts torn apart by distance and college life. Now Cage is a single dad to darling five-year-old Gracie and Cottonwood Cove‚Äôs heartthrob veterinarian. Presley is a big-city, high-powered attorney about to make partner. Returning home amid a public breakup to care for her father, Presley dreads running into Cage. This audiobook had me roaring with laughter, sobbing from the heartache, and swooning from all the hometown heart.,,Emma Wilder and Jacob Morgan make such a dreamy narrating duo! Emma‚Äôs portrayal of Presley‚Äôs sweet and stubborn character was lovely. Jacob embodied the grumpy, seductive single dad, Cage perfectly. Emma and Jacob brought Laura‚Äôs story to life beautifully. I can‚Äôt wait to revisit Cottonwood Cove from the beginning.,,I did not expect to sob my way through the last hour of this book! it was beautiful and the narration was perfect.,After the storm is right person wrong time and two very stubborn people who loved each other that made decisions that kept them apart until they decided to just be together. Cage and Presley never loved anyone except each other, but their timing was never right. Cage is now a single dad to Grace and Presley is newly divorced and has come back to take care of her dad. The spark between the two of them has never fizzled and they work through all of their problems to be together. This book is very cute. The romance is solid, and the relationship between Grace and Presley is gorgeous. This was a perfect second chance romance, grumpy/sunshine romance and ending to the nearly perfect small town series.,I absolutely loved all these books and want more! The narrators the store lines all of it was wonderfully done. I was hooked!!!,Just love this whole collection and how you in putted all the books from both story lines,,After the Storm is a second chance contemporary romance by Laura Pavlov. This is the fifth book in the Cottonwood Cove series of connected stand-alone books. I have never read one of her books before and I am wondering why it took me so long. Not having read any of the previous four books in the series did not impact my enjoyment of the couple for whom this story was written. This was a well written story about two people who had met when fifteen years old and always loved each other.  Life goals, geography, and family had gotten in the way and their decision to part had left them both heart-broken. In this novel, Presley had just filed for divorce after her famous husband was outed for getting his Assistant pregnant. Her father had just had a stroke and was going to his home in Cottonwood Cove for rehabilitation. Presley had not been back there since she and Cage had ended things, but her father needed her and she had taken a partial leave of absence/ teleworking arrangement in order to be there for him. Cage was the town Veterinarian and a grumpy single dad to Presley‚Äôs sunshine. It was inevitable that their paths would cross. The question was whether they would each have their hearts intact when their life circumstances necessitated their parting yet again. I listened to this audiobook and was drawn in by the narrators performance and their ability to communicate the emotional depth of this book. Presley and Cage were absolutely meant to be together and I loved reading a story about how two people who had always loved each other finally get out of their own way. Cage‚Äôs daughter was adorable and added a lot of humor to the story as did his extended family. I definitely recommend this book for readers of contemporary romance. It is a must read/listen. I am voluntarily submitting this honest review after listening to an advanced complementary copy of this audiobook thanks to Valentine PR and Laura Pavlov.,,Lovely story. Both narrators were great but I love Jacob Morgan reading anything! Highly recommended.,The queen of small town does it again! Just as she has with the rest of the Cottonwood Cove series, Laura Pavlov delivered a delicious, sweet & spicy small town story.,,To finish off the Cottonwood Cove series, After the Storm, was the story of the eldest Reynolds sibling, Cage, and his loved and lost gal, Presley. This was filled with all of the tension and longing that a meant-to-be, second chance romance should have. Also throw in that Cage is a swoon-worthy, single dad to his heart of gold, wiser than her years daughter, Gracie, and you‚Äôve got the formula for a perfect finale to an epic, small town series.,,The audio performances by Emma Wilder & Jacob Morgan were excellent. They executed the story with so much love and emotion, you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre watching it play out in a movie.,,Thank you so much for Laura Pavlov & Valentine PR for allowing me to review this ARC/ALC.,,""After the Storm"" by Laura Pavlov is a captivating conclusion to the Cottonwood Cove Series.

Gracie is just the sweetest little girl and I would love to read a book about her when she grows up.,Laura Pavlov is the the queen of small town romance, she knows how to weave a story and mix it perfectly with steam and laughter.,I highly recommend this book and this whole series.,Finally, Cage‚Äôs story and it was fabulous. I love the grumpy man with a heart of gold type of character and since the beginning of this series, I have wanted Cage to get his HEA. Throw in Presley, their banter and snark, they obvious love and affection, even when they were upset with each other, and this was a story I could stop listening to. The family dynamics just added to the fun (as always) and this family will continue to live in my mind as one of my favorite fictional families that I wish could come to life. What a wonderful story only elevated by the narration by Emma Wilder and Jacob Morgan (I mean, can you get a better cast?) A great way to spend a few hours, and a guaranteed smile!,God I love their story and his family üíû I especially loved Gracie ü´∂üèΩ she stole every scene she was in üíû the best ü§é I‚Äôm hoping for more ‚ú® I definitely loved listening to Jacob and Emma who did a brilliant job bringing this story to life ‚ú®ü´∂üèΩ‚ú®ü´∂üèΩ‚ú®,I have been waiting for Cage‚Äôs story and it did not disappoint.

I was hesitant about it because it was a second chance romance and I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of that trope but I shouldn‚Äôt have worried Laura did a great job. The performances were great even though poor Emma was sick for parts of it. Over all this was a great end to of a series"
24 Bad Things,"Holidays,Crime Thrillers,Psychological",Literature & Fiction,"I totally enjoyed this book! It was a perfect holiday crime spree.Grant Love was a terrific narrator,though I had to slow down the timing so I could catch everything. I was given this book free for an honest review.,I found 24 Bad Things to be rather engaging and intriguing. The novella might be short, but it does pack a punch with suspense, intrigue, mystery, and a few giggles here and there. I should fair warn you there are a few triggers in the story such as drug abuse, prostitution, and graphic murder scenes. I rather enjoyed how everything seemed random, but all came together in a neat little package. I won't give any spoilers, but I do highly recommend the book.,I received this book at my request. this is my honest, unbiased review that I am leaving here voluntarily.,Though I enjoyed this story, I  figured out the perpetrators rather early on.  Good well written story and I liked the Police officers additude towards the prostitutes.  On a Very cold winter day, bring them hot drinks and food!,The Narrator is great and I just love the accent.  He does the various characters voices and the entire storyline very well.,What a great Christmas thriller, completely engaging and so different. Just loved it.,Someone hates Christmas and the fun is understanding why and comes with a bang, such a great ending.,,Loved the narration so suited it, just listened to the book in one sitting it kept me captivated."

I wish MCP would narrate more full length novels.,,When you put all the books together thay are better then pain gravy!! thanks to all who worked on this story.,Perfect blend of comedy and suspense. I really hope the author writes mor stories set in this universe, would love a spencer or Jerry spin off.,I loved everything about it. Jack and Mr. Creepy pasta never fail to deliver. 10/10.,The ending was exactly what I knew it would be and there wasn‚Äôt enough Jerry! I also didn‚Äôt care for the political socialist crap they used as a filler. I missed the Jack and Jerry dynamic.,the best one yet man I'm going to miss these characters, hilarious and tragic and action packed.,This felt like a bs ending for jack. Confusing, convoluted and then, a poor line of final dialogue to explain everything. None of this really took place inside of the gas station.,It was a good time and a fun ride. I don't have a critical view of this installment as this series wasn't a serious read. It was a rollercoaster with highs and lows, twist and turns, and loop de loops. Now that ride is over, I can only say that I am glad I got on. I hope everyone enjoyed, or will enjoy it, as much as I did!,Great end to my favourite book series, now I just have to find something else to deal with this book hangover.,I loved how busy this was and how nonchalant the characters were about the craziness happening around them.

I hope there will be more from Jack townsend and CP in the future,Enthralling, funny and just downright strange from start to finish and I expect nothing less.,To see how this series and it‚Äôs author has gone from being essentially a creepy pasta to a full blown professionally produced and executed series is a joy to see.,There‚Äôs not much that can warm a heart in these trying times but by god Jack Townsend has done it.,Thank you to the Author, the narrator and to the shitty little gas station on the edge of town.,i loved it it was Everything I hoped for and more the jokes hit hard and i could see myself Listening to it over And over again what a good ending,This book series made me get audible and now it's over, my favourite book series will always mean something to me and I'm gonna be grateful for all the laughs and enriched storytelling.,,Thank you Jack and MrCreepyPasta.,An amazing end to one of my favourite series, performed amazingly and I just hope there‚Äôs more,Loved everything about this. From the wonderful performance to the writing. Honestly my biggest concern was that like in the previous book the jokes would not land for me. Thankfully this was a return to form that not only had me enthralled all the way through but even managed to have me rolling on the floor at times.,While I am sad it's over this was a great ending to a great series.,shame to see it come to a end brillaint narration by mcp as always,this wasn't my favourite book, it needed way more Jerry! but still a 10/10. but please do a story all about Jerry! he's the best ever,Honestly, it was a great book even greater to listen to, and I hope to hear more!

As others have said. It was better than I expected. I liked the characters and their connection. The twists and turns. Slow burn romance. It was lovely!!,I loved this book and could easily re-listen every December. I laughed out loud so many times and loved the banter - it was just my style. The time jumps usually get in my nerves but this was just right,This was a nice quick story that was perfect for the holiday season. I enjoyed the characters and the narrator was very good.,This was a thoroughly enjoyable holiday listen.  Fabulous narration.  Clever and humorous quips and banter.  Numerous laugh out loud moments.  Sweet but not too cheesy or typical.  Recommend!,A delightful story! Sweet & funny! A heartwarming holiday read. Highly recommend. Narrator did not bother me.,Super cute friends to lovers holiday story. Quite literally could not stop listening. Narration is good overall. This is a comfort read!,Sorry but it goes on and on with little outcome and character who is not terribly interesting,The narration was perfect, really drew me into the story! The split timeline was a great way to build understanding of their 10 year friendship.,A Christmas romance, so funny that it isn't irritating. üíñ Friends to lovers you know are in love, and you're just waiting for them to show it to one another. A work of festive art. üéÑ,Story was clever and adorable.  lovely Irish Christmas traditions! Narration was excellent.  loved it!,Loved everything about this book. So wonderful and such escapism. The characters were brilliantly well written and narrated well.,A great Christmas story that's really got me in the mood to snuggle up under a blanket with a hot chocolate and more Christmas stories. Molly and Andrew have spent the last 10 years on a flight home from Chicago to Ireland. They start off as Accidental meets but soon become a planned and much looked forward to event. This year is a bit different as a snow storm means their usual journey ends up being a whole lot tricker. I loved following them on the journey home and how they slowly went from being friends to more. My favourite bit was when they finally got home and spend time with each others familys they slid into each others lives seamlessly. I really enjoy Catherine Walsh's writing every time i read one of her books it makes me want to go to Ireland so badly. A really enjoyable festive read. I enjoyed the narration  but I did find the narrators accent a bit hard to decipher at times but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the story,Catherine Walsh is a new author for me but after reading this funny and most excellent book I‚Äôll definitely read more of her books. I laughed out loud a lot especially with Zoe. A great Christmas story.,The people in this book continually communicate with each other and use their words to explain where their head is at. Amazing.,If you like Moyes and McFarlane the. This is a must. Can‚Äôt wait to read more of Catherine Walsh. I love Christmas being set over the festive season was a bonus,A slow love story, told in modern day with poignant flashbacks. The pace is definitely more sedate than others by this author, but it helps show just how this relationship has grown slowly over time. I can imagine this being made into a Christmas movie, and I hope it is!,The whole way through this book I just felt anxious as if I was stuck in transit with the main characters. There were some bright spots, an escapade in London for example, but it really just felt like a chore getting through this book.  I won‚Äôt be buying Catherine Walsh‚Äôs other books.,This was a lovely easy listening book. You get caught up in the characters, and can anticipate what is going to happen. It was a holiday romance book.,I mean it was fine. Well written and I enjoyed listening to it for the most part. It just didn‚Äôt seem to have any tension or much conflict at all really. Very few obstacles to overcome bar travel inconveniences. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm more of a fan of the lovers to enemies trope. The romance was just a little too easy for the characters for my taste and I lost interest part way through.,Could NOT stop listening, not only was it a gorgeous story of friendship, family & love, it was bloody funny! I laughed inappropriately in public a few too many times! The most loveable characters I‚Äôve read in a long time, but also very believable!"

A Court of Wings and Ruin,"Fantasy,Epic,Fairy Tales,Paranormal",Romance,"I contacted Recorded books Inc. and they said via email that Jennifer Ikeda decline to continue with the series. :(,I don't like the new narrator, but we may have no choice to get used to her.,I'll admit, I had a difficult time getting into this one (but loved it none-the-less). The new narration was just so different from Jennifer Ikeda -- for Feyre and Rhysand particularly. However, about a quarter of the way through, I was over it and just enjoying the story itself. Cobb did a really amazing job with the thrilling last half of the book in particular. Knowing that we have some character-focused novellas and novels coming up in the series, I know she'll do a great job with them (she nailed Cassian, Nesta, Amren, and Mor, I thought).  looking forward to more Maas books narrated by Cobb (or Ikeda should she come back to the series). The fandom should definitely not fear this one. It's a great listen!,This is by far my favorite series of all time.  I will probably re listen to the first 2 books and only read the last book.  I am SO disappointed that they changed the narrator for the last  book.  it honestly shouldn't be allowed in book series...... PLEASE RE DO THIS!!!!,After seeing these reviews, I was really scared to listen to this.  I loved the first 2 books SO MUCH!  Jennifer Ikeda ruled.  Why the switch!?  I wish she had kept going, and I don't know why they chose someone new, but honestly?   Once I got over being pissed off, it wasn't that bad!   I mean, Amanda is no Jennifer, but I think she did her best.  The characters were good.   Lucien's brothers were fantastically evil.  I just miss the overall tone of Jennifer as Feyre.  I felt like I got to know her, and now it was like a completely different person.,And since this book is over 25 hours long, how were people writing reviews THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT!?  I don't think half those people even gave the new narrator a chance.   They couldn't have had the time to listen to it.   So.  I admit, it took a while for her to find her stride, I think, but once I got past my initial shock and dismay, and I started listening to the story itself?  I was still interested, and I was still moved.,Chapter 44 - with all the high lords?  And that scene with the cliff?  Oh - and Lord Grayson scene with Elaine????   Come on.  It was good.   Admit it.   Of course, you have to listen that far.,It probably sucks to step into such a popular series, so I say job well done -- even if I wish Jennifer was still doing it....,Is there anything you would change about this book?,No, no, no!!!!!!!! This is my favored series; I was supposed to re-listen to them over and over again; now I'm  debating to ask for a refund for this one!!!!  Nothing agains THIS narathor, but these where not the voices of the personages we love; the voice  is weird and no suited for Rhysand or any of the male carachters; very very wrong choice; im just going to finish reading the paper book; the previous voice was perfect :(,,What was one of the most memorable moments of A Court of Wings and Ruin?,From the audiobook? None!!! I couldn't concentrate on the book; I kept getting frustrated with the voice; at a point I just stoped listening; I will finish the book by reading the hard copy; which btw is perfect,How did the narrator detract from the book?,It was horrible; nothing agains her, but it was very wrong for this series; a bad choice; the most I got upset because her interpretansion if Rhysand is just bad, no emotion as in previous book( btw: I have listen to 100 time:)),Did A Court of Wings and Ruin inspire you to do anything?,Very disappoint in the voice ( new narathor it's just not good for this series),Any additional comments?,Bring the old narathor , I'll even buy the book again; this was suppose to be one of those book that I could listen over and over again ; now I'll just have to make it work with the first two :( very upset,Any additional comments?,Please bring Jennifer Ikeda back and do a redo of this audiobook because Amanda Leigh Cobb just butchers it for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I love SJM's books and I feel Jennifer Ikeda does a wonderful job narrating The Court Of Thorns And Roses series. PLEASE REDO PLEASE REDO PLEASE REDO!,Not happy with the narrator change!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where's Jennifer?!?!,Love the story but unhappy about the narrator change!,Would you say that listening to this book was time well-spent? Why or why not?,NO.  There is background noise, seems like her voice is echoing, and I didn't like the idea that we started with one narrator and switched with another.,Who would you have cast as narrator instead of Amanda Leigh Cobb?,Jennifer Ikeda,I tried, I really did. I‚Äôm 2/3 of the way through the book. I‚Äôm half listening. The story is not the same, the characters are not the same, it‚Äôs ruined. Missing Jennifer Ikeda I don‚Äôt know if the writing changed or if all of it is due to the new narrator. I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted the credit and read it on kindle with Jennifer‚Äôs voice in my head. It‚Äôs really upsetting that the new narrator didn‚Äôt listen to Jennifer Ikeda and pick up on the nuances that make these characters. She completely changed the way that they act by inflicting too much too often. It‚Äôs like listening to my bonus daughter watching Barbie but with shitty sex scenes.,I love this series. I bought every book on ebook, hardcover, and audio version. But I feel almost betrayed by recorded books that they changed the narrator for the last book in the series that is written from Feyre's POV!!!!!!!!   Jennifer Ikeda was amazing and brought this story to life. This narrator is not great. She is better for cheesy novels. Overly dramatic, bad acting. All of the intimate scenes were no longer sexy, but corny dime store romance novel-esque in the voice of Amanda Leigh Cobb. The least she could have done was listen to the previous 2 books and tried to mimic the previous narrator. It feels like my favorite TV show recast the main character. This decision ruined this series in audio version for me.,Why would you bring in a new narrator for the final book of this series after all the characters and the rhythm are established? The jolt is harsh.  Jennifer Ikeda is fabulous and I am entirely disappointed with the change. Poor decision.,The thing I love about the audio books is how invested you get in the voices, emotive ways they speak etc. To change the voice in the final book... it caused me to loose all dedication to the characters. I tried but couldn't finish. I now won't buy one if the voice changed during any series. bad move :(,I‚Äôm so not impressed. I‚Äôm a few seconds in and I already don‚Äôt want to listen.,,Makes no sense. Poor form. I‚Äôd be seriously annoyed if I‚Äôd payed full price for this,The only thing that saved this book from getting one star was the final battle.,I never want to hear the following words again:,cleave,sheath,my mate,vulgar gesture,and the miss pronunciation of the words shone(shawn not shoohn) and foyer(foy-yay not Foyher),If book two grated my nerves book three had me shouting at it every time I heard 'my mate', everytime Feyre spoke, thought or gazed in awe, every damn time she compared Rhysand to Tamlyn, at every vulgar gesture, at every snide petty shitty inappropriate comment the author thought was funny.,Spoiler alert: they weren't.,I just don't understand how this long-ass, wordy, ridiculous book wasn't edited to within an inch of it's life? Half the descriptions weren't needed, there was SO MUCH repetition and the sex scenes were...I can't even. I'm so glad it's over.,I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually wouldn't mind reading Nesta and Cassians story. It must be some kind of Stockholm syndrome for books I'm suffering from. Send help...,i was so used to jennifer in the previous book and dreaded a different narrator but i was suprised how easy i enjoyed the narration. narration and story 5stars. love the world characters the story. i wish the books never ended dam you sarah haha,I was really worried that the change of narrator after the second book would be really difficult to get used to and ruin the story, but I didn't find it a problem at all. Mainly down to the narrator's skill I suspect, as I felt the intonation she used throughout echoed the narration of the first two books, which helped massively. It felt like a pretty seamless change to me.,I've really enjoyed many audiobooks from this author but this trilogy as become incresingly frustrating by padding it out with constant sex scenes. Now I don't mind the occasional one but with every book it's become more & more until I got to the point where it seems it's all the main characters do, (even before & after horrendous battles), that it's become irritating, spoilt the story with lazy, repetitive writing that had me fast forwarding through it. Sad that such a good authour & story was ultimately spoilt by this. I'd rather it was 2hrs shorter & left out 90% of those scenes so I could enjoy the story.,I'd also say it's therefore not suitable for younger readers.,Really great third book and it has left me wanting  more stories of Feyra and Rhysand.,Spoilers ahead!,The switch of main characters for me just really ruined the whole series for me. About half way through the book Feyre starts being less likelable and we‚Äôre meant to start liking Nesta? I can‚Äôt stand Nesta‚Äôs character and reading the book became a chore. There was no plot or romance and it was mostly boring. I loved the first and second books with all my heart and had to DNF this one at 40%. Really really disliked this.,SJM looks to have lost stamina in writing this book. The other two started strong but this book is full of terrible filler dialogue that meanders and you lose interest in between plot progression chapters. All of this would‚Äôve been tolerable if a there was a half decent narrator.,She intonates incorrectly most of the time, losing the meaning of what the characters are saying. All characters sounds exactly the same so you often have no idea who is talking. She makes everyone sound like a moody teenager with her added ‚Äúumms‚Äù and ‚Äúahhs‚Äù. She really spoiled the book.,I listened to the first two books one after the other and was so excited to dive into the last one until I started playing it and realised IT WAS A DIFFERENT NARRATOR! I got so used to listening to the characters in the previous narrator‚Äôs voice that it really threw me off trying to listen to the final book in a completely different voice!,Reader let the story down. Irritating at times. I won‚Äôt buy a book with the same reader again.,Nowhere near as good as the last book, although the narration may have had something to do with it, the narration was just terrible! She got the emotions all wrong. Really hope they get someone else to narrate the story, as this narrator left me feeling nothing at all except irritation.,Story is epic, if you liked the first two you will love the third. As for the narration, yes it‚Äôs different to the first two and that can be jarring if you listen to them back to back but after an hour or two the voices blend and fade and she‚Äôs brilliant. I‚Äôm upset to see some comments suggesting otherwise. A great listen!,Read the book first - LOVED IT, so I bought it on Audible. Looking forward to listening to it on my drive to work when I realise the characters all sound wrong. Rhysand was the most disappointing. No emotion at all! I just assumed the Narrator would be Jennifer !?! I mean why would you change Narrators through a series - right?,I found this conclusion to A Court of Thorns and Roses fairly underwhelming. It wasn't awful but I felt it under delivered. The first two books built strong and complex characters who demonstrated that humans (and fae) weren't good or bad but a messy in-between. And the most compelling part of this series was that these characters faced real danger and risked real harm. This book failed to follow through on those risks and failed to round out character arcs in a believable way, it felt as if Maas had pulled her punches. The plot also felt rushed, a lot of threads were left loose while ""angsty"" but overall unnecessary plot arcs were included despite not adding anything to the story.,As always, the books by Sarah J. Mass are thrilling. Good story, well written. I the only thing I didn't like was the narrator - some sentences were over done i thought. The narrator from the first 2 books in this series was better, it would have been great to keep her on for the final book.,Book 1 was certainly entertaining, and was keen to read what was to come next. Such a disappointment, super predictable, and once the r-rated scenes started, the thing became truly unbearable. Couldn‚Äôt finish, even the writing seemed to decline once that point hit, left me feeling annoyed, tried to skip through those LONG scenes. But the story just didn‚Äôt hold up for me anymore, such a shame.,Sure she‚Äôs a different narrator with a stronger style but she‚Äôs still excellent- I listened at 1.1 speed and got used to it quite quickly. She reads  slightly more forcefully that the previous books‚Äô narrator but she‚Äôs definitely talented. The book itself is more political that the previous one but all our fave characters and more are there ‚ú®,Like the other reviews say, don‚Äôt be put off by the change in narrator. I myself was taken aback by the change, put it at 0.8 speed for an hour or so, slowly putting it back to regular speed and you won‚Äôt even notice. As for the book, wow! I was so enthralled I can‚Äôt remember what I did this week."
"The Word of Promise Audio Bible‚ÄîNew King James Version, NKJV: Complete Bible",Bibles,Religion & Spirituality,"Would you listen to The Word of Promise Complete Audio Bible: NKJV again? Why?,This is a wonderful recording. I like the performances and the variety of voices. For example, while there is one main narrator for each book there are diff voices for dialogue and the actors for those people are consistent. The voices are well cast and performed. The music in the background rarely bothered me, but is too loud or exciting in a few spots. I find listening to the word to be a good way to 'hear' it in a new way and is a valuable experience. I also love to play it for my children:) The one main problem is the lack of a guide to the 'sections'. I found a guide to 'parts' but my players show sections. This make it impossible to select which book to listen to! I made a guide, figuring out there there is one section for each chapter starting with 2. So if you need a particular chapter, simply add that number to the book's start.,The Old Testament,Genesis         2,Exodus          52,Leviticus         92,Numbers        119,Deuteronomy   155,Joshua            189,Judges            213,Ruth               234,1 Samuel        238,2 Samuel        269,1 Kings           293,2 Kings           315,1 Chronicles    340,2 Chronicles     369,Ezra                405,Nehemiah        415,Esther             428,Job                 438,Psalms           480,Proverbs          630,Ecclesiastes    661,Song of Sol      673,Isaiah              681,Jeremiah          747,Lamentations    799,Ezekiel             804,Daniel               852,Hosea              864,Joel                 878,Amos               881,Obadiah           890,Jonah              891,Micah              895,Nahum            902,Habakkuk        905,Zephaniah        908,Haggai             911,Zechariah         913,Malachi            927,The New Testament,Matthew            931,Mark                959,Luke                975,John                999,Acts               1020,Romans          1047,1 Corinthians    1064,2 Corinthians     1080,Galatians           1093,Ephesians          1099,Philippians          1105,Colossians          1109,1 Thessalonians   1113,2 Thessalonians    1118,1 Timothy             1121,2 Timothy             1127,Titus                     1131,Philemon              1134,Hebrews               1135,James                  1148,1 Peter                 1153,2 Peter                 1158,1 John                  1161,2 John                  1166,3 John                  1167,Jude                     1168,Revelation             1169,The performances are outstanding.

For readability, I have most recently relied either upon the NIV or New Living Translations, but I was pleased with the NKJV translation.  It is accurate and easily understandable; this translation was suited perfectly for an Audio book.  The readers were outstanding, and there was just enough dramatization, music and background effects to keep the stories moving without being annoying or overly-distracting.  The sound quality was flawless.,,Now, the bad:  As other reviewers have detailed, dividing the Bible into 17 tracks is puzzling.  Finding any particular passage is laborious and frustrating.,,If you are seeking an Audio presentation of the Bible to listen to and experience a cover-to-cover read, you will find this production very much to your liking.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for an Audio Bible to add to your library to listen to various individual scriptures, this format is not well suited for such an endeavor; other audio renditions may be more navigable for such a purpose.,This version of the Bible is the best audio version I have ever heard hands down.  This one is treated, almost, like a normal book, but with small (tasteful) sound effects and music.  Other versions I have heard either have a terrible narrator or the sound effects and music is so triumphal and overdone it drowns out the Bible it self.  Michael York does a fantastic job as the primary narrator.   The only gripe is that it is hard to navigate.  The books not separated, some seem to be split down the middle and then other books are bundled together.  The math says it all about this 66 books only 17 parts.  66 books 66 parts would be easier for a book like the Bible.  A normal book split in to chapters would be ridiculous, but Bible readers want to hear a certain book not have to go hunting.  Again, just fantastic the first useable audio version of the Bible I have ever used.,Majestic!! I have for many years wanted to go through the scriptures but due to limited eyesight I had all but given up!! Michael York's reading is beyond anything I expected. The music in the background makes it so much more powerful! I listen to it as I go to sleep at night! Pour yourself a cup of tea, sit back in a comfortable chair and prepare to be transported to another place and another time. What a value for one credit!! I am a believer in audible.com! Thank you!!,I listen to this on my way to work every day, and I just completed it a couple of weeks ago. The advertisement on the cover really says it all, ""Hear the Bible come alive in dramatic audio theater."",Mind you, I have, in the past, listened to numerous audio Bibles that left me annoyed due to the overwhelming music in the background. At times, it was almost as if whoever came up with the score for those audio Bibles wanted to make the listening experience as annoying as possible with awful music that did nothing but distract from the Word. This is not true for the Word of Promise. There is music in the background, but it is very calming, and I never found it distracting.,What really sets this audio Bible apart from the others is the exceptional quality of the background sounds - not just the music, but the sounds. When people are walking, you hear the footsteps. When they are crying, you hear the sobs. When the tabernacle is being constructed, you hear the construction. When Paul is writing, you hear his pen on the paper. When someone is killed, it is almost too realistic. This is all beautifully edited and mastered to very high quality standards until you feel that you are there, in the Bible, with the characters.,As to the all-star cast, you can almost see Moses crying as he delivers his final sermon knowing that he will never be able to enter the promised land. Richard Dryfuss delivers the voice of Moses with such an exceptional perfomance that you will be crying when you get to that point. Everyone in the cast did an exceptional job at delivering the content with conviction and gravitas.,The only thing, in my opinion, that would have made this work better would have been for the version to have been the Old King James rather than the New King James. That said, I really enjoyed listening to the Bible in a way that I never have before because of this audio recording. Bravo! to the entire cast and to everyone who contributed to it. I am already listening to it, again, and I believe that this is going to be an audiobook that I will enjoy listening to for the rest of my life.,The Word of Promise is a stunning production. On the basis of the production values alone, it easily deserves five stars or even more. The acting, music, and sound effects are all superb -- often achieving ""movie quality"" as claimed -- and it sounds terrific in Audible's enhanced format. The books are broken down into meaningful chunks of files with lots of bookmarks for navigation. Of particular note, among the books I've listened to so far, are Michael York as narrator, Stacy Keach as Job, Gary Sinise as David, and Martin Jarvis as the voice of God. (Portions of the New Testament have been re-recorded with Martin Jarvis in this role, replacing the original performance by Terence Stamp. It may have simply been for consistency, but it's a welcome change; Jarvis's performance is much stronger.),,Why not five stars, then? Because of the translation. The more I hear the NKJV, the less I like it. Whatever its other merits as a study text, it doesn't lend itself well to immediate comprehension in an audio setting. While the text has been modernized to some extent, there are still many archaic sentence structures, many familiar words used in archaic (and therefore unfamiliar) senses, and many personal pronouns that lack clear referents. In narrative books and in the Psalms, it works well; likewise if you're already deeply familiar with a particular passage or book. But it's just not an ideal choice for an initial exploration of difficult or unfamiliar books. The prophets fare particularly badly in this respect, and to a lesser extent so do several of Paul's letters. I often found myself reaching for another translation to make sense of what I just heard.,,Of course, without the NKJV and the support of Thomas Nelson, the Word of Promise probably wouldn't exist at all. But it does mean you need to carefully gauge what you want out of an audio Bible and whether this particular one is a good fit.,Where does The Word of Promise Complete Audio Bible: NKJV rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,This is amazing, but NEEDS desperately a table of contents.

Download the enhanced format (64kbps/22kHz) stereo production and use a good set of earphones/earbuds and hold on!  This brings to life what it was like to be there when each book was written.  No additional wording, no additional explanations, just word-for-word NKJV bible!  I am through to 2nd Samuel and can't wait to turn it on again and continue reading.  Use this in the off times when you can't read the Book, like in the car, around the house, at lunch time.  You will enjoy this.  Keep on reading!,If you want to sit down and just listen, this is great - it's a well dramatised reading of the Bible, and can be quite engaging. If you are wanting to listen to something specific then this is an absolute disaster unfortunately.,The thing that Audible has not managed to get it's head around is that the Bible is not a book that is read from start to finish linearly. It is a book where specific parts are often read and studied.,With a paper bible, it's easy to look up a particular verse or book and read it. With the audio book it is nigh on impossible.,There are 17 parts, and each part has many many chapters, but they are not broken down in any way shape or form in the same way as the bible did. Also there is no announcement of which section of a book is being read. You get an announcement at the start of each book 'The book of Mark' for example, but then it is read straight through.,So if you want to listen to a particular book of the bible, good luck - you may find it. If you want to listen to a particular verse or section of a book, give up now.,Audible - please please can you do something to name the chapters so at least we can see where we are in the reading?,For the money, and for the benefit, nothing can beat this superb rendition. Brits nervous of the sound of American voices are soothed by Michael York's melifluous tones as the Narrator, and Malcolm McDowell as God the Father - reassuring once again that God is an Englishman ;-). It is also a joy to hear familiar American stars with their rich and varied timbres.,Readers jaded or defeated by the printed page have the words of life reinvigorated. Long-held goals to read end-to-end can now be achieved and a full perspective on the span and comprehensiveness of scripture is gained.,I agree that the addition of a referenced search facility would be wonderful, but the characterisations and humanity of the voices more than compensate for this. God's Word was mediated by human vessels and this feature of the Bible - its particular authenticity - is drawn out for those who have ears to hear.,I bought ‚ÄúThe Word of Promise‚Äù as I thought it would be good to listen to in the car as I drive back and forth to work.   Sadly I have found it a little difficult to move around to different parts \ books of the Bible.  I felt it missed out big chunks ‚Ä¶ like when Moses was born and put into the Nile ‚Ä¶. There is no mention of this.  I wanted to hear that as we are doing a study on it and it would have been good to have heard it a few times before the study, but it just did not seem to be included.  It did mean that I tried to go back and see if I missed it, which is why I say its not easy to move around like you could with a Bible in your hands.  I liked the sound effects and want to listen to more of it.,I loved the download version so much I went out and bought the CD's just to make sure I have hard copies as well as the MP3.,,The dramatised versions brings the Bible alive and makes its very exciting.,,I am very satisified with Audible so far and look forward to purchasing more material,i have put this on my kindle and it's amazing! well done audible.,Anybody who always wished they had read the bible, but can never find time, can now listen on their drive to work, or whenever is convenient. Seeing the whole book, rather than the edited highlights presented at bible class or in church, really opens the work up to self study.,,The quality of this audiobook, together with special effects and music really brings home the absurdity of this work. The perceived authority given to scripture in its written form is stripped away when presented in such a familiar way, and this should be applauded.,,My only real criticism is that the indexing should have been more bible based, allowing readers to search using biblical references. Otherwise, excellent.,Where does The Word of Promise Complete Audio Bible: NKJV rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,I've always been interested in the Bible but, despite having had many, never read it before.,It's excellent value - 98 hours of audio for 1 credit!,What was most disappointing about Thomas Nelson, Inc.‚Äôs story?,I know it's sacrilegious to say it, but it really could be condensed quite a bit.  Yes, I know it is unabridged...,Which scene did you most enjoy?,It's good to hear all the familiar stories!,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,You're kidding, right?  98 hours in one sitting?  It's taken a couple of months at 2 hours per working day.,Any additional comments?,I would never have read the paper version, this worked for me.,It's the Bible, performed by an excellent cast with a heavy atmosphere. What more could you want.,Superb rendition. Great balance of dramatic interpretation without compromising the purity of the text.,Close your eyes,relax and listen to the deep wisdom of this book in superb audio quality.,It's really hard to write a review about the bible, because...well...it's the bible!,But what I can say is that I can't recommend The Word of Promise highly enough.  The sound effects used throughout the readings really helped to add to the entertainment aspect of the books.  But what I was most impressed with, and surprised by, was the way the actors expressed their characters.  They brought things to life to the extent that I actually understood things better than I ever have before. I think it's because the bible doesn't say things like:  ""Jesus was furious and said"", and because of that I often find my own reading of the bible to be flat and have to really concentrate really hard to figure things out sometimes.  But the performance of the actors revealed things to me that blew my mind.,There was one part, I can't remember which book (which is my only problem with the audio version, was that it was virtually impossible to navigate because it's so huge!!) where God was really, really furious with the Israelites and honestly, I was a bit afraid, especially because I'm a believer.  I mean, when I'd read that part in the bible myself, I knew God was mad, but I didn't realise 'how' mad He was until listening to this.  It was a far different experience to listening to a fiction novel being read, it's really hard to explain.,But anyway, despite my moment of knee shaking fear, I enjoyed every moment of it and will probably start again at the beginning, but more slowly so I can see what else is made clear to me.  I just really enjoyed hearing God's word being spoken so clearly, and being brought to life so well that I couldn't stop listening,And look, to be truthful, in my opinion there will never be another actor who can play Jesus as well as Jim Calviezel.  I mean, I see Jim Calviezel and  I feel like I'm looking at Jesus, so to hear him speaking,  this time in English and not Aramaic (although I loved hearing Aramaic in the Passion).... Well, it was just amazing.  I think I even started crying.,Last but not least was the sheer value of the book!  17 audio books for 1 credit.  I think it took me three months to listen to it all.  So yeah, if you are a believer (and if you aren't I still hope you get this book and become one!)  get this book with your next credit.  You won't regret it.  Every actor was amazing and the Psalms!  Oh and the actor who played God!  OH my, yeah, just get it!  You won't regret it.,,this audio bubble used to have named chapters. What happened? It's extremely difficult to navigate to the desired chapter and book without the named chapters. I would really appreciate it if the chapters were named again,Would you consider the audio edition of The Word of Promise Complete Audio Bible: NKJV to be better than the print version?,Yes, because it is easy to listen to the chapters you might other wise find hard to read and comprehend due to context it is written in.,What does the narrators bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you had only read the book?,The background music and songs bring ambience to the reading,Any additional comments?,It is really hard to look up a specific chapter or book to listen to, because of the fact that many chapters and books are contained within one part of the the audio. Some proper scriptural index or order might make it more valuable.,i purchased that Audio Book thinking all Chapters had Titles but I'm Very disappointed as i don't even know which Chapter of the Bible I'm i listening to or if i want to Skip Chapters it gets worse . Why is there no Titles to the Chapters ? Fix it , please as i Paid for that .,,Great way to read the bible. Probably the best audible performance I've seen as well,there are alot of places that I increased the play speed as some of the reading was too slow for me.,but that was the only negative I had,,Easy way of reading the whole Bible - just listen while you are getting up doing dishes and in the car travelling. üòä,I really want to use this to listen to the bible, whatever passage I am studying at the time, but starting at chapter one in Genesis and going all the way to chapter 1000+ without any actual biblical book names is insane.  Such a shame with such a fabulous cast, to waste this resource  which could have been SO much better,This is a timeless work for all generations. The quality of production, the pronunciation, the voice acting are all brilliant, clear and well weighted.  The score and music is well suited and poignant. This is every human‚Äôs companion toward God and an invaluable help for all who recognise that we were created with purpose.,I really enjoyed this, they try bring background noises and drama to bring it alive. Sometimes it will be the writer pouring a drink, or trumpets blowing as in revelation.,its NKJV I believe which attracted me to it.,Any audio bible will be great, and I really am enjoying this one"
He Who Fights with Monsters 10,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"TLDR; has little substance and spends so much time recapping Jason‚Äôs time on earth that this books arch is incomplete and we‚Äôre left waiting on the next book. Actual run time should have been 8 hours if all the recap was cut. Yes it‚Äôs that repetitive.,Spoilers!,Credit where credit is due!,I chuckled many times it has a quirky humor that is fun and brings the characters and story to life.,The rest is basically trash‚Ä¶.,I‚Äôm sick of the series having turned into some kind of mental health struggle for Jason, and a rehash of his old exploits. Jason used to go on new adventures and the story felt a sense of progression in each book. Now instead of having new adventures they just talk a lot about old adventures for the first 3/4 of the book and then finally something big happens, but in this case the story didn‚Äôt even get finished I was so upset after such a long run time and so much time wasted that the story didn‚Äôt even reach a conclusion to its own climax. Wtf?!,Jason gives up the ability to resurrect, forever..? That was kind of his thing‚Ä¶,This series has really taken a sharp decline after Jason got back from Earth, it just keeps coming back to how tough of a time he had on Earth and how everyone should be nice and respect Jason because he‚Äôs some kind of super hero god in the making.,The unforgivable part to me is that the book didn‚Äôt finish the story is started to tell at the beginning of this book and the substantive part of the book is maybe 4-5 hours if you cut out all the recapping bs and the ego stroking of Jason, which I don‚Äôt even mind everyone constantly doing, but not at the cost of having an incomplete book.,In the same way that Rufus mentioning his family runs a school I would drink every time someone brings up how much Jason has been through, except there isn‚Äôt enough alcohol in the world for that. We get it he had a tough time do we need to keep hearing about it for 3 books straight?! Get over it Jason; life‚Äôs tough get a helmet.,I really hope this series can find its way back to something that I really enjoy instead of just barely tolerate because I‚Äôm so invested at this point. I‚Äôm surprised to not see more people feeling this way and all the glowing positive reviews, which began appearing within just a few hours of release, suspiciously fast, almost like it wasn‚Äôt enough time to actually listen to the audiobook.,The narrator, you‚Äôre 10 books in how are you still muddying the voices and sometimes using the wrong one of the wrong character, it‚Äôs strange how these kind of mistakes are made and make it into the final cut. The voices of new characters are surprisingly good, but there are times when the team is talking and it gets hard to track who is who anymore based on the voices, which again, after 10 books is pretty disappointing.,Thank you if you made it this far into my review, I really was in love with this series and I have been in denial for the past couple books about how much I‚Äôve started to be annoyed by the recapping and mental health issues of Jason, I could understand if you turned the arch a of book toward that but it‚Äôs just not fun anymore, get back to awesome kick ass adventures and struggles of life and death. Not whatever has been happening for the past 3 books.,By far the worst book in the entire series.  nothing actually happened in the story progression until the last 6 hours. Really? most of the book was banter and I like banter but 18 hours worth is complete crap. Some important things happen in the first 18 hours but you could fit all of that into 1 hour. Thus book could have used an actual editor.,This is not great the direction with repeating plot points  makes this  awful and the editing is just piss poor. -Was a good series but it's mediocre now.,Pretty much nothing has happened at all. Disappointing to see authors try and fall short at delivering what made the story and characters interesting in the first place.,Endless ranting disguised as development, and about as much action as watching paint dry. If the author doesn't get back to the story's beginnings and roots, then I'll overcome the sunk cost fallacy and not look back.,Ever since the 7th or 8th book there's been an issue where the first half of every chapter is a recap of the last chapter. I get that it started on Royal Road and was self published and released, but for the audio versions he should have someone else tighten up all of this recap.,The amount of times the dialogue repeats itself in just slightly different ways is extremely nauseating. Then you have Situations where one character explains to another an event that they themselves already know about. So it's not for them it's for the audience. But we're in book 10 have a little faith in us. Unfortunately, I've seen this very heavily in the last few books, And for me all it does is make it extremely boring and different to listen to. As an experiment I started skipping chapters, With how bad it is I didn't miss anything. And I went back to make sure that I didn't as well. And you can't say it's because it's a teen book because there's so many That are this long and don't do this. I loved this book series in the start, I want to keep loving it.  But as it stands, these just aren't fun to read slash listen to anymore.,Monologues and endless conversations about how mysterious, great, unique, womanising Jason is. Struggled through 60 chapters and just gave up. Series is becoming worse and worse per book,These books have turned into long monologues from Jason about himself and his dealings with more powerful beings and his resolve to resist them. And also all the side characters talking about Jason. In the first 19 chapters it‚Äôs just various characters talking about Jason. The last 2 books have followed this trend and the series has lost its momentum. I am on the fence about getting the next book due to the repetitious cadence they have taken. If you removed the bullshit repetitious monologues the book would be 6 hours of total listening time.,The man who 4 years ago couldn't even work up the will and courage to confront his family has now conquered space, time, magic, and God's. Through 5 years of back and forth in this world he has conquered more than 50 generations of the greatest Adventuring families have ever been able to. Jason is Space Jesus imposing will and final voice of all, this book was written by a whack neckbeard who wants to see himself as the main character and crafts any and all plot armors to achieve that.,The last 3 books in the series has too much conversation and not enough action.  Jason has not ranked up and the meetings and social criticism overpower the litrpg aspect of the book way, way too much.  I‚Äôm tried of being lectured on social views and I‚Äôm not sure if I follow this series anymore.,well it's not all about Jason's therapy now which is a bonus after the last few books but now it's just endless conversation and no action leaves us with a book that hasn't progressed the story much at all and is for me the last one I will buy.,so this is an odd book, i think its in line with the previous books in terms of themes and feels, but I will say that unless your the kind of person that just likes to watch characters move about in a world like fish in an aquarium this book is not for you. id say about half of this books run time could have been removed and the plot would be fine, their isn't much progression in any regard, the characters don't really change much and the plot gets about half way towards progressing and all of that happens in the last third, almost nothing happens in the first 2/3s of the book. most of the book is characters just talking, and most of that is them just talking about themselves like you would to a therapist. personally i really love this world and the characters from the previous books so i am content to just sit with them talking in the back ground like a weird fantasy pod cast, but if you want real progress and substance you won't find that in this instalment.,Poor poor book, writing of the most farcical depth of actual story, close to impossible to actual follow the arc of the lead characters. Pointless this so just a waffling novella without connection to the progression of lead characters.,I love this series. The world, the characters, the banter, I love it all. I love exposition, dialogue, character development, and slow burns. I don't love the direction it's been taking the last several books. I got hooked on this series because the banter and action was top notch to me. I know not everything needs to be fast paced, high octane, Michael Bay explosion ever two seconds, but the tonal shift is slowly killing it for me.,For the past I don't know books, everything has grinded to a extreme halt. I still enjoy the books, don't get me wrong, but the sense of adventure and wonder just isn't there anymore. Now it's all politics and set up, with almost nothing else. Having Jason explore his emotions on a more spiritual sense and taking a journey of self healing and discovery is pivotal, I agree with that. Having it take up 90% of the past 3-4 books? You're loosing me here boss. It's almost like they're not sure how they want to end the story, so they just keep dragging it out as much as possible.,Go back to the earlier formula a bit, less exposition more action. Show, don't tell. Is it too much to ask for? These past books have barely progressed anything, it's like a side quest for the main plot but it never ends. I'd rather have an ending that is a bit unsatisfying or underwhelming than to have the book keep being milked like it's a shonen anime going on season 28.,The first part is just repeating mono- and dialogue. So much tiresome banter and exhausting side-characters. Then, suddenly it's back to book 3 quality adventuring. Please let the next book keep building on that and not the ""I'm Jason Asano, Clive's wife, Rufus family runs a school""-jokes. We all get it by now. Move on.,so I'll enjoyed this book can't wait for book 11 to come out next year and hopefully complete this whole thing with the soul Forge,Great listen. Of course I would have liked a bit more progress, however the humour and characters development takes time. Can‚Äôt waut for the next installment,the end of the earth arc felt like a breath of fresh air and this finally takes us back to the atmosphere of the first three books just with a much more mature version of Jason... and yes I realise that trying to use the word mature and Jason in the same sentence is folly but go with me here...,I would advise anybody that was flagging with books 6 and 7 to stick it out cause 8,9 and 10 are all markedly better.,Pace of this series has crawled. very little happened in this book and the story has hardly progressed. Feels very much a filler and I worry Shirtaloon is running out of ideas. We'll go again with the next one but if it doesn't improve I'm done.,Can not wait for the next book in the series. I hope it won‚Äôt take too long ü§û,I feel that the book wasn't wrapped up. the story continues. it feels as though the ending wasn't wrapping up events, and not much really happened in this one. Stoll loved it, but left disappointed that I have to wait for the next one to conclude this part of the adventure,Again, the narrators performance was on point, but the story itself progresses at a glacial pace, details are continually repeated over and over again, it gets very frustrating, this book could have been 6 or 7 hours shorter and would have been better for it. I'll continue listening and hope it gets better but the quality of the writing has seriously declined in the last 2 books.,50% of this story is excellent. The storyline is great, characters are flushed out and you enjoy the banter and interplay between them. The other 50% of this book feels like an excerpt from the examples section of a psychology textbook. The moral self-righteousness and social grandstanding of Jason comes across as overbearing. Yes, an 'ordinary bloke' has found himself saddled with god-like powers and has some exceptionally difficult decisions to make, which in turn, have taken a toll on his mental health. Addressing these concerns are understandable. Being able to effectively skip the first 60 chapters of this book before the storyline progresses is not. From memory, team biscuits first actual fight happened around the 17hr mark into the book.,Came here for Litrpg, left with a PhD in psychology and minor in social justice.,another great story that leaves you wanting the next one immediately. looking forward to book 11, 12 and beyond! keep up the excellent work.,love everything about it the way it goes about topics and throws in random gag parts is the best I've seen,Amazing, 100% once again a amazing part to this story, the voice acting is on point again, great work to everyone,It is as always this is well written and voiced immaculately. I love this series and the sad part is I binge these to books to fast.,Fantastic series can‚Äôt wait for the next book. Wish there was a bit faster progression but hey y out can‚Äôt rush greatness . Hope this series never ends!,Again another great book. I love that there are sections that mean more to Australians ie the slang.,Great book can‚Äôt wait for 11 now.,Its Shirtaloon and Heath Miller, what can you expect. Another absolute banger of a book. A bit slower than the last, but it feels deliberate in terms of preparing us for the next book. The lead up the finale of this one was spectacular and left me on such a cliff hanger. Ten out of ten, will be listening to this one again. Can't wait for book eleven."
The Shakespeare Book,"Drama,Classics,Shakespeare,Literary History & Criticism",Literature & Fiction,"this series of synopsis‚Äôs is just a little too‚Ä¶Cliff Note-ish‚Ä¶to long endure.  There are far superior renditions of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays That are read concurrent with an explanation‚Ä¶ And at the end of which the entire play is performed without any editorializing‚Ä¶ I would suggest that to either the Shakespeare neophyte or a devoted fan just wanting to revisit the Bard.,It is a convenient and basic review of all barb ‚Äòs life output from drama, to poetry. I appreciated the author casted and compared impacts and shadows for the past centuries,I recommended this on who is interested in Shakespeare yet donot have time and commitment to go through million words of Elizabethan English.,"

It‚Äôs a Hell of a Midlife,"Fantasy,Paranormal",Romance,"I love her series‚Äôs- I own almost all of them. This one was pretty short. ‚òπÔ∏è,But still good!,Again I can‚Äôt stop laughing while listening to this series. You have to love candy and the things she says!  Unique series and one you will love all the characters!  Also never want to eat at the author‚Äôs house considering some of the things she makes up for dinner‚Äôs in this series!!,I love this series!!!  I have listened to this series 4 times:). Anxiously waiting for the next,This series is laugh out loud funny!  And the narrator totally makes this series.  Omg‚Ä¶.SO funny.  Can‚Äôt wait for book 11.,,The characters come alive. You have to get this book this book will keep you up late at night so be ready, get your tea your coffee or whatever you're going to drink because you're going to go on a ride!!!!!! this book is so good.,Amazing how I‚Äôm left wanting more! Kept me entertained and I‚Äôm so ready for the next book,Pre-Ordered book 10! Absolutely love her books, the narration is perfect! The storyline is maniacally brilliant! I am drooling for book 11! ‚ù§Ô∏è,As with the rest of the series, this book was awesome. I cannot wait for the next one to come out and that means we probably have to wait until next year. The plot was solid, comedy, romance, and adventure were  front and center. I was just too short. That means it was great.,Needed to be longer. Narrator kills it as usual. Candy really is the star of the series.,Was not long enough. Love to story though. I really wish it would have been longer"
Tower of Dawn,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure,Epic",Teen & Young Adult,"First of all, I adore this book series. Right from the beginning. Having said that: Chaol is not my favorite character by any means. He's blindly loyal, broods too much, and has made some really bad decisions...which is exactly why we needed this book. I want to go right back to where we left Aelin, but the fact is that this book tied several pieces of information together. We learned so much new information as well, and Chaol got a lot of personal redemption. He's still not my favorite character, but I really like Yrene. We got a ton of character development out of Nezrin, which was needed.,In the end, this will not be anyone's favorite book of the series, but it is a necessary part of the whole.,I wasn‚Äôt going to read this because ... well the main character is not featured! But I‚Äôm so glad I read it!!! Game changing reveals and oooohhh so many good characters to meet and root for!! Agh!!!!! Sooooo good! Can‚Äôt wait for the next book!,This book is basically a long drawn out novella. The story line was OK at best and definitely not what I would have used as the next book in the series. It's very slow going and doesn't really pick up.,First of all, Chaol is my least favorite character in the Throne of Glass series (which is one of my all time favorites) so I wasn't thrilled to get into a whole book about him.  That said, there was quite a bit revealed that will be necessary to the next book in the series.  I enjoyed the Nesryn and the Prince story line and even the Chaol and Irene story line.,This book lacked the excitement of the others.  I feel like these stories could have been part of the other books and didn't need to be so long but I'm glad I know what I know now and CANNOT wait for the next book due out in 2018.,This whole story could have been whittled down to a part in a novel that would have included the main characters of the series.  While I love these secondary characters and understand the need to develop them and add more dimension to the history of the Volge, I didn't want a whole book just dedicated to the life and times of Chaol and Nesryn... This installment in the series was missing the action present in the other adventures.,Interesting content, but endless long winded conversations... characters and interactions that were clearly just to fill up pages of the book... no real action sequences... DISAPPOINTED...,This was an almost cheesy filler novel that follows Chaol on a love/healing quest. Very little took place to further the main plot. I don't mind romance, but please, please- a little more action! Kill something or someone already! A few information bombs are dropped- but too few and too far between to save the book overall. This novel ends where it should have begun! Don't expect Dorian or Aelin!,When I first realized that this entire book was going to be about Chaol I was less than pleased. Tbh I was never invested in his character or story. I actually debated not finishing it in protest but when my child like tantrum lifted I decided to buck up and finish it. Descent story line but I feel like the unrealistic constant couple pair ups take up too much time and as much as I love alein i grew rather tired of her romantic exploits as well.  There's 2 cheesy, predictable almost identically described romances going on in this book which i found to be very boring as a reader. I'm all for a good forbidden romance but maybe just 1 per series is a good rule of thumb. This book was ok but predictable and while it contained some good material it really just felt like a filler until the finale. Classic walking dead moveüòí,the narrator was good, I am just disappointed that it only mentioned aelin at the end. And I wasn't aware that it would only be about my least favorite characters. The last book ended so well and I was super excited to see how it would continue...But then it didn't.,I was reluctant to read this as I am not a fan of its main character, but have to say it was the best one yet!,I was so looking forward to the release of this book. Unfortunately, the first 2/3 of the book dragged and felt more like a history lesson than a novel- all important and relevant information but could have been told in significantly fewer chapters saving room for some actual action and forward momentum of the storyline. A good read nonetheless but didn‚Äôt leave me on the edge of my seat as with the earlier books in the series. Hopefully the final book will return to the previous level of action and intrigue.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,Less romance and more action.,What could Sarah J. Maas have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you?,The original character had depth and colour to his personality, which was lost in this book. Unfortunately this was below par.,What didn‚Äôt you like about Elizabeth Evans‚Äôs performance?,Her delivery which is becoming very drawn out.,If you could play editor, what scene or scenes would you have cut from Tower of Dawn?,Probably about half the book. Not much happened but it took forever to come to a conclusion,Any additional comments?,I think this was more of a romance than science fantasy. Which is not to my taste. However, others might prefer it that way.,There are a few tie in pieces of info in this book that relate to the larger story arc but if you don‚Äôt want to listen to the whole thing it‚Äôs possible to get the jist of the whole story and new characters by listening to the beginning and end few minutes of each chapter, which is what I did so that I can now get the 7th book in the series and find out what has happened to AAG! Chapter 47 and 48 probably deserve listening to in full as do the last maybe 6 or so chapters.,Elizabeth Evans is one of my favourite audio narrators, and she really brings this whole series alive- and I think without these audio books I would've stopped reading this series by now.,I was worried to pick up this book as it focuses on Chaol (my personal least favourite character) and a bunch of new and side characters. I enjoyed it better than expected, but can't say I've grown fond of any of these characters despite spending 600+ pages / 20+ hours with them. The plot felt streamlined, a few important details and twists but otherwise a rather by the numbers Sarah J Maas book. All the character relations and developments were predictable, and she has so many characters that a lot of their personalities are starting to overlap and show troupes within her own books. With audio, and all the brothers and sisters with unusual fantasy names, it took a long time to learn characters names, or to even recognise who was who- I got through that mostly via context until near the end of the novel.,The best part of this book was Choals recovery process. I was worried how that would be handled, and I've heard mixed things about the representation (but mostly good things from own voices reviews that I saw browsing goodreads before I picked this up). I had one or two issues with it, but overall thought it was done well and was satisfied with how he ended up.,Overall, amazing narrator, entertaining, but nothing outstanding compared so some of Maas's other novels.,What would have made Tower of Dawn better?,If it wasn't just about Chaol. Last book left us hanging with Alein kidnapped and a lot of drama going on, to leave us with effectively a 2 year wait from that book to the book after this being published with no word of whats happening to the main character. If Chaol was still the same as the initial books then fine, but he's just become too grumpy, annoying and self pitying and 22 hours listening to that is wearing... I'm almost at the mid way point and don't know if I can be bothered going right to the end. Massive let down as other books are great,What will your next listen be?,no this, thats for sure.,Which scene did you most enjoy?,as I haven't yet listened to the end I can't comment but so far... none.,What reaction did this book spark in you? Anger, sadness, disappointment?,disappointment.,Any additional comments?,the last book didn't involve any Chaol so it makes sense this one should feature him heavily, but maybe the last book and this book should have been sliced and mixed together so there was a bit of both in each to make it more interesting.,This series is becoming so samey and repetitive. every relationship takes the exact same path. This book felt like filler, it took a whole book for a few revelations to come out and two relationships to develop between characters who are not even central to the main plot of the story?! The narrator does a pretty good job but mispronounced quite a few words that it becomes jarring. Also everything is delivered with the same 'wry' or 'cheeky' tone so after a while everything just sounds sarcastic?,Both this book and Empire of Storms could easily have been one book, told in half the time! To be honest, as hugely entertaining and well written the Throne of Glass series is, to me it seems as though the author has got carried away with her talent for descriptive writing and ended up with a series that seems to go on for far longer than it needs to. If I hadn't already got this far I might've given up sooner. Its a fantastic story with exceptionally well written characters but it does have a tendency to become tedious when certain characters (Kaol) continue to revert to irritating temper tantrums and sulking behaviours. We get it, he's brooding, did we really need nearly an entire book about it?,This story was sooooooo booooring.,SJM did not waste one original idea for this book. Mild and unremarkable new characters. Repeatable romance plot. Old characters got some grew, but not enough for me to like them or even care.,But unfortunately by the end we learn some information essential for main plot. But if I could go back in time I would just read summary and go straight to next book.,I am struggling with this series. I am over 7 hours into the book and I have only heard about Chaol and the goings on in the palace where he was sent, at the end of book 4?, to get help for his injury. I do not mind learning about what is going on with Chaol, but 7hours of it? If I hadn‚Äôt made it so far I‚Äôd possibly give up.,,The series is well written but at times it is over descriptive and has a tendency to drag on about the mundane. This is the third book in the series that I have struggled with large parts of. Pity, I like Sarah J Maas and some parts of the series have been amazing, but at this point I‚Äôd sadly have to give the series 3 stars overall.,,Edit‚Ä¶ I now only have 3 hours left of the book and I can‚Äôt wait for it to finish! The book is still only about Chaol and other sub characters. I haven‚Äôt heard any continuation from the cliffhanger we were left on in the last book and I am not sure I care anymore.  I don‚Äôt think I have ever claimed to ‚Äúhate‚Äù a book, but I am making an exception for this! It‚Äôs awful, dull and far far too long!!! I don‚Äôt understand why people have said it‚Äôs so good? üòï,,,A bit slow at the beggining but gery intresting once it reaches the middle and very crucial before the final gook in these series.,I read the first five books but this one seemed unnecessary. Took me forever to get through. Same harsh tone and repeating ""ever so beautiful"" characters as the first books but 10% of the action. Could have worked as a chapter instead of a book.,Fucken glorious. Fabulous, fantabulous, great, otherworldly, amazing, deserving, slaying. In other words, I bloody loved it.,I said I wasnt going to continue with this series... but I am SO GLAD I did! I went from not liking/being uninterested in Chaol to him being one of my favourite characters of all time. I shed so many tears through this book. The performance was simply incredible. I definitely recommend.,Sarah J Maas you are a genius, how you intertwined each characters life's is beyond me, the words flows so smoothly and the world building its outstanding and amazing how you create all these worlds and characters is fantastical, I can't wait for the finally.  Elizabeth Evans you are a legend, an unstoppable forced to be reckon with thank you to both of you.,ahhh so bloodly good. whst a wonderful book. All these suprise and wonderful character development.  i love your books Sarah j Mass. this book is brilliant I'm so glad i read/listen to it ( i was super sceptical at first),This book is so different to the others and the first time I read it, it took me a bit to get used to. The depth of Maas's characters and artistry of her storytelling got me though! This listen was a reread and I loved every minute!,I've come to the conclusion that I very much dislike Chaol, I found myself rolling my eyes alot throughout. I understand why, but this book was dragging. I'm glad the next will be about the others.,Tower of dawn was such a pleasantly surprising read! I liked the introduction of new characters and the interconnecting stories back to older books. Beautifully written and lots of heartfelt moments of overcoming darkness ü´∂,I love how Chaol seems to be a different character when viewed by anyone else except Irene. they were meant to be, his personality is most genuinely perceived from her point of view, and hers by him. i didn't really care about the ruk storyline, but I will like anything about my favourite character.,Don‚Äôt skip Tower of Dawn. This is a beautiful story, not just a gap filler.,Yes, Chaol is forever a PoS (imo) BUT this book is so important to the series and you will fall in love with Yrene and Nesyrn! True to SJMs style, this book is full of badass female main characters that make her stories so well worth reading.,I listened to this at 1.2x speed because the breaks the narrator took between each period, paragraph or chapter were way too drawn out."

Risk the Fall,Romance,LGBTQ+,"This beautiful sexy steamy love story could not happen to better characters. Riven is so strong and broken waiting to be loved by Parish. Parish is the perfect man full of romance. They both symbolize sexy and rough.,Good background on these messed up characters. We get glimpses of Parish, Riven and the horrible Rex as teenagers and how dysfunctional they all are. With the crappy parents they had they really didn‚Äôt stand a chance but‚Ä¶.goodness prevails in the end. Great secondary characters and an awesome narration round out this book! Love this author as well!"
Golden Son,"Fantasy,Adventure,Dystopian",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"PRIDE IS  JUST A SHOUT IN THE WIND,At times I thought of The Gladiator, Outlander, Dune, Game of Thrones, and several fantasy epics. The book has a lot of good sparks to it and Brown is a very smart guy. The book has about everything, space battles, sword fights and lots of politics.,EVERYTHING IS POLITICS,The first two hours are excellent and did remind me of The Gladiator. Brown humiliates his main character, in what seems beyond repair. That was followed by two hours of inner strife. Than there is a really good sword fight. The next seven hours was mostly politics and conversations. Like most fantasy epics, there is a lot of talk about this family, that family, the histories of these families and the violence they did to each other and why they hate each other. I don't mind a little inner strife or even the history on certain houses, but not seven hours of it. If you stick with this occasionally something exciting will happen, you just might have to wait several hours. The politics got confusing and I had trouble figuring out who I was suppose to be for and who were the bad guys or why I should care. After twelve hours I lost patience and moved on to another book.,HORIZONTAL DIPLOMACY,The narrator is very good, he does a great Scottish accent. He did not have a huge range of voices and at times I was confused on who was speaking.,,Where does Golden Son rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,Golden Son is among the finest audiobooks I have ever read. My reading habits tend somewhat towards classics, and I am frequently disappointed by modern fare. I took a chance on Red RIsing, and couldn't get the characters out of my head when I finished. Golden Son is a greater achievement in every way when compared to its predecessor. The plot pulls the reader frantically from set piece to set piece as Darrow struggles with failure, guilt, disillusionment, and hope. The characters, introduced well in the first novel, become organic in this novel in a way I have not experienced in a novel since reading The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.While I was reading, I briefly forgot about the world outside as I was so invested.,Who was your favorite character and why?,Roque, the warrior poet of the first novel, returns to this world in grand fashion. His continually deepening alienation with Darrow makes the reader compulsively question the state of that friendship even when reading about other characters. While the love story between Virginia and Darrow was compelling, it was practically an obligatory aspect of the novel. Roque's growth as a character was highly original. I had no idea what he would do until he acted. At the same time, I fully empathized with his situation and understood his motivations for his actions once he acted. He is a masterfully executed character.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Tim Gerard Reynolds ‚Äì was your favorite?,Ragnar was voiced wonderfully. While the character was essentially a replacement for Pax, the voice acting imbued his journey with dignity, grace, and magnificent resonance. However, each character was read well. I could not imagine simply reading a book like this. It must be experienced through audio.,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,The ending. All I will say.,Any additional comments?,This is my first review on audible.com, as this is the first time I have felt so strongly about a book that I needed to share my opinion. It is a work that takes the best of current trends from novels like The Hunger Games and adds the power and philosophical complexity more commonly found in classical literature. Pierce Brown, if you are reading this, please take your time in completing the third book. This trilogy has the potential to truly endure once it comes to the public at large's attention, but a slapped together finale could easily destroy the world you have so carefully built.,Exceeds the first in its brilliance--well worth the credit. It is books like this that create a void in their wake as I try to find something half as good (an experience that I love as I'm listening and hate as the book ends and i scrabble around for something else). I can count on one hand out of hundreds of series the times I have felt this way--and this is one of them.  Other fingers listed below.,Four other audible series I've had the same reaction to:,The Kingkiller Chronicles by Rothfuss: the Name of the Wind and the Wise Man's Fear,The Stormlight Archives by Sanderson: The way of Kings and words of radiance,Raven's Shadow novels by Anthony Ryan: Blood song/tower lord,The Outlander Series, some better than others but in the end an amazing 300 hours of listening bliss,I'm glad to add another series to my ""I really can't stand the wait"" list. Now if only someone could give me a list--like this--of books I've never read and they'd work for me as well as these!,,Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am RAVING about Red Rising to everyone I possibly can around the office. And if you haven‚Äôt picked up this series yet, you need to start at the beginning. But Golden Son is even better than the first book ‚Äì which is such an unheard of rarity and a delightful surprise that I had to review this book first. I don‚Äôt want to give away any spoilers here, and it‚Äôs hard to say much without doing so, but I can say that this series is a total genre-bender:  I‚Äôd call this ‚ÄúPost-apocalyptic-dystopian-YA-crossover-military-sci-fi-with-history-and-general-awesome-geniusness‚Äù.  All these elements shimmer here and meld together into one whip-smart saga that stays with you for months after finishing it. Needless to say January (when the third and final book in Brown‚Äôs trilogy releases) can‚Äôt get here soon enough.,If you could sum up Golden Son in three words, what would they be?,gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, action,Who was your favorite character and why?,Ragnar.  His monologue near the end.,What does Tim Gerard Reynolds bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,Reynolds is well-known, his reading is gripping and his voice exceptional.,If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?,""BRING SOME TISSUES"",Any additional comments?,It's worth the bloody damn credit.,The notion that this series remains unknown is a travesty. These are some of the best books, the best story, of any genre. The young adult classification simply means these are books for anyone. I recommend them to everyone.,The intelligent story of Red Rising continues with Golden Son, which moves off of Mars and details a painfully boring war across planets. Yes, it's difficult imagining that would be boring, but this story manages it.  Having enjoyed Red Rising, I never would have expected to reach the last hour of Golden Sun with absolute apathy in my heart for whatever was going to happen next. Not caring whether one character lives or died. Without the spine of Red Rising's war games, Golden Suns degenerates into one spat of violence after another, with every character in the galaxy hopelessly incompetent save for the story's hero--who is mind numbingly good at breaking every record ever all the time without even knowing it. Golden Son is not like its predessecor, a smart grounded scifi, but merely the story of a god crushing two-dimensional plywood cutout characters.,Save your money and remember Red Rising fondly.,I love the way this book flows and ends. My heart aches, my blood pumps, and the hair on my arms stands tall.,I found this sequel to be a bit disappointing. I'm not sure if it was the length or the lack of depth, but I just didn't connect with it nearly as much as I did with Red Rising. Also, contrary to what The Empire Strikes Back would have us believe, middle stories need an ending, too. The book should stand on its own rather than relying on the knowledge that there will be a continuation of the series, and should have some sort of conflict resolution, rather than starting an entirely new conflict in the last ten pages of the book. But what do I know? Clearly I'm not an author.,,All I can say is, I enjoyed Red Rising much more than this book, and I hope that Morning Star is a vast improvement over it.,,3 stars.,The theme of this book is ""betrayal."" Everyone is backstabbing everyone else. After the 3rd time, you'd think that it'd be over, but no. It just continues on the entire book. It becomes a game of ""Who is going to backstab Darrow now?"" You start to get numb to it by the end. Ulg. I don't want to go on to the next book because it's all so depressing.,It's a sci-fi super blockbuster. More grown up than the Hunger Games but with the same pace and Jack Reacher as the principal character instead of a teenage girl. Don't read this until you have read Red Rising as it's quite a complicated scenario already and Golden Son moves at such a pace, you'll never catch up.,The plot picks up with Darrow a couple of years after the events of Red Rising. He's doing pretty well for himself but it turns out he should have heeded the old adage about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer, so before too long, he is right back in the action which does not let up for a full 19 hours!,Yes, some of the plot twists are a bit predictable and the characters are ludicrous  but I can honestly say I've found this story absolutely irresistible, listening at almost any opportunity. It's good, clean fun and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys an all-action sci-fi fantasy story. Possibly some who don't too.,Much less derivative than the first in the series and so a more interesting story. There's a lot of signposting of the way characters are going to develop but there are one or nice surprises. Being critical, there's a lot of a) plan for a fight, b) fight doesn't go to plan, c) miraculous event happens d) rinse and repeat which began to test my patience by the end. That said, I did marathon listen to this book and I will definitely get the third in the instalment.,The narrator has eased off on the anti-British with bad guys having slightly less pronounced English accents in contrast to the humble underdogs' Irish brogue. Sadly, there's some butchering of some new accents here: the Scandinavian is painful to listen to.,The plot twists are sublime, superb, memorising. Makes you cannot and will not want to stop the story. I listened the first book in two days and this one in another two days. Now straight onto the third book.,I loved the first book, but just feel like this was a bit rushed/less immersive,I really liked the first book. In this, towards the end, I just couldn‚Äôt stomach any more suffering, so I skipped over some if it.,The first had some greater triumphs. Something that made you go ‚Äúyes!‚Äù. In this one, not so much. Also, even more politics.,i started with Red Rising on a recommendation. Complex, engaging and enormous fun. Brown, you have a reader for life.,Having found Red Rising a wonderfully written and totally gripping read, I couldn‚Äôt wait to dive straight in to the sequel and second book in the trilogy. I was not disappointed... Pierce Brown really knows how to create a character and tell a story. Brilliant storytelling. Bring on the third book,Where does Golden Son rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,As I've probably listened to thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of audiobooks in my life, that's a hard question.  I was expecting a lot from this book.  I ranked Red Rising as one of the best books I've read in a very very long time.  Having to put all the ingredients in the pot again, stir them and make the same kind of cake, or even better, is a hard ask.  I do think Pierce Brown pulls it off, but there are some reasons, which are purely a matter of taste, which meant I couldn't give it a 5.,The story is as well written, but very much darker.  I think for me if I'm going to read a lot of dark I have to have light strokes, either from humour or more happy, hopeful or at least slightly lighter notes. Maybe I'm a wimp but unalloyed bleakness just makes me shut down.  The story, particularly in the second half, became difficult for me to read.,If there's one thing I really do object to it's following a character for hours and hours and hours of book only to find a sad, shocking, gruesome end.  It just makes the whole exercise feel pointless.  Having said all this, Pierce Brown makes you care right from the get go, or he makes me care. This book is beautifully written, wonderfully narrated and is a great sequel which leaves you wanting more.,Who was your favorite character and why?,Daro has to be my favourite character.  He is everything a real, true hero needs to be.  He is a great leader, clever and resourceful with the ability to make people follow him through thick and thin, but he is flawed. He is vulnerable. He doesn't get it right all the time, but neither does he do anything petty or cruel.,Which scene did you most enjoy?,A hard one to answer without giving a spoiler.  Let's just say there's one place in the book where I thought: ""Oh finally! Finally!""  When you read it you'll know where I mean.  It's beautifully written and nicely understated.,If you made a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?,Oh that's a cynch! Break The Chains!,Any additional comments?,Just one. I want more! When can I have more?,What a book! Really enjoyed it. Look forward to Morning Star.,Narration was first class.,I have sent my kid the print versions.,I absolutely adored the first book in this series, so it is seriously baffling that this one managed to be even better. The amount of betrayals and twists in this book made my head spin!,Doesn't suck - but neither is it top shelf spec fiction. The series is YA in disguise. Did not finish due to:,1. The PROFOUND insights by the main character that are largely chringe worthy,2 . The train smash of chivraldric single combat and modern warefare that have no business being near each other.,3. The constant emotional whining by the main character.,4. The constant stupid actions by the supposedly ubermensch main character to increase drama,After two book my main takeway is the overwhelming need to shoot the main character in the face,,Pierce is an author at the very top of his game. His handle on story, dialogue and pacing rivals that of George RR Martin. Golden Son is flawless in every possible way. It really got to me... moved me... made me invest emotionally in Darrow and his quest. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates quality writing and storytelling.,Fairly cliche storyline and the market is saturated with the likes of these tales where from the suppressed classes rises a hero. In typical fashion they make friends with enemies and enemies of friends, fall in love and go through many a trial and tribulation. Just as they seem to reign it crumbles... I guess that's how marketing works  and let me tell you this despite being cliches and nothing original- it's characters are well established its an easy listen and you can tell it'll be a blockbuster when released on the big screen. By the end you'll be downloading the next instalment , despite the tack purely because you need to know if good conquers evil, if love lifts you up, if the little guy gets his day in the sun , because the narrator isn't to hard on the ears, there's nothing to watch on tv and it's simple !,,A thoroughly enjoyable follow-up to the first book - I was captivated from start to finish. Moments of laughter and horror - what it does, it does well. a bloody damn great novel.,Tim Gerard Reynolds as the narrator is perfect, and brings a lot to the story. Wonderful performance.,No words. Great continuation of the first and sets up the 3rd perfectly! Amazing and i cannot wait to continue!,I really like the overarching theme but I‚Äôm struggling to decide if I can make it through all the filler and drama to do another book.,Might sit on it a while.,I really like the concepts, and hope they can become more prominent rather than all the im dying, no I‚Äôm not tada I escaped.,Something is always happening, and there are many plot twists. Great continuation of the series,Saw this recommended multiple times on social media. I read the first book and didn't love it, but was hoping the series as a whole might be worthwhile. but I've decided that's not going to be the case. Almost every major plot development was incredibly predictable right up to the end. I'm giving up on this series.,This epic sci fi series has shocked me by how good it is!,Serious book nerds, don't be put off by the sci fi tag, or perhaps not having heard of the author.,This is a rip-roaring, nuanced, tale. The plot twists are stunning and it's full of heart and some really lovely introspection.,Surely this is going to be optioned as a film or tv series.,The narrator is also excellent - an absolute top notch voice talent who shows you how it should be done.,This is a great follow-up book to first. I think I may have liked it better as the characters are now more developed and get to know them better."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Book 2","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"We all know that the story is beautifully written but Jim Dale's work on these audios is unsurpassed!,Fantastic story but WOW the narrator! My wife and I listen to the book like we watch a  movie! Fantastic performance!,‚ÄúWhen in doubt, go to the library.‚Äù,‚Äï J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Reviewing these books again as they've come out on Audible has been a thrill. My kids are at the age where they are venturing alone now into YA classics.,What I love most about Chamber of Secrets is how this novel proved that Sorcerer's Stone was NOT just a one-off-wonder. JK Rowling actually had a plan, a progression, and an ability to grow her characters and her series. 'Sorcerer's Stone' was great for its discovery, its newness, its magic. Chamber of Secrets was great because it was the first book of JK Rowling's where I discovered that JK Rowling was the REAL magician.,This narrator is the reason why I fell in love with audiobooks 11 years ago, I'm so glad the whole series is now here.,Jim Dale can read the most boring book in the world and make it seem alive and interesting. Needless to say though, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is far from a boring book. Greatly enjoyed it from start to finish.,The book gets better every time I read it. Great story, great narration.  A classic.,We all need fantasy to turn to when reality closes in. The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Peter Pan and now Harry Potter lead the way.,Any additional comments?,This was my favorite of all the harry potters when I was 11. This reading made me feel certain of this again. Jim Dale did a mystical job and made me love how creepy this story was. Showed you the characters true colors in his changing of his voices for every character. Very funny moments throughout. BUY THIS AND EVERY HARRY POTTER BOOK.,Where does Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Book 2 rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is in a class of its own.  Jim Dale makes these books so enjoyable and even though I have read this book about three time, it was a pleasure to listen to it.,Who was your favorite character and why?,In this book my favorite character is Ron Weasley.  Ron is so brave while being so frightened that he just makes me laugh.,Have you listened to any of Jim Dale‚Äôs other performances before? How does this one compare?,I listened to Jim Dale narrate The Sorcerer's Stone and thought there is someone who really understands what it means to read Harry Potter aloud.  His voice characterizations are superb...he has picked up many of the movie characters inflections, which makes the reader think there is more than one reader.,If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?,Since this book is a film that is a difficult question...,Any additional comments?,Everyone who has the opportunity should listen to these books.

Resurrection Walk,"Police Procedurals,Crime Thrillers,Legal","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Resurrection Walk is the most recent installment in both the acclaimed Harry Bosch and The Lincoln Lawyer series of police procedurals by #1 New York Times best-selling and award-winning author, Michael Connelly. The novel features the return of Harry Bosch, Mickey Haller, and Renee Ballard, creating a thrilling reunion of Connelly's most popular characters.,It is always a day of celebration when a new Michael Connelly audiobook is released and I started listening to Resurrection Walk immediately after my pre-order became available. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The writing is exquisite, flawless and poetic, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything less from Mr. Connelly. The narration is also excellent, immersive, and engaging, elevating this already gripping story to an even higher level of immersion and authenticity.,The audiobook version of Resurrection Walk is performed by a stellar cast of actors: Peter Giles, Titus Welliver, and Christine Lakin. They have all voiced Connelly's characters before, and they do so again with skill and talent. The audiobook is a delight from start to finish, keeping the listener hooked from the first word to the last, showing us all once again that Connelly is a master of his genre.,Peter Giles, Titus Welliver, and Christine Lakin deliver outstanding performances, bringing the characters to life with emotion and authenticity. They each narrate their own chapters and also interact with each other, creating a dynamic and immersive listening experience.,Michael Connelly proves once again that he is an exceptional crime fiction author who never fails to satisfy his fans. I have listened to all of his books, both standalone novels and series, and I love them all. I also highly recommend the streaming series based on Harry Bosch and The Lincoln Lawyer, which are faithful and captivating adaptations of Connelly's work.,As a huge fan of the Bosch and Bosch Legacy TV shows, it is always an absolute pleasure and delight to hear Titus Welliver giving life to the kind and beautiful soul of Harry Bosch for these priceless audiobooks. He is perfect for this role and for me he is the only one who can play the titular detective on screen.,If you love painstakingly plotted police procedurals, dark, atmospheric, and reminiscent of LA Noire, you cannot go wrong with Michael Connelly, he never disappoints,  The plot is full of twists and turns, but I will not reveal any spoilers here. I will only reiterate the fact that Connelly's writing is impeccable and the narration is superb!,,I am a blind audiobook reviewer, so if you found this review interesting I hope you will consider leaving a helpful vote below. Most audiobooks I receive for free for review purposes. Thank you! Take care, stay safe, and don't forget, always listen with your heart.,,,The narration spoiled the book. I just assumed this book would be like Connelly‚Äôs previous. I‚Äôve probably listened to 20. I‚Äôve obviously loved them.,I broke my longtime rule of reading reviews first, thinking it was unnecessary.,The smooth flow of sentences were broken by pauses as if they were punctuated by semicolons.,If I‚Äôd only read the 2 reviews already written, I would‚Äôve known better.,Some readers may not be bothered by this, but I was falling asleep.,,I love Michael Connelly and as far as that goes, this story  is great. Connelly melds Mickey Haller, Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard skillfully into a well-blended storyline.,Whoever is narrating the part of Mickey Haller shouldn't ever narrate another Connelly novel. He sounds perpetually annoyed and, at times pauses slightly where he shouldn't.,I almost cringed every time I knew his part was approaching.,Thank you for a story line that didn‚Äôt take a unwarranted turn into the politics of today as so many of my former favorite authors are doing today. If I wanted to hear about politics I would read a book based on that.,Order because it was a Haller book but Connelly getting real old and the story never really changed. Worst narration ever I'm returning this book,Every lawyer, who has practice for any time would like to have the feeling of the resurrection walk one time in 40 years of practice I had that feeling mine came during the Covid era on a zoom hearing of all things where the indictment against my client was dismissed on my motion it was not high drama and you are the fact that it was on zoom and nobody else was present except the lawyers the judge the clerk, but still, I felt it. I‚Äôll never feel it again as I have entered into retirement it was a good run in this book, gave me some of that feeling back.,‚Ä¶ Connelly is the best author out there for police procedural. I started the audio book immediately upon it appearing in my Audible Library and struggled to get anything done today. Thank you MC.,I insist that this is Michael Connelly's best Lincoln Lawyer storyline ever ( and I'm a longtime FAN ).,,Bosch plays a major role as an Investigator unlike in prior Lincoln Lawyer novels.  Connelly rounds out all the major characters -they've come to evolve and grow; for instance Maggie MacFierce is a pernicious character to begin with, and Connelly shows his humorous side in characters such as her. Mickey Haller's role is designed to keep us entertained and with witty dialogue and cerebral motives behind it, and in all his interactions keep the story moving along quickly. Yet, ALL the moving parts in this novel are carefully conceived. Well, I'll let you listen to Titus Willever's narration which is on point, and the other narrators ADD value to each revelation here - let you ENJOY this read now - NO spoilers here!,,,I love the Lincoln Lawyer novels but the past two books have mentioned way too much political chatter. It‚Äôs not necessary to the story!,We all know how dark and trying this world can be.  How sinister and selfish.  How ugly.,I don't say this lightly.  Hearing Connelly's stories read by these three - EACH a gifted actor, hearing the compassion in Connelly's words, amplified by the compassion in their reading - It's like a light house to me.,Connelly is my favorite author because he is grounded, meticulously researched, and honest.  He calls it like he sees it.  Each of his books is a war cry.  A challenge to the listener to get our hands dirty and make a real difference.  Everybody counts or Nobody counts.  Amen."
The Final Empire,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"You will feel like you need to pull all-nighters. Your social life will suffer. If you use audio books while at the gym, you'll reach your goal weight as you easily lose track of four hours on a treadmill. You will be tired and dependent on coffee. This was me and it was worth it.,,Enter Sanderson's Cosmere at your own risk. I regret nothing.,I started the Mistborn series because I read the Stormlight Archives by Sanderson and wanted more epic fantasy. I was a bit skeptical at first because there were so many similarities between styles and even character names between the two-book series.,The Mistborn Trilogy being a predecessor to Stormlight, I thought I might be disappointed‚Ä¶ I was wrong.,It's easy to see why Robert Jordan picked Brandon Sanderson to finish his Wheel of Time series. Although I noticed some distinct similarities in characters between Mistborn and Elantris (another great listen by Sanderson), he has so much imagination in how to make a world unique.,This story is not just another dwarves/elves/orcs story line and magic doesn't just ""exist"". There's a thought process behind where it comes from and how to use it and the dangers and consequences of doing so. I'm already about halfway through the next book in the series, The Well of Ascension, and it's fun to see how Sanderson left threads for the series to follow yet at the end of Mistborn, there didn't feel like there was anything unfinished.,One remarkable thing about this series is how well the history, politics and overall backdrop of this story is explained. Never once was I bored about learning new things about this fascinating, desolate world.,Also unique is that the protagonist of the book is a woman, and Sanderson does a great job of portraying her realistically. Even though she gains enormous power over the course of the narrative, the author does not forget her origins, and her origins continue to define how she reacts to her circumstances throughout the book. In fact, all of the characters, even the minor ones, display realistic motivations for their actions, and come across as very real.,As for Kramer-,Michael Kramer, once again, did an amazing job with the narration. I'm amazed at how he manages to create a voice, tone, and referent emotion for each character. He really brings the characters to life and adds an immeasurable depth the story. He is an incredible performer and his narration here is ‚Äústill‚Äù flawless.,For those familiar with A Game of Thrones (George R.R. Martin) and Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan), Sanderson's style fits comfortably between these two tomes. His story is not as ""gritty"" and ""real"" as Martin's series and his story is not as fantastic as Jordan's series. The idea behind the magic system is well-thought out an the characters are easy to like.,My ‚Äúonly‚Äù gripe is that I found the writing to be a bit heavy handed at times. For instance, I felt there was a lot of repetition that reminds the reader over & over again about the same character points - ex. I found myself often thinking things like ""okay okay x has had a hard life, she doesn't trust easily, alright I get it I get it."" It's consequently very easy to read & follow; I think I'd just prefer a style that's a bit more subtle. I think this issue also led me to dislike one of the main characters (Vin) more than I otherwise would have - I found myself more often feeling impatient rather than sympathizing with her when hearing narration about her doubts, fears, etc.,,I just finished the third audio book in the ""Mistborn"" trilogy and wanted to write my review starting with th first to let anyone know who is wondering whether to invest their time in another series to absolutly read this one. This story is epic. Brandon Sanderson writes a classic and was clearly the right pick to finish Jordon's WOT series.,The narration by Michael Kramer is award worthy. He not only gives a distinct and believable voice to each character, he brings them to life.,10 stars,I knew little of Brandon Sanderson when it was announced that he was selected to finish the Wheel of Time series after the death of Robert Jordan. I decided to check out some of his work to get a feel for his writing before his first Wheel of Time novel was published. What I discovered was that I had been missing out on one of the best Fantasy authors writing today.,Mistborn is an excellent series and I have thoroughly enjoyed every book in the series. I am a big fan of Fantasy and I was completely drawn into Sanderson's world of Allomancers and all of the interesting things they could do right from the start. Michael Kramer does an excellent job of bringing these interesting characters to life so expect this book to grab you from the start and never let go.,,The series is incredible! Sanderson‚Äòs world building and magic system is vast and intriguing. I have read this first book twice and listened to it twice now. Sanderson‚Äôs ability to leave clues of the mysteries that unfold in later books makes the story interesting even after several readings. Kramer, as narrator, is masterful (I think it is well known though, as he is an iconic narrator).,I‚Äôm sure that there are enough detailed reviews about the plot, character development, and the like. So I will keep it simple by stating that this series is my favorite of Sanderson‚Äôs (and I have blasted through the first three Stormlight Archives books twice now, and have read around a dozen of his novels outside the six books that make up the Mistborn series). I believe that any reader would enjoy the Mistborn series, even those who are not drawn to the fantasy genre. Sanderson is one of the best storytellers there is, in any genre. This series in my top three of all-time favorites. If you are an avid reader (and I would assume you are if you are taking the time to read this review), just do yourself a favor and start this literary journey ASAP.,Lastly:,If you don‚Äôt read this series, your life will be less meaningful. If you don‚Äôt read this series, you will never know true happiness as a reader. If you don‚Äôt read this series, you will become the reason that babies cry. If you don‚Äôt read this series, I will personally judge you and curse your house‚Äôs name. So, again, just do yourself a favor and read this series. You will not need to seek me out and thank me later, as I will know in my heart that you have been blessed with this story. You are welcome. Godspeed my unknown friend.,This is my first review, but I plan on reviewing every book I listen to from here out.  I tried listening to Brandon Sandersons first title, Elantris, but had a hard time getting into it.  I thought I would give Brandon another shot though since I enjoyed Michael Kramer's narration in The Eye of the World series, by Robert Jordon so much.  Mr. Kramer showed his true flare for subtle voice dialects allowing the listener to immediately know who is speaking before hearing who the author told you it was. He is a bit mono tone but never the less is one of my favorite narrators.,,This book had me from the beginning. I loved how Brandon Sanderson created a world where good has succumbed to evil forces, and you really cant tell if evil was meant to be the ruling force of the land and good was never meant to prevail.  His description of the world made me it easy to picture in my head and his battle scenes had me locked in.   I found myself driving around the block several times to finish the battles taking place.  The ending also has a shock to it that I did not expect which makes me more intrigued to read the rest of the series. I look forward to trying out his first book again when I am finished with it,,It is a great read.,,,This book has a lot going for it.,1) The world depicted is really very unique. The book depicts the second round in a fight between good vs. evil. In the first round evil had won and 1000 years have passed.,2) There are multiple Magic systems and they are all very interesting,3) Each character feels flushed out in details and many of them are very likeable,4) Lots of Drama, action and mystery,Why does he smile all the time? Because humor is all He has left. He believes that if you are always on time, it implies you never have anything better to do. He says ""I've been very confident in my immaturity."",Brandon Sanderson earns five stars with this book, as he has with three of the four books of his I have read, the other just getting four stars. Sanderson is the Fantasy Writer of this Century so far. He does not borrow from anyone else to write his fantasy, it is all out of his head. Matter of fact this goes against all the fantasy laws. Usually iron is the bane of magic, which explains why elves, fairies, etc disappeared with the coming of civilization and metals. Sanderson has made metals the magic element. All of his books that I have read so far are totally different from the norm. In Elantris, Magic is the enemy. The Way of Kings is his masterpiece so far.,Look at the ratings on this book, thousands have read it and it has an average of 4.6 stars. That alone speaks volumes.,The book is not perfect and it was written early in Sanderson's career. For instance having a Feruchemist or Keeper sure comes in a little too handy as more then once he saves the day. There is also, especially in the beginning a lot of talking and planning. Hours of planning. Still I enjoyed it, the writing was great, the character development excellent, lots of twists and turns, and even with the planning there is still lots of really cool action. Fighting with metals reminds me of a character in Erickson's Gardens of the Moon, who is able to turn up down or sideways or left to right, etc. The characters are not black and white. Sometimes you are not sure who is the bad guy and who is the good guy (I love that).,Fans of Abercrombie and Paul Hoffman will love this.,Fans of The Wheel of Time series will recognize the great narrator Kramer.,Listen to the story to see why I compare Atium to Spice.,,I liked this book- but I didn't love it. The premise and characters are interesting enough, but it just took a long time to set itself up and I kept waiting for something more to occur. I found the narrator's voice choices to be a little odd- he seemed to insert sort of growling pauses in places where I was not expecting them. But I got used to it and overall he did a good job once I was accustomed to his voice.,I suppose I wanted to just be really CRAZY about this book- many people gave it a very high review. But I just liked it all right. I will probably get the sequel at some point when nothing else I am really waiting for is available. I do want to find out what happens to the characters and see how the world progresses- but I don't feel that burning fever to download the next book right away because I can't wait!- you know what I mean?,The magic in the book has to do with Mistborn who can 'burn' different elements to enhance their natural abilities. There is an upper class and a slave class, and a criminal element who is trying to organize the slave class to revolt and overthrow an overlord who may or may not be an all-powerful God. That is a very brief summary, but gives you the gist of the larger plot.,As I said, this book was a decent listen, but not the best I've ever heard. I was interested enough to give the next one in the series a try- hopefully the pacing and plot will pick up there! A lot of first novels in a series seem weaker than later ones to me. I notice that many reviewers who loved this book are fans of the author, who finished the Wheel of Time series after Robert Jordan the original author died. I was not a big fan of that series either, so maybe that explains why my response to this book wasn't more enthusiastic.,I am writing this after having finished the entire trilogy. While this was an incredible book and stands alone just fine on its own, I wanted to reserve judgement on each book till I finished the trilogy in order to put each one into perspective. This was my first Bandon Sanderson book and I loved it. At first, it was challenging to get into the whole concept of Allomancy but I eventually did and appreciated every aspect of this masterpiece. The books moved quickly, the story is rich in its treatments of many aspects personal character, politics, government, philosophy and religion. And each character is fully developed to the point where we probably care about all of them including some of the bad ones. The world created by Brandon Sanderson and stunningly narrated by Michael Kramer is not like any one I or probably any of us could have possibly imagined. As long as this trilogy was, I am so sorry to have it finally end."

The Chronicles of Narnia Complete Audio Collection,"Anthologies & Short Stories,Epic,Short Stories",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Book 1 - Magicians Nephew - Chapter 1,Book 2 - The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe - Chapter 17,Book 3 - The Horse and His Boy - Chapter 35,Book 4 - Prince Caspian - Chapter 50,Book 5 -Voyage of the Dawn Treader - Chapter 65,Book 6 - The Silver Chair - Chapter 81,Book 7 - The Last Battle - Chapter 97,So happy to get this entire collection for 1 credit!  There are no new recordings in this set but it is a impressive gathering,of the best readings of the books in this series.  I own several of these on CD but did not have them digitally so I am very happy to now have the easy access to all of them.  Here's a rundown of who is reading which book:,,Chapter 1 / Titles Listing,,Chapter 2-16 / The Magician's Nephew¬†/ Narrated by Kenneth Branagh,,Chapter 17-34 / The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe /¬†Narrated by Michael York,,Chapter 35-49 / The Horse and His Boy¬†/ Narrated by Alex Jennings,,Chapter 50-64 / Prince Caspian¬† / Narrated by Lynn Redgrave,,Chapter 65-80 / The Voyage of the Dawn Treader /¬†Narrated by Derek Jacobi,,Chapter 81-96 / The¬† Silver Chair¬†/ Narrated by Jeremy Northam,,Chapter 97-112 /  The Last Battle/ Narrated by Patrick Stewart,,Chapter 113 / Publishers Credits,,The story, of course, is a classic. The thing worth pointing out in this review is that instead of spending 7 credits over 7 months to get each book of the series separately, one gets them all together & for only one credit. The narrators & production values are impeccable, & the chapters are all helpfully labeled with the individual book titles ahead of them as well. I was dubious of this particular collection at first, based on its unofficial-looking cover art, but I can now report that it is precisely what you‚Äôd hope it‚Äôd be: the best readings of these classic books all in one superb package.,this was the 2nd time I listened to these books,I loved every minute,and in January 2021 I look forward to listening again,To get all seven books of the chronicles of Narnia for one credit is too good to pass up! Lewis is was an excellent writer and storyteller that seems to perfectly mingle exciting adventures with deep spiritual truth. These books are all engaging enough to keep the youngest children interested, and yet have enough underlying messages to keep the oldest adults thinking. The only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is that the narrators are all different, so there is a little bit of difference pronunciation of certain words, or occasionally a slightly different voice for a certain character, but this is almost negligible because there are different main characters for most of the books, and the male narrators are very similar. Prince Caspian was the only outlier, as it was narrated by a female. Though she did a great job, in my opinion it would have been wiser to keep the narrators all consistently male for continuity. I would highly recommend this collection.,Wow! I am so glad that Audible now has this edition with all 7 books in it! I had been hoping to get all of the audiobooks and this set is just what I was hoping for! Each narrator does wonderfully with each of their own styles. Each story is so enjoyable and fun to listen to! I love the fantastical and spiritual themes these books hit. I would probably have to say that this is my favorite book series. Enjoy Narnia!,I read the Chronicles of Narnia as a kid and it was always one of my favorites. I read the series to my kids. I have no idea why they call this the Adult Box Set but everyone needs it. While all the narrators were at least very good I have to say my favorite is Patrick Stewart. How can you go wrong, 34 hours of one of the greatest stories for one credit.,ok I decided to listen to the series. As a child I never got past Lion, witch and the wardrobe. now listening to all of them I can say ehh. Louis write in a heavy concentrated imagery of Christian dogma and sexist view of the 50s. (i.e. Man is Alpha, Woman is submissive, and all animals are just Beast and are for our will). once you get past this the stories are ok. I did really enjoy the ending of the last battle.  it was well written and almost an apology to  to women and ""beast"",I read these books several years ago and enjoyed them  I think I enjoyed the Audible books even more.,Voyage of the Dawn Treader was ruined by an overly bombastic reader, who came off as condescending rather than energetic. I couldn't even finish it. His 'voice' for Reepicheep was annoyingly cartoonish. His inflections & tone for Lucy were almost as bad, deliberately making her sound as stupid as possible. Action scenes were torture to listen to. He was practically screaming, and instead of being caught up, I kept having to fast forward until he calmed down. I haven't disliked a reader so much since hearing the 'great' Roy Dotrice mangle Game of Thrones."
Shadow of Truth,"Romance,Thriller & Suspense",Literature & Fiction,"This audio book kept me on the edge of my seat!! There were so many twists and turns that I got who the bad guy was wrong multiple times!! I loved the male & female protagonists, and the kids were super awesome!  So was the sweet dog, Bandit!,Most important was how God works in our likes and the importance of forgiving. I know I will listen to this book again."
Genefather,"Adventure,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I hate it when you're excited for something, wait forever and it turns out garbage. I've been eagerly anticipating this book since it was announced and it does not disappoint. perfect mix of action and 40k craziness. I'm also a huge fan of John banks, I know many people were disappointed he did this one, but I personally view him as the voice of modern 40k. no one will ever supplant my boy Toby Longworth, but Banks is fantastic.,Do you see?!?!Do you see this Mike Brooks and Jude Reid..this is how you do a good warhammer book ffs...,Another great book by Guy Haley in what I call the Cawl series of books. This one about two of my most favorite characters in warhammer lore Cawl and Bile  both men of science and experimentation but in two entirely different fields with different ideologies finally clashing. With both hilarity and tense nerve wracking moments this book is a must read.,I had high hopes for this, and I wasn't disappointed. Cawl versus Bile, arguably the two most pompous and arrogant characters in all of 40k, got a full chapter of bickering and it was as satisfying as any of the battle scenes in the book, which were also great. Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed.,absolutely loved it, couldn't bring myself to stop. 10/10, awesome Cawl and Bile story.,Following on loosely from the Bile series and directly from Cawl- The Great Work, this story moves the 40k setting forward well, with some clever nods and tie ins to previous books. narration is spot on for all the characters, to the point they could all even be different voice actors.,,I used to despise both of these characters, but this piece painted them both in a good light by the end. Would definitely like to see more interactions by these two.,And this was a wasted opportunity - Haley is capable of more but this seems phoned in - much like most of his work when he seems to be knocking out an assignment rather than interested in a project.  Not his worst work but far from his best.   Mediocre at best.,I had been waiting literal years for these two to finally meet, and the payoff is anything but satisfying. Everything happens exactly as you'd expect without any nuance or depth that Haley is definitely capable of. Banks's lack of vocal range is also hilariously apparent when Cawl and Bile start conversing with the exact same voice. As someone who's loved both characters' up to this point, this really did not live up to expectations.,It had a great story overall. So many of my questions were answered! I feel like they should've used a group of voice actors rather than just one guy.,probably why the title is singular as it only follows that plot for one of the characters.,gives some more insight into some of the characters but does seem like setup for the next set of books for crawl and Bile series.,could have been infinite and the divine just with arrogance and self belief but it's not.,Both Bile and Crawl have bigger more interesting plans discussed in the book I kind of just wanted those books! Also bile and crawl have a few fun conversations but there‚Äôs not much depth beyond thinking the other is awesome.,I enjoyed this one a lot, an interesting plot and development, good passing, crunchy bits of new lore for fan of the universe!,Gripping and engaging with excellent narration. Easier to follow than many Warhammer novels by far,it is a really good story. A bit slow at the start, but then it goes well.,Another successful narrative tracking some of the brightest minds in the 40k universe. If you enjoyed The Great Work and The Infinite and the Divine then you should enjoy this.,Simply a brilliant book.,As good if not better than the great work.,The works of lesser men chapter had me mesmerized  as to how it would all unfold.,,just brilliant, I never write reviews but felt I had to with this one! I enjoyed it so much,Fantastic set up for upcoming books. Cawl and Bile is as good as you think.,Good stuff. Did enjoy all of it. Some nice new lore bits in it aswell.,,""Curse you Belisarius Cawl!"" -Qvo 1-89,Getting to see our favourite 40k mad scientists run a muck was sheer joy, the way Cawl's mental processes and interactions with technology are depicted had me particularly gripped.,Despite its relatively short length and occasional trouble telling the difference between Cawl and Bile's voices, I still have to give this 5 stars for how positively I think this story impacts the setting and how truly fun it was,Very cool and entertaining story with great character personality from the narrator, however neither the story nor the narration ‚Äúfeel‚Äù 40K.,Change the character and item names and it would read as a good Star Wars book.,Hot damn this was amazing, so much was packed into 10ish hours. Mechanicum politics, inquisitors, dark mechanicum, dark age tech, the emperor(maybe?), necrons and more besides! such a good book!"
A Court of Mist and Fury,"Fantasy,Literature & Fiction",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"When we last left Feyre, she freed Tamlin, his court and the whole of Prythian. But at the cost of killing two innocent fae. So the last book ended with Feyre having to deal with the aftermath of her actions and of dying and being resurrected as a High Fae.,If you come into this book curious about how Feyre is coping. Or wanting to know what was up with Rhysand stumbling during his last interaction with Feyre. Or what is up with the bargain he made with Feyre. Or what exactly began Tamlin and Rhys' enmity. Or what are the other courts like. Or what the hell Feyre's last name is.,Then your curiousity will be satisfied.,However, if you come into this book with a high investment on who Feyre ends up with, all I can say is that you will either be very elated or crushingly disappointed.,Personally, I like the book and its continuity with the first book. I like how the author handles Feyre's character development for this book. I don't really care much about who Feyre ends up with as I like both the guys introduced in the first book.,But from a shipping perspective, I can pretty much see how a reader rooting for one guy would be enraged or elated at how the romance department goes.,So just be prepared,Finally, I just want to comment that this title should not be under the Teen category. If you're a parent who has any plans on buying this for under 17 children, you might have reservations because this book has even more graphic sex scenes than the first book.,What did you love best about A Court of Mist and Fury?,,Any additional comments?,Loved the book and can't wait for the 3rd book.  However audible has this listed in the 11-13 ""teens"" category.  NO WAY is this a teen book, graphic and steamy sex scenes throughout the book.,I did enjoy the story ,characters and the voice actress even grew on me. I do believe this one should have an R, if not X rating. There are very detailed sex scenes. Offended ? No. Suprised? Yes.  Personally, as a mom, I would not suggest this book to anyone under 18. I am hoping this is marketed as young adult, meaning  18 -25.,With that all being said, I am looking forward to the final book. Hurry up Sarah!,Pros: Great storyline and interesting plot development from book one into book two.  I felt the characters, both old and new, were fleshed out well.  If you liked the first book in this series, you will love this developments in book two.,Cons: Way too many graphic sex scenes. I really could've done without those--the storyline itself was strong enough that these scenes and the use of foul language seemed to cheapen the depth of the book. The descriptions were waaaaay to long and slowed down the action of the story. I was really surprised that Sarah J. Mass would include such graphic details. Sadly, it's enough to keep me from recommending this series to others.  If I wanted a ""romance"" novel, I would buy one.,This book should not be a teen novel. Explicit sex scenes all the way through.,Our story tranforms into something more than just your typical love story. Without any true spoilers: I felt a ""Twilight"" repeat being thrown at me in the beginning.,But then our fragile human evolves into a warrior in the Night Court. I love the characters in the night court. Just how we all imagine a house full family members interacting. Fights among each other but bands together when outsiders threaten them. The dialoge is witty and cute. The mystery of the Night Court is revealed and it's not what I thought. On a personal note I wanted more time in the Court of Nightmares. There is a good story waiting there.,We learn the flaws of all the characters. Even the perfect Spring Court has secrets. The change in our new leads was done perfectly. Not too fast or too slow. The love scenes were very unexpected. The author goes into more details with the sex scenes than any of her other books.,I giggled and cried and fell in love with the true hero in this story. I can't wait for Book 3.  This sequel is better than the first book and is now one of my Top 5 of all times. However, I wouldn't suggest reading them out of order.,,This book, in simple terms, is the best YA book I have read so far. Everything about it is a journey, and all of the character development was illustrated beautifully!,Jennifer Ikeda also did a wonderful job at narrating the story with her slightly rasping voice and pitch control!,For adults it's... okay? I don't hate it. The ideas are far from original, but the setting is interesting and I like some of the characters. The romance fell flat in this book. The whole thing comes across as a lecture in how to be a feminist boyfriend.,,My main issue with this series is that it is labeled as YA and suggested for 14 year olds... despite having very graphic and at times even disgusting/raunchy sexual content.,,As an adult, I enjoy some sensuality in my romance novels, but fondeling the heroine in a vouyeristic way is not something I want to see in a YA novel. This book should be moved under paranormal romance section for adults.,good reader! Bad story.  Imagine Twilight meets Beauty and the Beast and you can just save your money.,If you could sum up A Court of Mist and Fury in three words, what would they be?,This is a good book. Decent story, good characters. Fae and humans are involved which is always fun to read about! And of course the many love triangles make it exciting to root for your favorite characters.,What could Sarah J. Maas have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you?,This book seemed a bit long winded. The main character was in her head A LOT. Always brooding over her ex or her current situation, or how she was a stupid weak human. This book tried, I believe tried very hard to bring Fayre into a ""female heroine"" role. And just when you thought yeah the brooding is over and shes turning a new page, action is happening! NOPE! Surprise, she'd go right back into wallowing. Because of this, it is hard to listen to. Like I kept finding myself wanting to hit the ""fast forward 30 sec"" button just to get through the scene and onto the next good part!,What does Jennifer Ikeda bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,She is amazing at narrating. Every voice is different, you can really tell whos speaking just by her amazing narration. And shes not to slow, or to fast. She did excellent with this story trying to bring some life into it!,If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?,""Enjoyable for all who like to sit and wait"",Any additional comments?,This is still a good read/ listen to, just not as good as others.,I really enjoyed the first book in this series. It had sat on my kindle for such a long time and when I read it I was annoyed at myself for leaving it so long. A few months later I started this book and it took me the longest time to read it. I had a lot of blog tours which I had to prioritise. In the end, I listened to the second half of this on audible.,,In the first book, I loved Tamlin. I'd seen a lot of people talk about Feyre and Rhys and I couldn't work out how she could go from Tamlin to Rhys. It just didn't seem imaginable. And then I read this book. After a few chapters, I HATED Tamlin and everything started to make sense. Tamlin pretty much ignores Feyre. He ignores how she's feeling and how she's coping after under the mountain. He can't see that she is struggling and worse still he doesn't ask or try. Tamlin does some truly unforgivable things in this book which I didn't see coming.,,Rhys on the other hand, I wasn't sure about him in book 1. He seemed like the villain but there were hints maybe things were all that they seemed. In this book, I fell and I fell hard. Rhys is nothing like the person he seemed in the first book. When you get to see the real Rhys you see that he was putting on a front. Why you ask? To protect the ones he loves and what better reason is there than that?,,Feyre changes so much over the course of this book. At the beginning, she is broken. So broken that it seems like there is no way back. But as she starts to heal she becomes someone new. She can't go back to the girl she was before under the mountain it's just not possible so she becomes someone new. I like this new Feyre. She is kick ass, she is stronger than ever before and she knows her own mind.,,I also loved the introduction to the night court and all its members. I love each of them in their own way. They all have their own stories to tell and each captured a little piece of me.,,The ending of this book broke my heart into so, so many pieces. I was so glad to have the next book because there was no way I could leave it like that.,I read this book first in three days love Sarah j Maas she's amazing writer!!! Had to listen to the book so it came alive and plus I wanted to read it again but didn't have the time so listened end lessly whilst cleaning I've fallen in love with it over again and have the most terrible book blues after this one bring on May 2017 for a court of wings and ruin!!,Honestly as good as the first, loads of twists, I had an inkling that rhysand was gonna have a big part in this book. Don‚Äôt wanna give too much away, as you need to find out for yourself! Really Love the narrator she definitely made the story for me.,I didn't think I'd have to write a review as I urgently need to get on to Book 3 immediately.  I've been having a hard time recently, I'm grieving for the loss of my best friend of 27yrs. It was her woodland burial in Belsay, Northumberland, UK., last friday and the only thing keeping me sane is being knee deep in Audible books whilst I work, garden, walk etc... I started Book 1, ACOTAR on Friday evening and its Thursday and I've just finished this second volume.  Fiona was the person who introduced me to Audible last Nov. & now I cant live without it. I'm onto my 43rd book since then.   I love this world and the characters that Sarah J Maas has created and I'm relieved there are more stories to come x,This book was a fantastic second to the series. I am just in awe of the whole thing, a few twists that I was not expecting too which is always nice when you can't predict what is going to happen next! I really really cannot wait for the next one! Rhysand and Ferya forever ‚ù§Ô∏è,love this series, have to start the next immediately, dont know dhatbim gonna do when finished them all,I really enjoyed the book, I read it on my kindle first then decided to read it again and bought the audio version. The story is really good, I like the characters and the fantasy world it is set in. The narrator on this one was pretty awful, she sounded like an American gangster a lot of the time, like a bad actor playing Al Capone, very irritating,I‚Äôm going to be so sad when this series is finished ‚òπÔ∏è I don‚Äôt really read or listen to books, and this book has changed that!,I love this series so much, the characters, the twists and the world it builds.,finished book 1  finished book 2 and I am itching for book 3 I love these I have never  wanted to read/listen to  a book in my life, i have not bid able to have a good night sleep because i am constantly wanting to read more of this series very excited to see what happens in book 3,I thought A Court of Thorns and Roses was good, but A Court of Mists and Fury OMG! Big twist to the story first up, but never looked back! Loved this book and couldn't put it down! It is going to be a long long wait until the next one!,I thought this was a much stronger book compared to A Court of Thorns and Fury. Emotionally powerful, but I thought some of the characterisation were inconsistent, especially Feyre, Lucien, Rhys and Tamlin.,I could not stand the narrator at first, her voice made Feyre sound petulant and whiny. Her voices for the characters also sounded very similar to one another. If I hadn't read this book before listening to the audiobook I would have been utterly confused.,,love the twist...it was what i was hoping for...;) the second book is better than the first but i just dont like Feyre.,It's amazing how this book kept me at the edge of my seat! Definitely better than first book! My heart kept leaping out of my chest!,I was a bit wary about reading this book because I loved the first one so much and didn't think it could be bested, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This book was so different to its predecessor but it was even more amazing. It was empowering and heartbreaking and addictive, so much more so than a Court of Thorns and Roses, which is saying a lot. And the narration just made it come alive for me. I can't wait for the next book to be released.,Part two, A Court Of Mist and Fury is even better than Book One. Presumably, there will be a Book 3 I can't wait. If not, the ending of this book is disappointing.,I liked the first ACOTAR book but it wasn‚Äôt until the end of that book that I fell in love with the stories and characters and became excited to read the rest of the series. ACOMAF is SO good. It‚Äôs my favourite book in the series, it‚Äôs romantic and exciting. It‚Äôs really great. Feyre is such a badass and I find her character inspiring and authentic. SJM has created a wonderful fantasy world thats easy to get lost in. The narration is really wonderful, Jennifer has done this book justice!,I‚Äôm obsessed by this whole series it‚Äôs so captivating and easy to imagine this world with twists and turns everywhere,The story and narration are,Most captivating and a book I can't stop listening to.,Wonderful- thank you.,I haven‚Äôt had a story spark my interest like this in such a long time. I‚Äôm so happy there are more books to go"
Inheritance,"Supernatural,Suspense,Romantic Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Another author jumping on the disappointing bandwagon. I know it's now the thing to do - instead of publishing a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end, authors have learned they can break up the book in three random places and make three times the profit. I get the appeal but from the reader's perspective, it's SUPER annoying. Stopping on a random part of the story is awful. Trilogies used to be three books that could stand alone - each having an introduction AND a conclusion -- with each story picking up where the prior one ended. Over the past few years, publishers have taken this practice a step further and just now don't even bother to try -- just randomly stopping in the middle of a story. Now if a full book is 900 pages long, publishers divide the story into three, 300 page ""stories"" and slap the word ""trilogy "" on the cover to make 3x the profit, reader appeal be damned. In this book, that division point was practically mid sentence. I find that decision to be incredibly disappointing and insulting to your readers. Books aren't cheap and I didn't purchase one episode of a sitcom here!! The story itself - the third of which they provided in this purchase - seems great but I MUST STRONGLY DISCOURAGE buying this one until the full book is published. Otherwise, you'll be  incredi,exactly. Super frustrating.,Not a way the leave the reader‚Ä¶good story line but the ending was a real disappointment.,Not a complete story. Good so far but I wish I knew there is no ending yet.   I would have waited until the complete trilogy was released.,Never liked  books that are not stand alone.Really didn,t like this ending. Usually have no issues with Nora Roberts but this is a terrible way to end a book.,I am not a fan of Nora's fantasy writing but she is the best author for stories with ghosts. this book grabbed my attention from the first paragraph.   The narrator is amazing and keeps my interest throughout the book. A wonderful story that I will listen to over and over. I cannot wait for the next book in the trilogy. I have always loved Nora's love stories but this one blows my mind.,I wish I had known this book would be a series with no ending.  I refuse to purchase books like this unless all in series are available at the time of purchase.  It could be months or longer to learn how this ends.   That being said, it is a good book with excellent narration.  So many good story line books are ruined by bad narration.  I will pay more attention in the future and be certain that an ending is in sight.,,An interesting storyline with characters who thecreader cares about. Unfortunately, leaving the reader hanging at the end was a dirty trick and so unlike Nora Roberts. (We'd have gonevtobthe next read of the series without it! ),Normally like Nora Roberts but so much time is spent on describing the interior of the ""Manor"" I got bored.  And her character is either really stupid or really gullible by ignoring all the signs of an intruder.    Just could not get to the end.,Nora Roberts don‚Äôt you have enough money. Separating the story to force people to buy more books.,Was not expecting this book from Nora Roberts. I will not be buying anymore ghost stories."
Cherish,Paranormal,Teen & Young Adult,"To start off, I really wanted to like this book. But it was hard to. I honestly  feel that  after book 3 this series kind of went downhill. It got so convoluted, confusing and repetitive. And this finale was the worst installment.,I   feel like this book and book 5( charm) could have been combined into one book. It was that repetitive. Grace complaining about how much of shit show her life has become. A little peek into side characters lives and then throw in a A sexy time with Hudson which I skipped past cause I was tired of hearing about ‚Äòhow good‚Äô he felt. And her going from gargoyle to Demi God was just so unrealistic and then  to be related to so and so was just too much.,And a lot of the side characters were underdeveloped. Like they were afterthoughts and it was annoying. I was more interested in hearing about Jackson and Flint than Grace and Hudson.,And what got super old  was the short chapters and the, trying too hard cliche chapter names.,To wrap it all up. This series ends on dud. It went on for too long and got so convoluted with all its unnecessary additions of gods, a shadow world and too many unnecessary details that just felt like fillers. And the ending was so rushed and messy as hell.  Don‚Äôt get me started on the so many loose ends ( which I‚Äôm sure were  meant to keep this series going in the spin off)that are just annoying. A  very disappointing and anti climatic finale. The only saving grace was the return of Smokey,I have read all the books and I have to say this is the most beautiful, exciting, amazing book I have read in a long while. I love this author and this book series! I highly recommend this book‚ù§Ô∏è,Loved. The growth of Hudson and Grace as a power couple spot on. Insecurities showing, fear of each others actions, fear of losing each other, the love for each other. I do miss the laugh out loud moments in the other books but all in all a great wrap up to their story. I was hoping for Hudson in an awe moment of Grace to bust out Trains ‚ÄúMarry Me‚Äù at the end of the book as the surprise but I suppose what he had to show her was enough for now if it means more books. I hope the hints of Academies, and Katmere reopening, along with hunters threat will only allow us to see more of these characters in a cross over. I need for Macy to find herself and her happiness, need the Gargoyle kids to join the academies after 1000 years, to see more human and paranormal coexistence.,Absolutely love this series!!!! Really hopes she does a 7th book!!! I'm not ready for the Grace & Hudson, Jackson & Flint, and Makhi & Lorali adventures to end!,1st person/single pov,Spice: 1/5 (don't worry it is basically fade to black),,So when I found out this book was going back to the Shadow Realm I was instantly excited. Given what we found out happened in the Shadow Realm with Hudson and Grace and who was left there I knew it was part of their story I couldn't pass up. I will say that I didn't love this particular book as much as I did the rest of the books but I did still enjoy it. It had all of the usual Grace and Hudson banter as well as the Hudson and Jaxon banter that drew me into the series, to begin with. However, it also has some tension between Jaxon and Flint that I was completely wrapped up in the entire book as well as some added tension between a couple of other side characters.,,In fact, we get to see quite a few of our favorite characters from the previous books make a repeat appearance in this part of the story. We also get to see some new characters and learn more about some of the ones we've only seen small glimpses of so far. There are a lot of laughs, a quite comical concert experience, moments of vulnerability that will have you choking back a few tears, and a story that wraps up all of these characters we've grown to love these last few years in one big happy ending. While this book did not necessarily blow me away as the ones before it did it was still an excellent way to wrap up their series and I can understand why it was written in the order it was. As for the audio well it was as good as the rest of them were. I've always loved the voices this narrator gives to all of the characters especially Hudson's. And you do get a small moment from Hudson's point of view at the end voiced by Liam Price. I'm still not a big fan of his female voices but it's always a bonus when we get a Hudson chapter regardless.,Definitely gets you hooked and want to know what happens next! Hope there are more books in series to come,amazing....I loved this series from start to finish! I wish there was more to add to it.,this book was all over the place and it didn't know what it wanted to be. when it clearly just needed to be a nice clean  Epilogue to the series. to be blunt it was just boring and extremely repetitive of everything that came before it, and it was just riding on the fact ....it was the last one. this book could've easily been cut into the other books but a call of one last book was needed for sales figures. not worth your time.,Excellent series, bring Grace and Hudson back! Please;) Continue to write more.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüíï‚ù§Ô∏è  Thank you so much.,I'm still very bothered by the difference between the first few books and the last 2 books, they pronounce Mckee's name different. I'm not sure what the actual spelling is (audio) but it drove me nuts any time someone talked about him. I loved his character in the first few books, but almost wishing he would die, so they would stop saying his name.,The ending felt like it rushed so much into the last couple of chapters (most chapters were to short) and ended abruptly. The work up to who would take over as vampire king & queen, was done in two sentences, if that.,I loved these books but I felt cheated out of a decent wrap up. I really would have loved to see more of Smokey. She was my favorite.,The story is cliche and obvious but still hard to follow. Lacking and detail and making little sense. Also found the acting really annoying!,Still I was curious enough about the story to listen all the way to the end.,Got as far as chapter 18 and could not take the appalling accents any longer (especially Hudson!) It was so bad that it was distracting so I‚Äôve given up and bought the kindle edition.,Maybe I‚Äôm bias, given I‚Äôm British, but it massively affects the overall feel of the character and just ruined it. So annoyed!!!,I wish there was more I‚Äôm sad this series has finished I would have loved to know more about the other characters or had chapters just about them in their pov"
Finding Peace in the Storm,"Catholicism,Spiritual Growth,Saints & Sainthood",Religion & Spirituality,"I'm going through major spiritual battles right now and I have a team working with me through deliverance.  a few months prior I saw the author and his son talking  about his new book and the book conformity to gods will.  I read conformity that day and was kinda crushed as I'm really going through the wringer big time especially in my health. well down the pike came more and I did a 30 day protocol with the guidance of my local catholic church to determine level of diabolical influence.  well it's been a very difficult 30 days and yesterday this book popped up again only to confirm for me that this boat  I'm in is God will.  tough pill to swallow to say the least.  However I feel a little less freaked out knowing God has a plan in my suffering and it is not for nothing and all this will work out for my good and his glory.  I just finished this audio in just a small amount of time and will listen again and again until its message helps my mind transition from fighting gods will to gladly accept his will Beit in my eyes good or bad.  not a concept for the majority of the population at all , but I have always known my path was going  to be different and trying to have one foot in the world and one foot with christ.  well , that never works and only ends in misery.   Thank you for this book and delivering Gods message to me again.  seems I didnt want to accept it the first time he sent it to me."
"Move the Body, Heal the Mind","Physical Illness & Disease,Mental Health,Psychology,Memory Improvement",Health & Wellness,"This book would be way better if the author wasn't so concerned with telling you her life story and just stuck to the science. Had to give up halfway because the narration became too annoying.,,If you ever want to exercise because you know you should but hate exercising and can‚Äôt get yourself to do it this is the book for you. I‚Äôve read lots of books about motivation and exercise. I thought I already knew the benefits of exercise but it turns out there was a lot I didn‚Äôt know. This book gives so much information in a way that makes sense and is easily understood. I loved the author‚Äôs narration and text. This book isn‚Äôt flat, boring, or so technical that it puts you to sleep. She actually feels like a friend. Upon finishing this book I immediately started it over. After way too long to admit, I am on day #3 of exercising and feel a motivation to continue for many more reasons than losing weight. This book was life changing for me. I can‚Äôt recommend it more.,I bought the book to give to my mind losing father and then decided to get the audio while waiting for the book to arrive.,I assumed the reader was an actress reading it with emotion.  Even better it's read by the author and doctor.,This book is so informative, uplifting, and motivating.  It is a must read for yourself and your whole family. She emphasizes the benefits of exercise for your own mental health which is amazing but the one huge nugget of info at the end about children,  learning, and creativity is what needs to be shouted from the rooftops in my opinion.,This book is the perfect companion for a science geek or sceptic who wants to believe it‚Äôs all worth it.,Thank you, Jennifer!,This is a book that can definitely help you find ways to be a better you. The old model of personal achievement through self-discipline works for some but many if not most struggle with this because we have so many negative influences surrounding us. Focusing on movement and how it can help us to feel better in the moment makes a huge difference in continuing this positive behavior. Thanks to Dr Heisz for providing so many examples of how this is the case.,Loved it!! It was very inspirational and motivated me to get up and get moving!! Very informative and easy to understand and put into practice. Thank you, Dr. Heisz!!,loved it - so motivating and really clear and an enjoyable listen. so helpful in shaking the lockdown languishing and getting back to health and wellness. the brain - emotion and creativity connection was fascinating.,A great combination of scientific connection of mind and body, and the personal story of that connection."
Moriarty: The Silent Order,,,"I realize I'm going against the current by saying I didn't like this very much, and I'll explain why in a moment.  I don't mean to take anything away from anyone else's pleasure, though, so feel free to ignore me.,,Moriarty is pure hocum -- a lurid plot with a lot of melodramatic touches, with some appropriately broad performances.  It's like old radio in that respect, and that kind of thing can be fun -- Orson Welles as the Shadow, for example.  But it grated on me, like the first part, which I dropped after a few minutes.  Unlike the old pulp stories, you constantly have the feeling that someone is trying to be clever.  Every minute of it reminds you that somebody's written it, and not very well.  The dialogue is so derivative, and so anachronistic, that it could have been generated by ChatGPT.,,For example, after his tumble at the Falls, Holmes has gone missing.  The bad guys have a man in a room who's lost his memory, who they've been torturing to get his memory back, as, apparently, you do in such cases.  He turns out to be Sherlock Holmes!  In case you missed it that this was supposed to be stunningly unpredictable, the music  spends a good part of a minute cuing you that it was, and giving you time to absorb it.,,But, you know, it's got Helen Mirren in it, and she sounds as if she was enjoying herself.  Nothing is without some redeeming feature.,This chapter was full of tons of twists and references, harkening back to The Adventure of the Empty House, The Adventure of the Second Stain, and The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton. It's a shame that they couldn't get the original voice actor for Colonel Moran but all in all, a terrific story I look forward to seeing continue, hopefully all the way to His Last Bow. The storytelling was gripping with more twists than I could have expected. It was a great listen.,Really love this show. Well acted and interesting take on the Sherlock lore. Rarely write reviews but this show earned it!,I just listed to the first and second performances for the first time and was simply delighted in the story and acting. I haven‚Äôt really been thrilled with a Sherlock Holmes original or interpretation before but the actor chemistry in this version thoroughly pulled me in for both editions. I very much look forward to the next season(?) and listening again to these two beforehand. What a gem!,first one was amazing so expectations were high and I did not think this was as good as the first. But for a sequel the story wasn't too bad. the production value was high but not overwhelming with sound effects; that element I actually think was done very well. overall  it is pretty good and worth listening to especially if you like Sherlock Holmes stories.,High production value but so so story and not much to follow through the chapters,The voice acting was fantastic, even better this time and the first one was already vwry well done.,The story kept rolling along with some expected and a few less expected twisrs and turns and all the while it kept moving.  I binge listened to it and found it to be an entertaining performance and I look forward to the next one.,I used to be a complete Sir Arthir Conan Doyle Sherlockian snob, hut there are quite a few great additions to the pantheon, although not considered canon, and it has been fun enjoying them,all, including this Moriarty series.,This was just awesome. I intended to listen a few times on my way to work to spread it over a week or so but binged it in one sitting. It was just so good with thoughtful plot and layers of deceit and stunning sound design and voice performance. Dominic Monaghan is obviously an accomplished film actor but his role as Moriarty is just wow. It‚Äôs also a fun reimaginatiom to paint Sherlock Holmes as a little bit of a gritty, cocky, Brit, while the good professor sounds more like the queens English, but is a mastermind of the most prolific crime. They‚Äôre both bad guys and it‚Äôs SO great. Part III please.,Such a fun listen, really enjoyed the mystery, the actors truly make the story come alive. I can not wait for the third one.,I enjoyed the first installment and was pleasantly surprised to find this one actually raised the bar. It found a way to incorporate my favorite novel from the canon, one that's often overlooked, in a very inventive way. And I think this is the first audio I've listened to with a post-credits scene. I'm already looking forward to part three!,Compete rubbish badly performed. At least it was free but wasted 5 hours of my life.,This was an enjoyable listen even though the use of American English words/expressions and a few bizarre accents got on one‚Äôs nerves.,A brilliant idea and different take on a classic Sherlock Haynes thoroughly enjoyed,Well written and excellent voice actors couldn‚Äôt stop once I started,On the whole I enjoyed this second instalment. It lost its way in the latter third but an entertaining listen nonetheless.,This sequel to Moriarty can be listened to in a day while doing other chores without heavy engagement.,,Though with a good voice cast, the material they worked with was poor as Moriarty and Holmes conflict was more are argie-bargie on words than the intellectual challenge of wits. Even though the fictional world, the plot still requires some suspension of disbelief on some of the events of the evil threat to work.,,The supporting characters had more interesting conflicts that could have been worked on than the main characters.,,Sounds like they want a third story but I would not be phased if it didn't happen,Well acted, fabulous plotting, tables turned and twists galore. I do hope there‚Äôs more to come in this series.,,Very entertaining from start to finish! So much fun, I throughly enjoyed every minute of it.,It was absolutely Ôøºnothing to dislike at all! I hope they would make more audio books with this type of production,I didn‚Äôt enjoy this story as much as the first one. It is still a great book to listen to. Highly recommended if you liked the first story.,Great voices , that made listening very enjoyable , pace was good  and I enjoyed listening to  a twist on our loved characters and a examination of them from another perspective.,It was a good twist, alliences and enemies, however, it does feel different from the first book, not taking away from the new cast, but I've missed the old cast..."
The Heart of the Akashic Records Revealed,"Angels & Spirit Guides,Theosophy",Religion & Spirituality,no reviews
The Fires of Heaven,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I have really tried to like these books, I had a hard time with the first one, but after plowing through it I was pleasantly surprised by books 2, 3 and 4 actually being pretty good.  This 5th book unfortunately stalls and when not boring me to sleep it annoyed me back to listening to the radio for a while.,,OK, WE GET IT, the men think the women are stubborn and the women think the men are stubborn and stupid.  Lay off it already and get back to the plot perhaps?  Books 2-4 still had some of this pointless, childish, annoying and now extremely tiring battle of the sexes stuff, but at least it didn't detract from the main storyline.  Every time this book switches to the female reader I groan because all Nineveh al'Meara does is annoy me.  Jordan should take a lesson from George R.R. Martin and the Song of Fire and Ice series - make the good characters likeable, make the evil characters the annoying ones.  This book does the exact opposite for most of the time.  Considering that 98% of the point of view is from the good characters perspective it makes for a long read.  Nineveh al'Meara finally gets served some humble pie in this book, but even that just makes her more frustrating to read about.,,My rating is a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 because there are a couple good, but short chapters from Matt's perspective.  He's evolved into the most interesting character.,,One other complaint with the series as a whole - do you think it would have been too hard for the narrators to sit down for a coffee and agree on a set of pronunciations for such minor details as character names and geographic locations?,,I'll continue to read this series, assuming the rest come out unabridged.  But I think a break and a few beers will be needed before reading 5 more books about how stubborn/stupid/arrogant/self-centered men/women are.,,Would you try another book from Robert Jordan and/or Kate Reading and Michael Kramer ?,Oh I'm sure that I will finish the series.,What does Kate Reading and Michael Kramer  bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,Experience and emotion.,Any additional comments?,Please don't take this review the wrong way because I do think that the story is great.  I just have a few issues with it.,I am about halfway through this book so far and I have to tell you that I am getting pretty tired of the gender wars.  Each gender thinks that the other is COMPLETELY stupid.  It was funny in the first book or two, but I'm pretty fed up with it now.  The book would be half as long if they just kept to the story and stopped babbling about how they don't understand each other...ever try talking!!??  Just a little miffed about it, sorry for the rant.,The other thing that is starting to get on my nerves is the characters‚Äô inner monologues.  I try and think about things in real time.  There is no way that somebody can have an inner though that would be 1000 words long when the sentence they are actually saying is 6 words.  I just picture in my head a person talking and then, mid-sentence, starring at you with a blank face while they are thinking in their head.  Just another pet peeve of mine.  Too much inner monologue, just get on with the story.  Besides, we know what the characters are thinking because they have had the same inner monologue the whole story; it‚Äôs not until the end of each book that it changes so I could do without the author repeating it every few pages.,As I am listening to the book rather than reading it (there is no way I could sit there long enough to read this series) the names are bit hard to remember.  There are A LOT of names in the story that sound very similar and it can be hard to keep track of whom the story is referring to.  That and the fact that the story jumps from character to character.,The books could have been half as long and still great.  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of unnecessary writing.,,Possibly the best so far if your following the series.  The ""Great Hunt"" a close second.  No matter how they review you cannot pick up this book in the middle.  If you've finished 1 thru 4 you should read ""New Spring"" before you do this one.  Much insight and a real good story.  In this one people are gone you would never have expected to be gone.  Rand is slowly becoming someone you'd never recoginize from the first book.  I just wish audible would not offer 9 out of 10 books in a series and leave out #5 for so long.  The average member is not looking that far ahead when he/she starts out.,I've been waiting for this book a long time.,I want to finish The Wheel of Time.  But this book made me want to take a break before I move on to the 6th book.  The story mostly focuses on Nanheve and Elayne and what it‚Äôs going through their head, which 95% of the time was what they were wearing or what they don‚Äôt want to wear.  The book dragged on and on about nothing that moved the story forward the majority of the time.  If this is how all the books from here on are going to be, I don‚Äôt think I can finish these series. I respect those Robert Jordan fans who love the story.  But this book was an awful lot of nothing to do with the main plot line.  Terrible.,I have liked all of Jordan's book including this 5th book.  The only complaint I have is constant reference that Men think Women are stupid and Women think Men are stupid.  I think it is safe to say the there are times when we all share the this viewpoint but he uses it ALL the time in this 5th book.  I also had some trouble following all the various path the many characters take.  On the whole I have enjoyed Jordan's books and I will buy all the rest if they show up.  It so involved a story you can't stop at Book 5.  He makes the characters so real you can't help but want to know what happens.,I've really been enjoying this series, and was overjoyed to see that Audible got the unabridged version of the Fires of Heaven. I enjoyed this book immensely, and look forward to Audible getting the UNABRIDGED versions of the next 3 books (hint hint).,slowly getting better.  but the author still has fits of going on and on about every little detail in the background.   and of course the over bearing women and weak men.   This is the first author I've wanted abridged versions from.,So.. First book was fun because it was new..,Kids going on journeys with a nanny sorceress,With character names so similar it's so hard to keep track.. With main characters and others..,Melayne Moraine,Elaine, Egwaine.. it's a major Paine,General plot formula is same thing over and over (and over and over) :,Group of teens learning they have special abilities..,Adventure after adventure kids learn new abilities and find new magical items to fight new monsters.. As they meet new peoples in new lands,Teens repeatedly making rash decisions like teens do for their maturity level.. leading to a few teen relationship micro-dramas,But holy crap batman. Every book since the first is the same thing.. Following the teens over a course of years,This book introduces new magic monsters and abilities etc. in the same repetitive way with ONE new element,Teen crushes and dramas as their teen gonads rev up,If you're an adult the teen foibles might not add any enjoyment.. For teens I suppose it would be more relevant.,I quit.,The narration is fantastic. Both actors amazed me.  Great world crafting by author. Unfortunately the characters are so stupid I just can't listen to more. Openly humiliating each other for not knowing things which they couldn't.    Being offended at another character's offer of protection, then demanding it on threat of physical violence two days later. Screaming at others to mind their own business even as they secretly use their own powers to invade people's dreams.  And these are the characters who are friends. It's  just all to stupid to endure.,Pulled in by the Eye of the World and the Great Hunt, I have become attached to the series, but this will be my last Jordan book.  The plot becomes ever more meandering, with hundreds of pages passing and little or no action taking place.  The characters wallow in adolescent angst.  They are strangely attracted to, but disgusted with, the opposite sex, tantalized by nudity, but ashamed of their own bodies.   Like teenagers they spent a lot of time obsessively discussing the object of their affection, and then denying the crush exists.  For people supposedly engaged in a battle to save the world (and entering their early twenties), they are unbelievably self-absorbed and naive.  The writing is adequate, not awful like Terry Brooks, but the dialog is so corny I cringe to hear it.  My advice is to take a pass on this one.,Now, I don't have problems with sexist themes, but every third sentence is ""men are this, men are that"".,I get it, all women in this book think that men are incompetent, bumbling idiots. And that's fine.,But having this repeated over and over again made this book barely tolerable.,Good performance and production. The story itself could have really done with an editor.,,Done it!  Listened  while working through the whole 14 books. Not bad - not brilliant either. Too much describing of what are people wearing, limited dictionary of dialogues and male-female relationships/interactions painfully similar, predictable -boring  (Mr Freud would find it certainly interesting though :),Maybe because English isn't my first language,  maybe I'm spoiled by other writers or maybe  Robert Jordan just isn't my type of author but haven't I been working at the time of listening I would considered it time wasted.,amazing book definitely parts that drag, an some characters seem to be losing their personality an just being moody instead, also don't see rand liking any of these girls for any other reason than their hot and kinda begging it, weakest part definitely the menagerie,One of the less exciting books in series even with the fantastic performance of the narrators. The story seems to drag at this point, I found it hard to pay attention and very nearly struggled to finish it.,Years past, I read this series at a relative gallop, loved it & am listening through it now. The tale is just as captivating as I remembered. The interweave of perspective, especially in the penultimate chapter, holds just as strongly as before.,I have read all the Wheel of Time novels before (more than once), but with the last book on its way, it was time to update myself on the story.  This was made so much easier by plugging into audible. My family found it quite annoying as I spent so much time listening, but not to them.,I loved the double narration which divided the story into its male and female halves.  And Robert Jordan's story, which I have been following since 1996, is an absolute winner.  Love it!,This is one of the best fantasy epics ever written, a series right up there with the work of J. R. R. Tolkien but be warned it is not one to be taken up lightly, this series is Huge!,The books have been kept together so one audio book will get you one book and many hours of happy listening.,Sadly Robert Jordan died in 2007 after publishing book 11, but with the help of Jordan‚Äôs wife/editor Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson has taken up the torch, using Jordan‚Äôs plentiful notes he is finishing off the series brilliantly, with book 14 being the final volume.,The series is voiced by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading throughout and their performances are exemplary, their narration brings the world to life in a way that simply reading it never had for me, they bring a unique voice and feeling to each of the characters that brings them to life and firmly embeds them in your heart.,The only negative I have to put in is that the audiobooks chapter division bears no relation to where the chapters start and end in the books making the chapter search and snooze modes on the app all but useless.,All in all a five star read. An absolute must for any fantasy epic fan.,,First of all I must ask forgiveness for my review of Book 6, which I wrote before writing this review. I stated therein that the battle at the end of Book 6 at Dumai's Wells was the first real battle since the taking of Tear at the end of Book 3. However, clearly this is not the case as in book 5 there is a major battle for Cairhien with the Shaido. Not to play this battle down, either as it is when Mat begins to command his own troops through loyalty and strategy gained through his forrays into the Aiel Waste in Book 4.,There are several key battles, however, through the book which just take your breath away, and the battle for Cairhien was not one of them, though it is well presented and exciting enough to move the story along. The battle at Dumai's Wells was the next key battle in my opinion.,However, the rest of the book far exceeds expectations as characters really develop, Elaine and Nynaeve running from Tanchico, trying to find the rebel Aes Sedai, and avoid Elaidas attempts to capture them. Egwene, learning the crafts of the wise women Aiel and developing as a dream-walker. One wonders if maybe Egwene is Taveren as well as Mat, Perrin and Rand!,Rand finally finds a teacher of Saidin, though in the most unlikely of places, and he starts to really develop as Aes Sedai in his own right. And it is here that Lews Therrin starts to coalesce in Rand's mind.,just take my money already. I love this series more each day. time after time,Such a great story with so many things happening and I really want to know whats happening next. Though the female characters are nearly always complaining and whining that it's hard to like any of them and found myself getting frustrated because of it. Was read very well as usual and despite my negative points, I'm listening to the next one.,much better than the last. worth moving onto the next. I am surprised as the writing style seems to have changed, almost faster or more directional rather than the circles of before,So addictive the more you read and the last few books in this series is epic,Overall story arc is good but way too many characters commenting on what they percieve is the opposite sex‚Äôs viewpoint. Who cares? Rather distracting and I feel simply pads the story out. It‚Äôs fine to establish a characters viewpoint and flaws etc but it seems half the book is filled with silly comments on what/how the opposite sex thinks. Generalisations galore.,Also the actual action scenes are rather short and lacking detail yet we get pages and pages on boring bits in between.,I give the overall series so far a 5 out of 10 simply because of these.,2nd time through and it is still brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant,  brilliant,  brilliant,  brilliant,  brilliant,  brilliant, brilliant and once again brilliant.,was a great book. can't belive Morain is has died...  can't wait to listen to the next one.,There is too much repeating from previous books to make this a really good listen. The characters should just talk to each other and the whole thing would be done, most frustrating,Completely and utterly insufferable.,The older I get, the worse they are.,The story is great, but it would have only needed half the amount of books if the female characters spent less time pretending they know everything and ""smoothing their skirts"" or tugging on braids.,,This book took the story completely off the rails, I'm not sure why the story went from good to fine to unfinishable but the way the author writes every female character in this book is actually just really unrelatable. It was just unfinishable for me, I tried because I really enjoy the first couple of novels and I put so many hours into the story already but this long drawn out tale just didn't do it for me, I had to give up close to the end.,Women are not always just obsessed with men looking at their bodies in every waking (and sleeping) moment and furiously blushing yet secretly enjoying at the thought of being sexualised nor are men unable to talk to or understand any woman in existence and they don't just shake their head at the insanity of any word spilling out of a womens mouth at any point, no matter how long they've known each other or what they've been through.,But to those that enjoyed it, good on you, I would have like too aswell, so I hope you had a good adventure.,alot happens in the book so the pacing is well maintained even though alot of it is traveling from one point to another, the absence of a certain character was a disappointment to me, I won't say who but to a fan they are missed."
Emily Wilde's Map of the Otherlands,"Action & Adventure,Fairy Tales",Science Fiction & Fantasy,no reviews
The Stand,"Horror,Suspense,Fantasy,Post-Apocalyptic,Apocalyptic Fiction",Literature & Fiction,"Before I get into my review, I have to say I've been terribly disappointed in a lot of the reviews of this book. The book is almost 48 hours long, yet most people barely have two sentences to say about it. I know most people have read this edition before, but for people like me, there aren't that many helpful reviews.,I've read many many books in my time, but nothing has ever captured my attention the way The Stand did. It starts off with a sick man plowing into a gas station and spreading the disease to about 3 or 4 people there. However, what intrigued me the most was not the characters themselves, but how they changed and grew. There are some obviously ""Good"" people, and there are some ""Bad"" ones. However, I felt like King also put some in the middle. He left room for people to change. The story, for me, was not predictable or dull, and by my experience, most 48 hour long books do get dull somewhere. This one never did. The narrator was fantastic. I thought he did a fabulous job. I can't recommend this book enough. I'm glad I started it, but I will warn you, you won't want to put it down. I finished it in 6 days if that tells you anything. Thank you audible for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece. I will definitely be revisiting it again.,I have seen some complaints about people not giving an idea of what the story is about, so here it is briefly: It is not a ""horror"" novel, even though it is billed as one. In the beginning of the story a super flu wipes out most of the earth's population. There is no gratuitous gore, but there are some scenes dealing with lots of dead people. The rest of the book is about the struggle of the survivors to survive, and the battle between good and evil, God and the devil.,Stephen King's talent lies in his ability to spin a tale, to develop interesting characters that you can relate to, to put you in the mind of his characters, and make you live the story. In that regard this is one of his best works. I first read the original story probably 25 years ago, and it made a lasting impression on me. The extended version is even better.,Highly recommend this one. At first I had a neutral opinion of Grover Gardner' s voice, but after a while I grew to enjoy his narration quite a bit.,I've read this complete and uncut novel before, as it was available via the National Library Service for the Blind.  But alas, it was just available for rent.  But now, some 22 or so years since it was released in its entirety, I couldn't help buying it.  It was actually the first thing I did when waking up on Feb 14th since audible gave me the heads up concerning it arriving on audio.,Don't pass this title up.  Most of King's fans say that it is his best work ever.  Well, for me it ties with It and The Dark Tower series.,Having read both versions-- this uncut doorstop of a novel, and the dinky little 800 someodd pager published in the late 70's...  I prefer the one you're hopefully about to download or have already downloaded.  I wouldn't have purchased the original edited edition if Random House had released it.  So don't let the title confuse you, folks.  It is indeed the complete and uncut edition, and well it should be. King himself says he can't abide abridged audio books.  Well spoken, wordslinger!  And we all say thank ya.,My opinion of said novel?  C'mon, it's Stephen King.  And it is one of my all time favorites which I at long last own.  It's a post apocalyptic epic featuring one of the best villains of all time.  It's got romance, horror, etc.  Just use a credit and buy it already!  Now to submit this and take care of this bothersome stuffy nose and cough of mine.,Would you consider the audio edition of The Stand to be better than the print version?,From what I've listened to so far the narrator (Grover Gardner) does a great job!  He pulled me into the story with no distracting affectation that you get from so many other recorded books of the horror/fantasy genre. However, the daunting 48 hour listen may have me augmenting the audio edition with my paperback.,What other book might you compare The Stand to and why?,Grant's Pass - by Amanda PIller. A post-apocalyptic anthology, well written and very fun to read.  At times I felt that this collection was the 'lost chapters' of The Stand.,Swan's Song - A very good read in the same vein, Robert McGammon is another of my favorites (unrelated but other great books by him: Boy's Life and Going South),The Road - by Cormac McCarthy.  Grittier and darker than The Stand but evocative (the book is better than the movie and I liked the movie),,Which scene was your favorite?,Gosh, so many! - the tunnel, the...hey, I'm not gonna spoil this for first timers! Read it and love it!  Once everyone is up to speed, I may update this.,Any additional comments?,To all those folks who won't read this just because it's by Stephen King - please do yourself a favor and get this book.  Although is has some 'horrific' scenes, the character development and story arc are some of the best I've ever read.  Don't be put off by his reputation as Master of Horror - he's also a Master Storyteller; remember, this is the same author who gave us Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.,Now, if we can just get Peter Jackson to take a peak at this little book....,47 hours. I listen mainly on the way too and from work. This took almost two months to finish. There were times that I was ready for it to be over.. but then something so poignant and superbly written would be read by Grover Gardner and I was in love with the book all over again. I know that King wanted this to be his ""Lord of the Rings"", his epic tale of the fight between good and evil and it was thrilling and gripping and left me laughing and smiling and loving the characters. I loved how well Grover Gardner narrated the different voices for the characters. He truly is one of the best out there. And every time Tom Cullens says, ""Laws yes"", I had to smile. Fantastic book. Don't give up on it- go on the journey, you won't regret it!,,,Unlike many diehard King Fans, I never read The Stand as a teen. In fact, I only got into King after appreciating much of his later work, like Duma Key, Under the Dome and 11-22-63. This completely unabridged reworking of the original, with many previously cut passages re-added by he author, is a gem. A vacation for the brain. Normally, I view a book this long (48 full hours!) as a mountain to scale. But King turns long works into something more like a wave that is ridden. I listened to the whole thing at normal speed, with complete and utter enjoyment. The characters in this book are both lovable and despicable. There's no waste or self-indulgence here. Just damn good storytelling. More. Please.,I downloaded this just as soon as it showed up and so far I can tell you a couple of things:,#1. The reader is doing his part and his style fits what I was expecting!,#2. The story, for those that don't know what it is about, is classic King but with an apocalyptic type of plot. The character building is huge and wonderful here but don't worry your self as it DOES NOT SLOW DOWN THIS BOOK at all. King gives us maybe the biggest and best set of characters that he has ever had published and I'm not kidding about that!!!,#3. The overall feel of this classic is ....well it's just classic! It got me from the first few minutes on and carried me on a journey that somehow leaves no doubt that I learned a few things that are useful in life, but I'm biased when it comes to The Stand as it has had a place in my heart for years. If you are looking to get into a very long book that will teach, scare, bring sadness and joy as well as new memorable characters into your thoughts then you have found a classic for sure!,,Just keep that in mind that many of us readers are revisiting this book in it's new form and are only looking for word that the reader has delivered what Stephen King wrote for us many years ago so all the reviews may not be what a new reader is looking for.  I hope I was able to give you a review that will help in some way.,Story starts off great. Good world, great characters. About half way through the book the story completely falls apart. King is completely focused on his characters and lets the narrative fall apart. Ends up  being unreadable. There is no narrative holding the world together. It is just an initial world and some characters run amok. It feels like King had no idea how the book was going to end. He just had an initial premise and some interesting characters, put them together and wrote the book chapter by chapter. I am all about character development, but without a good STORY to place the characters into, a book becomes an exercise in character development rather than an interesting piece of fiction. Terrible book.,One of my favorite books of all time.  I'm sure I've read it a dozen times over the years.  I am so happy to have the audio version finally.  I don't think I need to critique or review the book much more than to say if you're a Stephen King fan, you know this is one of his best books.  And if you're NOT a King fan necessarily, this is one of his novels like the recent JFK assassination novel that you might find accessible.  One of the classic post-apocalyptic books of the genre.  THANK YOU AUDIBLE!,I can't say that this is my very favorite SK book ever, but I did really love it. I liked the characters so much. Nick who couldn't hear or speak yet he had so much to say and many people followed him. I have had dreams like this where we are all beginning again and SK makes it all come alive in his book. Grover Gardner is one of my favorite narrators ever, what talent!!!!! Yea this is a good one for sure."
US Army Insider Missions 2,"Military & War,Unexplained Mysteries",Biographies & Memoirs,I absolutely love this book. I still don‚Äôt know why the Government isn‚Äôt talking about it except behind closed doors in the USA. But I am glad Michael is. I hope he does a follow up on this one and the last one. Things are finally getting answered if you have always had questions about where you came from and what went wrong. Michael if you read this Thank You for what you are doing.

Too Late,"Psychological,Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","The story itself is very graphic and vulgar‚Ä¶ not unlike Hoovers other books, but definitely worth noting. It could be very triggering for some.,The narration was honestly painful to listen to. The girls voice was monotone, deep and annoying. Carters voice was rushed and he kept taking deep breaths each sentence‚Ä¶ I found it very distracting. Overall didn‚Äôt love it! Had some good twists and turns but wouldn‚Äôt recommend or read again!,A surprisingly good suspense tale is defeated by an author's lazy reliance on the F word for dialogue.  The plot can be summarized by characters say F, F, F.  Assault. Sloan cries. Repeat.,,Good book, read in a day had me wanting to keep on reading. For sure didn‚Äôt see all the triggers coming. For sure need a trigger warning for this book though!,This was another great book and it went fast!  Loved it from the start to the end!,Another great book by Colleen Hoover! Easy to follow along with & a good story. I hope she will release another one following this story.,I don‚Äôt know where to start. I have read and enjoyed so many Hoover books. Usually without reading the title details. The subject matter, the characters, the female narrator, the dialogue. All bad! I stuck it out hoping there would be a nugget in there of the usual CH novels. Nope! Don‚Äôt bother.,This was a really great book. I liked the different different perspectives--especially that of the narcissist, sociopath.,Well done!,Another great book of Colleen Hoover!! This is one of my favorites and I look forward to reading/listening to more.,love this book. I literally to audiobooks pretty much 24/7. I really enjoyed this one,,Love love loved it! Another awesome story Colleen! Narrators did a great job. I will definitely recommend this book!,If you‚Äôre a CoHo fan you‚Äôll love this. The story was great. A little predictable, but she manages to write from the perspective of a psychopath a little too well!,The narrator choice was awful. The voices, particularly Sloane and Carter were robotic and unnatural. The female narrator had a strange cadence to her voice that just didn‚Äôt work for her character. She sounded like a news reader!,Such a great story filled with lots of twists and turns. Great characters and performed really well üòä,Brilliant from start to finish gripping and makes you want to listen on to the next chapter one of her best books yet,Great book. One of the best from Colleen yet - full of emotion, twists and turns,Highly recommend,,I couldn‚Äôt stop listening to this ! It was a really good read . The author was recommended to me, I normally listen to romantic thrillers, crime , true stories . These books are great, this book is my favourite so far ! X,I thought one of the narrators was rushing the sentences. The book as a whole wasn‚Äôt her best work. It was about 2 hours longer than needed and was very predictable. I did enjoy it however, the bones of it had potential.,this book is the best I've read in a long time. couldn't stop listening. felt so involved and yet so anxious! brilliant.,I really enjoyed this! More than I thought I would after the first few chapters. Definitely stick it out. There were more twists than I expected, and it kept me gripped right until the end. Love, Sex, Drama & Thrills!,Literally couldn‚Äôt stop listening, so much drama! Great story from start to finish. 10/10,Couldn‚Äôt stop listening, definitely recommend this book, a great mix of love, lust and horror,Extremely disappointed by the graphic Blasphemy that continued throughout this book. I am offended greatly, will never purchase another Colleen Hoover book again,Very well written book and great narrators. Could not put it down.,May be triggering for some.,Too late & verity - top 2 Colleen Hoover books I‚Äôve read so far!! I binge read Chapter 40 onwards in one sitting. Couldn‚Äôt put the book down! Love!,This book was awful. Colleen needs to stop romanticising domestic violence and women being ‚Äòrescued‚Äô by men.,I hated Sloan and Carter more than any other characters. The plot seemed so implausible, unrealistic and just plain bizarre to me as someone who worked in criminal law for 5 years.,Interesting and exciting from start to finish. My favourite of Coleens books so far . Definitely worth the read .,Another great read from this author. Love that I have discovered her! People have told me these books are for teenagers. I am 54 and I‚Äôm loving all of them.,,Loved it!,The story moved along at a brisk pace and was full of twists and turns. I never saw this ending coming after the first couple of chapters.,It‚Äôs not often in an audiobook that the performance so far outshines the prose.,Whilst an interesting premise we are faced with an almost unlikeable protagonist, antagonist and a storyline that whilst making sense does return to a formulaic base of a female victim of domestic violence who continues a pattern of conditioned behaviour even into her new, supposedly healthier relationship.,Well read overall, good audiobook for a drive or in the background. Not Hooper‚Äôs best work, but an ok piece.,performance was great.,the story was not up to the usual engaging colleen hoover standard. I was not invested or caring about the characters. usually I can get a tear or two in her books, but not this one. the characters are fairly one dimensional. the female protagonist is weak, not self empowered at all, cries every five seconds, and generally quite self centered (except for her brother being her motivator, but the depth of their connection was told but never felt). the protagonist learnt to lean on one man then another, snore.,so much more could have been developed with the under cover cop situation, there was so much potential! I still listened till the end, so it can't have been terrible but definitely not up there with the greats.,Such a great listen. I couldn't stop listening because I needed to know what else Asa was upto and how Sloan was going to manage it.,highly recommend üëå"
A Court of Frost and Starlight,"Fantasy,Epic,Fairy Tales,Paranormal",Romance,"I absolutely love this series, but I struggle through the current narrator's performance. There is way more distinction between characters and their personalities, and characters speaking and the narrator with Jennifer Ikeda's performance in ACOTAR and ACOMAF.,Every single character has lost something in this book's performance. They actually feel like completely different versions of themselves that aren't as complex and well-rounded as they were before.,I never thought a voice performance could change a story and its characters so much, but here we are.,The book itself is a wonderful companion to ACOWAR. It's great to learn more about Velaris and how everyone is fairing after the war. It definitely leaves you looking forward to the next book.,I am a diehard fan of this series. That said, this could not have been more of a disappointment. This wasn‚Äôt a book, rather it was a short story of two weeks in the lives of characters who are normally complex and are simply in between stories and aren‚Äôt sure what to do. There is overwhelmingly long and unnecessary description of shopping for presents, overwhelmingly long and unnecessary description of opening presents, totally unnecessary descriptions of Feyrah having a period, completely ridiculous scenes of warlords having a snowball fight, and heavens above can all the obsession with painting just stop? It is too clich√© for this series. Basically the whole thing is just far reaching and doesn‚Äôt give us any bit of the characters we have come to love. There is not a plot, it‚Äôs simply them existing in Valaris before a plot actually happens. Nothing that happened in the war at the end of the last book seems to matter. Nesta couldn‚Äôt be more annoying and tortured, same with Lucian. Nobody has evolved. It seems like an unnecessarily long introduction to a book that never happened. I think all 229 pages could have been summarized in one short chapter.,As a HUGE fan of this series... this was such a disappointment. Paint, buy gifts, and no questions answered. That is the book pretty much summed up. I know that this was a bridge to spin offs but this could have been done so much better. I almost wish that I would never have read it and just read the spin offs.,,I wanted sooooo much more out of this book after waiting so long for it!,That's basically what this is. While I knew it was a novella, I was hoping for something akin to Tower of Dawn, where we'd see more of the story/character arc for some of the other characters.,If you just want to visit with the characters you should enjoy it. I was hoping for a bit more.,,So this was just a ‚Äúfiller‚Äù book as I call them. It should not have been marketed as a whole book and should have been a .5, not the next full book in this series. It was short and not a lot of important things going on, or anything for that matter. Pretty sure this was just a book for the author to make more money. Also, the main character, is not the same as she was. In the past books she was strong and independent, in this book... she‚Äôs a busy body upper middle class person that drinks wine every night and leads a boring life. Not to mention that this book should have also been titled ‚Äú50 Shades Of Fairy‚Äù because all they talk about is how much they enjoy having ‚Äúrelations‚Äù with one another... eye roll. Best advice, don‚Äôt waste your credit, you‚Äôll just be disappointed.,I absolutely loved all the previous books in this series. But this one is just painful. It seems like it was written in a rush, the story and characters are flat and it lacks the emotion and humour of the previous books.,I‚Äôm really not happy with the narrator. Her voice barely changes between characters, making things very confusing. The way she reads Rhys‚Äô  parts really bothers me. I hope there‚Äôs a new narrator for the rest of the series.,I have loved this series...but this book was terrible. It was nothing but a romance novel. No plot. Nothing happens. I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed and underwhelmed I was when I finished listening. I cannot believe Sarah j. Maas would put her stamp of approval on this book.,The story is quite disappointing. The book reads much like a fan fiction rather than a series.,I absolutely loved the first 3 books of this series. This was my favorite series for a long time. I think that ACoWaR would have been better had they kept Jennifer Ikeda- she's an amazing narrator, and really brings each character to life. It's so easy to tell who is talking when she narrates a story.,,This book was so disappointing. Up until now, all of the books were from one point of view. I could have managed the sudden switch to different POVs had the narrator differentiated the voices. Amren has a stilted speech pattern, but everyone else sounds the same. Without the beginning of each chapter stating whose POV it is, you just have to listen long enough to pick up context clues (so beware if you have to pause for a while). It felt very forced to have Feyre change her mind from wanting to spend time with Rhys and figure out what her life is now to deciding to give him her 'gift' in 6 months. Especially considering that they see one another so little and they know that there are still battles to be fought in the near future.,,Like another reviewer stated, it felt like a Christmas Special. I've been so excited for this to come out, and am so disappointed by both the story and the narration.,I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened!!!!!! The entire story. I really liked the previous books in the series but this is basically a porno, filled with virtue signaling. I am a big fan of this series... but this is a super disappointing book."

Murder on the Cornish Cliffs,"Amateur Sleuths,Cozy,Historical,Women Sleuths","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Another wonderful entry in the series. Awaiting the next entry and perhaps a wedding may occur; any time now!,This cozy mystery series is delightful and never disappoints. Amazing varied voices by the presenter, great talent!!,I love this author. The characters she has created are likeable and very entertaining. The stories are always surprising and interesting.,I adore these stories! There is one thing wrong‚Ä¶ she doesn‚Äôt write faster enough!,Thanks for a great story and terrific story!,Love the humour, writing & history lessons all in one. As usual well worth the wait!,Enjoyed this thoroughly.  Fab narration as well.  Looking forward to Eleanor Clifford and Sheldon‚Äôs next adventure."
Kingdom of Ash,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"While I would have liked to have finished this series, there was so much time spent on descriptive torture that I had to keep skipping ahead by chapters. And really, it dragged so much that I gave up. This series had so much going for it in the beginning, but I can't get behind torture for no reason. It really didn't seem to assist the story at all. And I stopped caring what happened to anyone due to how slowly the novel progressed.,I waited almost 2 days before I finally settled down to do a review for the last book in my favorite series. I was left stunned, speechless and sobbing tears of joy and sorrow. I think I cried about 80% of the time during this book because it's just so heavy with action, romance, suspense and heartbreak. Sarah J Maas just kept me on the edge of my seat and even though I had so many theories of how the book was going to go down she just kept blind siding me with twists and turns I had never even imagined would happen! I won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil anything for anyone but if you're a lover of the series you will thoroughly enjoy this but you will also have a wicked book hangover. I want more and not because SJM let me down but because she blew this one right out of the water. I'm so incredibly happy to have an ending to the series but I so want a spinoff for some of the other characters. I never wanted this journey to end.,An absolutely amazing final installment in the Throne of Glass series. I cried I laughed I had so many feels during this book. I can not recommend it enough.,Unfortunately this last book was a let down, it ended as we thought but was mostly drawn out and in some ways a little predictable. I enjoyed the other books and looked forward to an ‚Äòepic‚Äô ending but was left a little dry. It is definitely still worth reading/listening to though!,While I've really enjoyed this series, it is heavy and dark. Sarah J. Maas draws it out much too long which makes it difficult to start the next book or finish the series. This is not a series that once completed, you will ever reread or start again. It's a one-time read/listen that is also too winding and complicated to fully remember the intricacies and interwoven sub stories tied to the characters.  The drawn out nature of the writing urges the reader to skip ahead, but if you do, you will be too lost or have missed too much to understand.  It's a frustrating experience and not in a good way when you internally are urging both author and narrator to ""get to the point"" of a chapter and move on. The narrator - Elizabeth Evans - did a good job given that these worlds are fiction as are the accents and dialects of the (too) many complicated characters. I'm not sure I will pursue or endeavor to read any other titles by this author as it is a commitment and feat to complete without the reward of truly remembering and wanting to relive the facets of the worlds created within the pages.,While I realize that I'm a bit older than the target demographic for this series, I can say that the Throne of Glass series started out really strong for me; however, the last 2 books really felt like the author was just looking to provide readers with an ending for the story.,,The surprising twists & turns, the shocking losses of key characters & the intricate worlds that were the greatest parts of the first books of the series gave way to focusing on the romantic well being of the main characters & making sure that everyone was in love with a bright future ahead.  Having the chaos & hardships endured by these characters finish up with everyone living happily ever after was unrealistic & very disappointing... it left the story with a falseness at the end where you were waiting for that one last challenge from the pervasive evil of Morath... but it never came.,I have read the fantasy genre since before it was cool to read. And Maas had a really stellar series going with several smashing female protagonists (though the main character feels a bit like Nicholas Cage - has about three basic expressions). I was really looking forward to the final book...annnd....nope. The first third of the book does well, but after that it feels as if Maas just needed to get the thing written and done. The plot twists and reveals she's had in the other books are just not there. This is pretty straightforward vanilla by comparison. Having said that, it's still very satisfying to see most of the loose ends tied up. It just can't measure up to the rest of the series for excitement and innovation. #ChosenOne #FemaleProtagonist #Magical #tagsgiving #sweepstakes,I am am absolute lover of this series and of high fantasy books in general. I personally loved Tower of Dawn, and if you haven't read it you absolutely have to before diving into this or you will be lost on Chaols storyline. I cannot believe this series is over, and props to Sarah J. Maas at what an amazing accomplishment.,That being said this finale does not hold a candle to other epic fantasy series finales in the completion and way it was written such as: Harry Potter (which who the hell else can compete with JK Rowling, but its ok) Any Brandon Sanderson series finale, George RR Martin, The Wheel of Time series, Lord of the Rings.,*spoiler ahead*,It was unnecessarily descriptive I found myself skipping ahead minutes at a time because it would be ""witty"" banter or descriptions of things I've basically heard over and over already. I must have heard the phrase ""well and truly"" a million times and ""pine and snow scent"" another million. It got a little tiresome. Also, there were times when I thought oh this wasn't edited very well because Dorian mentions ""Earth"" and all I thought to myself was he is in Erilea, how the hell does he know what Earth is? I was happy that there were less sex scenes, but sometimes there were still whole chapters literally dragging out and dedicated to sex that did not advance the plot whatsoever. Pretty much everybody pairs up eaxctly like you think they will.,There is some heartbreak in the finale. However, I honestly never got the feeling any main character was going to die at any time throughout the book. Which predictably, literally every main character lives, only tiny side characters die. Not saying I didn't feel immensely sad when the 13 sacraficed themselves but you don't know all of them on a personal level. Gavriel was also a great character but he was not a huge part of the storyline to have his loss feel gut renching. The only part I felt most anxious was with Aelid and Lorkin trying to make it back to the gates. Also, how Aelin defeats Maeve was kinda implausible. She barely has any magic, but yet still somehow opens a giant portal for an army to come through without burning herself out.,if you are a fan of the series it is a must read but it is very predictable every step. There are no huge twists that make say oh I didn't see that coming like in the Deathly Hallows.,I wont say much so that nothing is spoiled but, this book is amazing. I loved it.,The amount if times I cried in this book is astronomical. I have never felt such an attachment to characters as I do when I read a book written by Sarah J. Maas. An amazing end to an amazing series.,No time is wasted in recapping what has gone before . Do not attempt to read this if you haven't read all previous books in the series.,,There are three distinct groups / story arcs travelling towards each other for the final big show-down.  There is no treading lightly around a big ending, and nothing held back in the violence of the battles.   It's a well conceived final instalment, with very few loose ends.,,I did find the writing a little uninspiring at times.  The same descriptors repeated over and over  (up, up, up and dive, dive, dive), and the sex scenes a little gratuitous and samey, and a good editor might have been able to tighten it all up.  However, despite these few gripes (I know I'm of the fussy variety), the plot is still good, and although the final outcome is not unexpected, it doesn't all go to plan and therefore it keeps it interesting.,,It's been a good series, and one I've enjoyed from start to finish.   It didn't lose any momentum in this final instalment, and in the end, it was all quite satisfying.   It helps that I've always enjoyed the heroine -  and her character development is solid and consistent throughout the series.,,Narration is ok - occasionally jarring, but on the whole it's alright  (but that might be more the writing not being up to par in those places, than the narration's problem).,I truly didn't want this to end and would love a novella follow up of each of the power players maybe 5-10 years in the future,Fantastic narration of wonderfully emotive and dramatic writing. Perfect combination of storytelling to bring this story to a satisfying ending.,Stop what you are doing and read this book now! I love this series and this book is perfect!,I just finished all the books and I am speechless I must say the story all the characters are just fantastic.,Elizabeth Evans  üòä have amazing voice and made all the characters more a life. I can't believe is finished now . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,,This is an amazing book, but not appropriate for 13s and under. A few racy scenes, overall, 20 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü!!!,So well read and performed (even if the Scottish accent was, at times, clumsy) and I appreciated the differentiation in tone and pitch for each character. What an incredible end to my favourite series of books! I‚Äôm so sad it‚Äôs over!,I love her writing and the characters.  3rd time through the entire series. definitely won't be the last üòä,The narration was on point. So sad that this is the end of a whole world I was living in for months.,Loved the multiple plots, and huge detail through out. Great characters,flaws and all !!!,Brilliant finale,This last book bar the last half dozen chapters was all fighting and there‚Äôs just so many times you can be interested in how many are dead.,The last battle was even a disappointment to me. This series could have ended at book six, I feel the Author just dragged out the story for this last book. My advice is skip the first thirty hours and enjoy the last three.,Spoilers!,Not normally the type to leave a review but I was left quite disappointed with this last book.,The previous book left us knowing that either Dorian or Aelin would have to sacrifice themselves. Not ideal, but I would have preferred that outcome over SJM waving her magical plot wand and making all those issues mean nothing in the end.,At least with the death of a MC I would have felt something. Instead the predictability was way too distracting for me to care over much.,I love SJM's work and was really excited to see how to she would approach such heart wrenching scenes only for them not to happen.,Overall is good, the second part of the story dragged on quite a bit, wordy and repeated information had me speeding the speech up but very glad the series is finally over.,Brilliant just perfect , I‚Äôve never cried, so many different emotions in one book , happy tears, sad tears & gut wrenching devastating ugly tears  !,An amazing end to an epic series with all the craziness expected with Aelin and her court.,i loved the other books in the series but this was such a hard slog. too long. too many boring battle scenes.,Over and over again all the World comes tumbling in sadness happyness, extinction? Worth the hole series and more!,this was an epic thrilling finally for an amazing series of books well worth getting,Could not put it down.  Wonderful story.  Beautifully performed.   A fine ending to the saga.,This book exceeded my expectations. Sarah J Maas continues to produce amazing books and this one wrapped the series up amazingly."

They played off one another perfectly and they got their HEA after both getting screwed  over by their last  relationship!,,An unforgettable book,I had already read this story and I loved all the Maxwell's stories, but Reese and Dom's was particularly sweet. Listening to it was more emotional than when I read it. The narrators made a superb job. Reese and Dom's story is not easy as she has to deal with her past and insecurities caused by it. But when she meets Dom and their relationship evolves without them noticing, that is when they head to their well deserved HEA. I voluntarily reviewed an ALC of this book.,Another excellent Layla Hagen Maxwell family book!  And Savannah Peachwood and Jacob Morgan did an excel job with the characters and the story!,Reece and Dom‚Ä¶. You have to listen to this!!! They are so good!!!,An organically endearing, slow burn, big heart romance. Reese and Dom are strangers with a common agenda, but what happens when the plans change? With irresistible characters and unpredictable emotion, Cherish Me Forever is Hagen at her best. A flavorful heartbreaker that has addictive written all over it.,I‚Äôm sad now. This book was great, but it was Reese‚Äôs story. There are no more Maxwells left that need their happily ever afters. I love the way Layla Hagen writes big families that are so close. Reese has been through hell because of her ex, so it was perfect to end with her. Plus Dom was great with her and her family.,I love my visits with the Maxwell family. For me it is like coming home. I feel like I have been waiting for Reese Maxwell‚Äôs story forever. I couldn‚Äôt wait to dive into Cherish Me Forever and it did not disappoint.,This was a well written story with characters and a story line that held me captive from the first to the last chapter.,,We have met Reese, a cousin of the Maxwell brothers in previous books and I knew that the man who captured her heart would be special.,I love stories where the relationship starts out as pretend and quickly morphs into more.,,Dominic (Dom) Waldorf is recently divorced and has tickets on himself. From the moment they met the sparks flew, Dom convinced that Reese is hitting on him but that could not be further than the truth. She is trying to avoid her ex fianc√© who is a jerk who recently married her ex best friend.,,Dom surprised Reese by volunteering g to pretend to date her and this starts a chain of events that quickly snowballs.,,Jacob Morgan and Savannah Peachwwood did a wonderful job with the narrating. Not only are their voices easy to listen to but they brought all the passion, love and drama to life for me. They did justice to the story that Ms. Hagen wove. Watching these two move from acquaintances to lovers was an entertaining journey that had me smiling and shaking my head; it was fun watching their relationship play out.,A wonderful addition to one of my favourite series.,,,Reese and Dominic both have reasons to frown on a HEA, but when they find themselves hiding out in a coat closet together, the two figure that joining together will get through the endless stares and questions.  But when her past just will not let go, Dominic finds himself wanting to help her for more personal reasons.  Can the two find love when they least expect it?  Or will her past be too much to overcome?  Layla Hagen once again combines wonderfully characters and surrounds them in a story that the listener will not be able to shut off. Getting another glimpse of the Maxwell family put family first was just the icing on the cake. The narrators were perfectly matched to the characters.,I‚Äôve been waiting for Reece‚Äôs story and Jacob and Savannah did it justice. Cherish Me Forever has everything you want in a Layla Hagen love story-strong female characters, hot alpha males, spicy romance and a tight knit family. Great way to end the Maxwells.,I thought This was the best Maxwell story so far ! I hope this series is not over !,Finally Reese has her own book.  Dominic Waldorf is a well off fashion entrepreneur and a good match for Reese.  He also has had a bad experience with an ex so there is parody.  Some minor drama but mostly a romance with some sexy scenes and plenty of family scenes.  Throughout the series Reese has had issues with her ex and had altered between needy, rightfully angry, annoyed, and weepy.  It took a while but she finally grew a spine.  Impressive given how she had a few more hits before she could confront him to get the whole truth.  Great wrap for this series though I would not be surprised if Paisley starts a next generation of stories.,The narration was pretty good as both are pros but I thought some of Jacob Morgan‚Äôs sexy scenes were not as hot as usual.  As great as his voice is, he sounded bored, dry, and tired especially in chapter 14.  That was a disappointment; everyone has off days but it should have been redone on a better day.  Anyway, if I listen again I will probably rely on reading some parts and relying on my imagination.,This one is well worth the credit.,,,I listened to the story at every opportunity and,I didn‚Äôt want it to end as it was the last in the series of the Maxwells and also Reese‚Äôs and Dom‚Äôs story was the best one.  I just wanted to carry on reading it.,With both Dom and Reese being hurt badly in previous relationships can they find they‚Äôre happy ever after with each other.,All the bumps in the road. They still were a perfect match with each other. From what started as a pretend relationship they had sparks flying from their first encounter.,This is another brilliant read and perfect book from Layla Hagen.,If you want to escape from real life then you need to read this amazing story.,4.5 stars,Cherish me Forever was the book we (The Maxwell fans) have all been waiting for. Reese has deserved a loving, caring partner since the beginning of the series and boy oh boy didn‚Äôt she get a great one!,Reese is caring and friendly but guarded after all the hurt she‚Äôs been through; Dom is possessive and sweet but jaded after going through a tough divorce. Both characters deserved a chance at HEA and Layla perfectly delivered.,Jacob Morgan and Savannah Peachwood were amazing as Dom and Reese."
Wilder Love,Sports,Romance,"The story is sad and tragic but there‚Äôs always a silver lining. I loved this story.,Oh Emery Rose.. you are absolutely one of my new favorite authors!! I loved this book!! The narrators - LOVE! So listening to the audible version of this was perfection! This story was about 2 kids who met on the beach, a surfer and a girl who had moved around so many times in her young life, she was just trying to make the best of what life had dealt her. He realizes too late that she is under the legal age. When a bully in her school confronts her about their relationship, she is faced with a life altering decision. Absolute heartbreaking the things they have to go through. Emery writes the perfect amount of angst to have you shed tears, but then will totally reward you with the happy ending that these characters deserve. I can‚Äôt wait for my next Emery Rose read.,Book was rather dull.  Probably better if condensed to fewer chapters cuz the story doesn‚Äôt need over 9 hours to tell.  Predictable,I love anything with Jacob Morgan and this wasn‚Äôt a change, seriously worth the listen!,I have to admit, as a longtime reader I'm  jaded. I felt like I knew where this was going. The beginning feels a little slow.. but Oh My Lord, Remy and Shane (and Dylan and Jim) brought me to my knees.  The narrators Jacob Morgan and Lila Winters bring this to the 10th Power!! Please feature them in your books again!!  Beautiful Couple,  Heartbreaking, Lovely Story!,This was my first Emery read and wow, what a story. Beautifully written, my lip wobbled a few times. Fantastic narration, especially from Zachary. I will definitely read the rest of this series as the audios are released. Loved it!,Emery always writes wonderful, well thought out stories. This one is no exception.  It is a great start to the series. Oh Shane! ‚ù§Ô∏è,I throughly enjoyed this book, the up‚Äôs and down‚Äôs, the joy and sorrow, the tears and the laughs, it‚Äôs a fabulous book one I‚Äôll Re listen to. The narration was on point as always with Jacob Morgan, that guys has so much emotion when he reads, drawing you in to every word, he truly is amazing‚ù£Ô∏è I‚Äôve never listened to Lila Winters, but she‚Äôs good to. Over all a wonderful listen üíù,Couldn‚Äôt seem to get into this book. I had to keep replaying the chapters because my mind wondered."
Willa‚Äôs Grove,"Friendship,Women's Fiction",Literature & Fiction,"I adored this book. It was an excellent exploration of the question of ‚Äúwhat next‚Äù for each of the characters who were all at a midlife crossroads but who truly faced different futures from their last and from each other. Her writing was captivating and gripping, and I was swept up in the emotional journey.  It was both cathartic and healing. I highly recommend it, and the narrator was outstanding.,This beautifully written book will have you considering your own ‚ÄúSo now what?‚Äù at this unprecedented moment in time. Our current pandemic affects the entire planet. And when it lifts, survivors will emerge from sheltering in place to a world disrupted. Substitute pandemic with more personal major life events and see how Laura Munson illustrates these women, raw and yearning having survived their own disrupted lives. Absent spouses from death, divorce, or divergent interests, an upended career, these women transform from anguish to acceptance, from utter despair to hope. They come to trust their hearts as they begin to know, love, and accept themselves with the same honesty they afford each other. Through a shared lens, options and opportunities surface with tentative optimism nurtured by each woman wanting the best for each other.,,At a time when we are removed from our communities and yearn for connection, Willa‚Äôs Grove demonstrates the need for real friends, supportive friends who speak their truths and create space to hold each heart and soul. You‚Äôll find yourself welcomed into Willa‚Äôs farmhouse to enjoy the sustenance of  tea or homebrew as you observe bonds being formed‚Äîstarting with one friend who brings another friend and that one brings another, comprising the diverse foursome of Jane, Bliss, Willa, and Harriet.,,It all starts with an invitation ‚Äî to the rest of your life. The timing is perfect to join this foursome and then create your own.,For me, when I see XE Sands is narrating a book, I am almost always ensured the story is rich. ‚ÄòWilla‚Äôs Grove‚Äô is no exception to my experiences. Despite the 11 hours this story uses to capture its characters‚Äô essences and elaborate on the intricacies of their lives, I completed listening in 2 days. Needless to say, I only walked away to take care of the essential parts of my day to day Life! If you are drawn to the meaningful crafting of words about the realistic challenges adult women navigate, spend time listening to ‚ÄòWilla‚Äôs Grove‚Äô; you will be satisfied.,I started this Audible book but won't be finishing it -- have ordered it from the library -- because I find the narration really annoying and distracting. I loved Laura Munson's earlier book, This is not the Story You Think It Is, so I'm sure I will love this one too, but can't keep listening!,I would never have picked up this book on my own it was suggested I read it and to be frank, it was an absolutely amazing read, full of heart and soul full of wisdom full of love. Laura is an amazing writer who makes every word on every page stand out, who makes the story come alive. in the end the reader knows how important it is to live one's heart to the fullest thank you Laura Munson. anyone who reads your book will truly live with an heart open.,,An elegant book and you‚Äôll fall in love with each of the women, their stories and the beautiful descriptions of Montana. I didn‚Äôt want the book to end. It‚Äôs a five star in every category.,I had such high hopes for this book and I listened more than half way through it but it was sooooo boring! There was some good parts but it was lacking. I love Xe Sands but she just about lulled me to sleep.,Slow, dull as nails. The reader sounded like an octogenarian rather than a 40- something.,I picked the book originally for the narrator, love Xe Sands, but was handed a gift I won‚Äôt forget. This book touched something in me that was very personal. Many years ago I lost my husband and faced what now. The author led me on a journey that I didn‚Äôt want to end. Highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever had or is having a what now.,I‚Äôve listened to this twice which is rare for me. Wonderful story and fabulous narration.,I thought I would enjoy this more, but I became rather bored halfway through and skipped to almost the end. I loved the idea but it was rather drawn out."
The Two Towers,"Classics,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"One of my favourite books read the way I'd like to be able to. Rob Inglis does this story the justice it deserves. This book is the second of three, you'll want the other two.,What does Rob Inglis bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?,Rob Inglis is an excellent narrator for these books. He performs every song with loving attention, which really elevates this performance compared with reading the words on the printed page. When I read these works, I end up skipping much of the lyrics because they are so lengthy. To hear them performed is a real treat.,Any additional comments?,I really appreciate that Audible has finally made these available.,There has been a lot of speculation about which two towers Tolkien meant. I will go out on a limb and say I think he was talking about the alliance between Isengard and Bara-dur. The fellowship has been split apart by which direction to take the ring. Frodo and Sam head for Mordor, followed  and eventually lead by Gollum. Sam doesn't trust him an inch. Frodo pities Gollum as Bilbo did and hopes he can be redeemed. Together they struggle towards what seems an impossible goal: getting into Mordor without being caught or seen. Who or what will they meet on the way? Faramir, a captain of Gondor, and younger brother of Boromir finds them in the forests of Ithilien. Will he be a help or a hindrance? Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli decide to race after Merry and Pippen who were captured by Urak-hai orcs. Can they rescue the hobbits? What awaits them in Fanghorn Forest? Who or what will they meet there? In the plains of Rohan they meet Eomer, a captain of that country. The people of Rohan are in trouble because of the treachery of Sauruman, the wizard. Can Aragorn and his friends aid them against the evil armies of Isengard? This book is a fast mover. The characters are rich and worth getting to know. The story is advanced in a pleasing/distressing way. Pleasing because they grow and evolve. Distressing because new foes are introduced and must be routed or defeated. Each character is tested to their limits. New characters add to the weaving of this tale. Better have The Return of the King ready. This book ends with characters in dire peril!,I think the second book is the best. Thanks Audible for making it available, it has taken over my commute.,As far back as the 60's you seldom saw me without a well dog-eared copy of one of Professor Tolkien's books in my pocket!,I've listened to ""the Lord of the Rings (dramatized)"" on the radio, tape and Audible - and will, likely do so again. BUT, to follow Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Aragorn, inch by inch, from the settled land of the Shire to Mordor as they face their many perils is truly a treat! Just close your eyes and be right at their shoulder as they overcome daunting odds!,What did you love best about The Two Towers?,The Tolkien series is one of my favorite reads and to narrow down any one piece would be impossible to do. I am delighted to finally find these books performed  in an unabridged manner on Audible! Rob Inglis did a wonderful job on the narration, and I found myself once again transported to the wilds of Middle Earth on a great exploration.,What other book might you compare The Two Towers to and why?,The Hobbit, the Fellowship of the Ring, and The Return of the King are all pieces of the same saga.,What about Rob Inglis‚Äôs performance did you like?,At first I was doubtful that Rob would be able to overcome the characters that Peter Jackson created in his film renditions of the Lord of the Rings series. I was very pleasantly surprised, however, as I became fascinated with Rob's portrayal of the characters. His singing voice is lovely and he was able to really pull off the characters.,Any additional comments?,If you love fantasy, you will not regret selecting this series. It will be an annual listening experience for me!,The Lord of the Rings is a true classic and if you have not experienced it (or only experienced the movies) this recording should be a wonderful experience.  This recording includes the prefix and appendices (both at the end of the recording), which might be dry for some, but is great for LOTR geeks.  Having an unabridged Lord of the Rings on Audible has been long awaited and is terrific.  If I had not been exposed to the NPR/Minds-Eye production of this series I would have been pretty happy with the narration.  The Minds-Eye production was abridged but was a really excellent performance.  Rob Ingles‚Äô narration is very good, and he does particularly well presenting the difficult epic poetry sections, but I did not much like his singing and overall a simple narration can‚Äôt compete with the Minds-Eye performances.  Nevertheless I was very happy to have this excellent unabridged version.  I started out a little unhappy with the narration, but as time went on I just became quite immersed in the story.,A timeless classic brought to life. The narration of Rob Inglis brings unexpected warmth and depth to the tale of the battle for Middle Earth. Each character is brought to life through a unique voice. Highly recommended!,I was young when I first read these books so I was excited when I found out they were finally available on Audible.com in the US. If you haven't read them in a while, LISTEN! If you've never read them, LISTEN!,Continuing the saga, this is well read. I really enjoy listening to Tolkien. His language develops into a style fitting of stories of old, and this really comes through in the recorded form."
Second Chance Mistletoe Kisses,"Holidays,Clean & Wholesome,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"Please don‚Äôt waste your time. Please do not waste your time. The narrators voice is very irritating. Please do not waste your time. Ôøº,Seemed very forced at parts, but also feel that was the narrative. Overall, would not buy again, but nice option for that hallmark kick when you can‚Äôt watch.,It‚Äôs not too bad but the whole book is basically made up of the female lead being indecisive in most of the chapters except for the last few. Her initial hesitance was expected but even her hot and cold thoughts and speeches led to too much redundancy.,I enjoyed the first few minutes I heard from a tiktok and thought it would make a fun read for the winter but the main character never developed a personality outside of her kid, chastising her kid, or having general anxiety over she kid."

With Kid Gloves Magical Mates,Paranormal,Romance,"Oh I didn‚Äôt think Logan book could be beat but this one did!!! My new number 1 best book ever loved it,I know it is authored by Macy Blake, yet it was missing the authors scope of character development. I stopped this book several times, because of lapse of Focus.  Most of the secondary characters she introduced in past books are also wrapped up and closed the story line.  This is a book  that should not have written, some characters can live on without striking them away with the pen. Also how grief was conquered with a parents loss, yeah more research was required. Wow big mistake in buying this book.  Do yourself the favor , do not buy this book.  Big Mistake!!!,An absolutely beautiful story. It's full of joy, happiness and sadness.,This truly plays with your heartstrings and it's wonderful that Ollie is going to have such a long and fulfilling life with Bayu, who suffered his own tragedy.,Macy and Michael make a wonderful pair.,I've loved Ollie all through the series, right from book 1. So to see him grown up and with a mate of his own makes me smile. but there were certainly copious tears too. And of course there's spice. loved everything about this book"

It will help you to tell your true friends apart from people who just want to use you. It will tell when to give more to your employer, or when to tone down your enthusiasm. It will warn you about going too far in your quest for power.,If you really are a power-hungry maniac, this book will do just as much to help you reach your goals as it will if you are an average joe with no ambitions. I'm an idealist myself - I like to see the good in everyone and I don't like to think of myself as someone who wants ""power"" over other people.,But that is not an excuse to avoid encountering the incredibly valuable information in this book. At the very least, it will keep you from making poor moves that will cause you to fall out of favor with others. At the most, you will be able to spot when someone else is playing ""the game"" and use their techniques against them.,I don't like to play the game myself; I don't think power is a game. But I sure as hell like to watch the people who DO live like it's a game spin their wheels as they try and fail to pin me down and make themselves look totally incompetent in the process.,If you're an honest person and if you think rewards and status should be earned by merit and not by raw power or deception, then your reputation and character will go before you and these laws of power will walk behind you.,Don't use this book to grow in power for power's sake. This is a fool's errand, and ends in your annihilation. Rather learn the laws of power to attain mastery over your own spirit, and to defend against those who would prey upon your honesty and integrity.,As a Christian I find myself struggling with these laws and approaches to power. Maybe I am naive when it comes to power, or too idealistic. This book seems to outline all the dirty tricks played by politicians to stay in power. The author seems to recommend some of the behavior we naturally disapprove of as an acceptable means to power.,So why did I listen to the whole thing? I thought about returning the book after listening to the first chapter. But I realized that even though I may dislike these ""laws of power"" they are at play in the world I live in. And even thought I do not believe I will ever live by the majority of these laws, being aware of them has helped open my eyes to what is going on around me.,So I would not highly recommend this book because there is little emphasis, if any, in character. But the book is useful in pointing out how people acquire and maintain power, and there is a benefit to being aware of how power can work.,being a trusting person by nature... and working amongst a bunch of sharks. Listening to this has helped me gain perspectives I've never considered.,Perhaps the best title for this book should be ‚ÄúA Con Man‚Äôs Primer‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Unabridged Encyclopedia of Selfishness.‚Äù An interesting look at cons and power plays throughout history, this book takes a totally amoral look at how to win at all costs.,While many of the points brought out through history are fascinating (and do provide some insights into what others may be doing to exert control or power over you), I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to use this book as a guide for my life simply because it lacks any substance that would help you create and sustain a ‚Äúreal connection‚Äù with another human being.,I find it interesting that the manuscript quotes several times from the Bible yet teaches a philosophy that is so directly opposed to what is taught there.,This is a book of contradictions (although it refers to several ‚Äúparadoxes‚Äù of power). One law tells you to take all the credit for performance while another encourages you to give your master the credit. Which is it? Yes, the points are well taken when it comes to these paradoxical principles, but mostly you‚Äôre left to ask, ‚ÄúSo WHEN do I exercise one law over another one?‚Äù,In summary, this is primarily an interesting historical read. Yes, it could help you recognize times when others may be trying to exert control or power over you, but that‚Äôs about where its usefulness stops.,This book would be more aptly titled: How to be a Psychopath: Strategies of Manipulation and Deceit.,It is an entertaining and useful, yet highly disturbing book. Now that I know the true scope of the drive for power, I see the world through suspicious eyes. If you are someone who seeks power at the expense of all else, this historical guide book will likely thrill you. If you are a  normal light hearted good natured sort, you may find this book appalling, as it reads like it was written by the devil himself. Yet you should probably listen to it anyway. If nothing else, it will alert you to the strategies of the wolves around you.,Besides all the rules themselves and the commands to use, manipulate, control, trick and destroy everyone that crosses your path, this book is primarily a collection of historical antidotes. Listening to it will increase your knowledge base of the history of some of the world's most influential power players. It will also help you be alert to such tactics in use in the present.,The narration of this book was perfect. It could not have been done better. The narrator captured the sadistic domineering feel this book requires to a tee. He was engaging and clear with a very agreeable voice and cadence.,As I wrote in my review,,,The book is a compilation of very interesting stories.,However, after several chapters, all those stories blur into an easily-forgettable  flood of dates, names, and facts.,,All you will be able to recall a day later that someone killed or betrayed someone, or lied, or spread rumors, or did something else Machiavellian.,,What's presented as ""Laws"" is is a collection of random, often mutually exclusive observations. Some people lied to get to the top, some were articulate and said a lot and tried to be in the public eye. Others got to the top by being secretive and never seen in public. Some were generous and that helped them succeed, others were greedy and ruthless.,,The book is definitely worth reading if you just want to hear a bunch of entertaining historic anecdotes. However, unless you're a student of history and know enough history to recognize the names from these stories and put them in context, if you're like most, you'll forget 95% of these stories the moment you move on to the next chapter.,,Treat this book as a great collection of interesting historic stories, but do NOT expect that you will receive a practical advice on how to influence others and achieve your goals.,Deceptive intentions are just not my way. I love great business recommendations. Second motives will not accomplish anything and karma is real.  I will go back to Brian Tracy.,great philosophies for evil people. garbage if you have a moral bone in your body.,This book tells a story of lessons that can be learned from examples of things that have happened in history.  All of the lessons revolve around a theme of what you should and shouldn't do to put yourself in the best position for power.  A little philosophical, but if you enjoy philosophy you will like that piece of it. You don't have to have ambitions of being a power monger to get a lot out of this book.  It may make you re-think how you approach things on a day to day basis.  It's a little long, but it found it to be engaging and enjoyable the whole way thru.,This book has helped me manage power hungry individuals.,This is NOT a book about morals, ethics, and hard work.,This is a book with examples of rulers inviting their adversaries to dinner and killing their entire families.,This is the perfect book for a good hearted person who can not understand why people can be so mean.,Pros: The book depicts sometimes ugly yet interesting parts of human nature, often conveniently ignored or hidden.,Cons: Some of the examples are old tales with no bearing in reality. There is no unifying set of ideas, but a collection of pieces of advice modeled after most despicable historical figures.,Most importantly, this book lacks the nuance to distinguish pure power struggles from mutually beneficial value creation. Don't believe power games are all there is to life, unless you are one of those who fill the examples in this book: warlords, con artists and politicians.,This book is really very interesting. However the examples of power are mainly from Shakespeare and folklore. This book is not scientifically based and although it is engaging and well narrated, the learning is largely negative and refers to battles that occurred hundreds of years ago. This is a despots guide to power.,I gave up after a few hours as I felt my time could better be engaged on a positive learning experience and one that perhaps had more current relevance.,However the book is very interesting.,This book has made me interested in classical history, when every move was critical to your power and often your survival too. Humans inherently become amoral when they decide to become effective. You're a member of this species, so learn these principles; play or be played.,I could write 10,000 words about how much I love this book. But I won't,If you struggle to influence people in your life and get your own way. This is the book for you.,Just be open minded to concepts that ""seem"" new but you always knew in the back of your head.,I've studied this book over and over for over a year and I'm sure you came here because you read how great it is.,And yes. It is all it's cracked up to be and more!,Hard to get into at first, but the author tells great stories. Upon realising that this has nothing to do with my life whatsoever, I enjoyed it for learning about the power plays of famous and not so famous people from history.,Great analysis of the rise and fall of power throughout history. Insightful tidbits for thought. Brilliantly read. I feel well equipped to take on the world now.,I wouldn't change a thing about this. I especially loved the narrator he was perfectly chosen,Stayed engaged all through. Formless my favourite of all. It goes without saying, careful application of the laws in this day and age is paramount.,Good list of ideas but no attempt was made to back any of them up with science or game theory. In many places, laws contradicted with each other and the concept of each law having a 'reversal' was indicitive of the laws being too broad and simplistic.,Nothing new, very repetitive. But he has a lot of interesting examples from history.,,Where does 48 Laws of Power rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,One of the best books, if you're one who strives for a better life,What did you like best about this story?,Wonderfully organised and sequenced,Any additional comments?,Just pick 3 laws that really hit you hard. Try them in your everyday interactions.,This book should be considered as staple reading for everyone who sees value in knowing the personalities they will inevitably come to deal with - its incredibly written, historical examples are accurate, entertaining and easily digestable in their own right.,,I've purchased hardcopies for myself that we're loaned but never to returned lol, copies as gifts and copies on most digital book channels.,,I can't gush enough how this book prepared me in business and in social situations ... if only I discovered this book sooner.,,All I can say is just read it, learn it, love it, live it... (and you'll thank the author 'Robert Greene' later).,,,,,Great performance, great content, great author. Amazing sums it up well. Robert Greene is a very good writer and thinker,The author just freely interpret historical event into his heart content; some of the laws contradicts the other, Talleyran become his example, in some of his 'law' as he's the perfect example of that law why he was a success; a few ""laws"" later, Talleyran doing the same thing at the same period of historical time become his model example why he was a failure.,He does have an interesting interpretation of historical events - however, historical events is also a biased documentations of past events; and the writer's interpretation made it even more biased tailored to suits his ""laws"".,Luckily the reader have a very lovely voice and intonation, which make listening to this book very interesting.,I would consider this a fiction rather than non-fiction; because even that he's using historical facts & events, the interpretation and usage of them as example was up to his heart content rather than as-is.,Interesting opinion, books based on manipulation and deceit. I don‚Äôt believe these laws will bring lasting power.,I have learnt so much in this book. This book has taught me how to be a better version of myself and helped me understand the reasons behind many actions we make today. It does not hold back on some of the brutal truths. A crucial book that teaches the essence of what makes a person powerful and influential. Honestly, you will make better choices after reading this book.,I have now purchased the hard copy and am enjoying the lessons even more, if that is possible. Unbelievably well-researched and written superbly.,This book has some great insights into how politics affect your every day life and how a bit of thought about how you operate can have significant impact on your outcomes,Often contradictory, repetitive, weak logic and generally irrelevant. This book was a waste of time and effort. The only interesting aspect was the historic examples of immoral manipulation.,Talks about each power for only a couple of minutes, then continues on with history lesson‚Äôs that put me to sleep within minutes."
The Wise Man's Fear,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Paranormal",Literature & Fiction,"This review covers the first books of the series Kingkiller Chronicles. Some fantasy can be exhausting: Dan Simmons, Brandon Sanderson, George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, even sometimes Neil Gaiman. Their stories can take your breath away but sometimes, also, knock the wind out of you with a force. Patrick Rothfuss is not about that. He is more about an easy-going kind of entertainment. These books do not knock you over with amazement, epic wars or adventure. They are more subtle and a great richness comes through in that subtlety. While usually light, do not be fooled; they contain a depth and richness that is just easy to read and easier to appreciate. This is nothing short of outstanding fantasy prose and character development. These stories are long but not too long. Rothfuss does not ramble. The continuity of the protagonist Kvothe‚Äôs stories is there but not so complex or convoluted that one can get lost over the span. While there are many characters there is a core of them that are easy to know and become invested in. The stories are more about people and their relationships than about what the wizard-in-training is actually learning and practicing. At least the first two books do not contain that much magic but they do not leave you wanting either. They only leave you in great anticipation of the next book to come in the series. Nick Podehl‚Äôs reading is impeccable. I am loathe to say this is a great book for YA‚Äôs for fear it might deter older readers from venturing here. That would be a mistake. These are great books for readers of all age or gender.,Those in fear of a ""sophomore slump"" should look elsewhere.  This is the stunningly excellent follow-up and second part of a proposed trilogy to ""The Name of the Wind"".  I devoured this book.  I am going to listen to it again with my wife, and that is a rare thing.  After finishing this wonderful tale of old evil, love, loss, mischief, grief, song, cleverness, jocularity, beauty, and fantasy.  I turned to my wife and said ""you have to read these, they are wonderful"".  Our literary tastes never cross paths, but this is a tale I don't think anyone should miss.  To not pass these along to others is neglect.,,There are passages in this book that are achingly beautiful and so well written that I dispare for all others who attempt to write epic fantasy.  There is a good deal of action too and it's never far from the main narrative of this installment.  It's just that Rotfuss crossed the line with this book.  There is passable fantasy, good, and even excellent fantasy.  This, this is pantheon fantasy, this is why I read the genre, dare I say ""tolkienesque"".  It really is that good.  What a great time to be a fantasy fan.,,The narration continues flawlessly from the first book and Mr. Podehl gives an outstanding performance.  I am rapidly becoming a fan of his work, I certainly will look for him in future listens.,,The book was great. I found it better than the first. I don't care for the way the book ended. It just ""stopped"".abrubtly. It needed a better transition spot but it is still really good. I can't believe they are talking about 4 yrs for the next book!! If I realized that, I wouldn't have started it.,I enjoyed the first book quite a lot and had high hopes for this one, but the story really bogged down a couple of times.  Felurian, the sexy fairy section, went on forever.  I felt like I was reading someone's fantasy.  I don't like romance novels and the endless descriptions of their encounters really slopped over into that genre.,The Adem mercenaries chapters were also long and tedious by the end of them.  And their world just seemed contrived.  I'm no prude, but again I found the ""you can have sex with anyone and there is no emotional consequences or pregnancy"" aspect of their culture a little too much like every man's fantasy.  I don't like to be taken out of a story by the voice of the author and I felt like that was what was happening.,All that said, I will probably listen to the last one when it comes out.  There's enough interesting going on that I want to know what happens, but I was a bit disappointed and felt the book could have been better with a judicious edit.,My expectations were extremely high after a terrific first book.The first half of this second book was excellent, but in the middle of the story, Kvothe gets sent on a man hunt with a small band of mercenaries and it started to drag. After that, the time with the Faye was ridiculous and felt like it would never end. I found myself fast-forwarding through parts. When that part of the story finally ended it then moved onto yet another irritating, somewhat boring part of the story. All the sex scenes from the middle of the story on felt out of place and out of character. And the backward, ""enlightened"" life of those in the mercenary town was just plain silly. After that, thankfully, the story turned back around and got very good again for the last 8 hours or so. It was also disappointing that this is an ""R"" rated book because I was hoping to be able to let my middle-school aged children listen to it.,The book was released March 1st. It wasn't up on audible yet so I went to a traditional book store and bought a copy.It is now 12:30 am on March 4th. I finished it 30 minutes ago, now audible has it up and I just bought a copy and am going to start it again tonight.,,I read a hundred books a year and I've never done anything like this before.,,Read the name of the wind, then read this. It's better in just about every way.,What disappointed you about The Wise Man's Fear?,Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed the first installment ""The name of the Wind"".  I really liked Rothfuss writing style and although there were things that annoyed me about the first book I thought that was a good book overall.  Now, the second installment ""The Wise Man's Fear"" is another matter.  I find it hard to believe that an author can write so much about nothing and some how people like it. 42 hours (I think the book is about a 1000 pages) and the plot doesn't progress one bit..not one bit...How can that be possible? Book two and Kvothe is still 16? I think at this pace we'll see the conclusion to the KingKiller Chronicles in 20 years, if we are not bored to death before!!!This book has NO PLOT, there is no excitement or big mystery, it only contains side events in the life of Kvothe. Events that are mostly unimportant for the plot and at times silly or boring but still they go on, and on and on. For example, all the hours/pages wasted in Dena and the Felurian. Really, what a waste of time, ink and Megabytes. Or what about the ridiculous ketan fighting thing? Really??? But of course we get no insight in potentially more interesting events. I'm starting to think that Mr. Rothfuss likes to write just to show his writing skills, just like some people like to talk just to hear themselves talk.Also, Kvothe's character in my opinions is very inconsistent in this book. At times his a very sharp/smart, street savvy, even mature, the next minute he is as naive and stupid as it comes. I found him less likeable and real because of these inconsistencies.  Lastly, during the course of this book I got a strong feeling that Kvothe never becomes all that powerful or even competent throughout his life but instead he gets lucky during certain events, which are then exaggerated by story tellers and that's why he is telling ""his real story"". Hopefully, I'm wrong and that is not the case!,What could Patrick Rothfuss have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you?,Have a plot for this book instead of writing about silly and inconsequential events.,What about Nick Podehl‚Äôs performance did you like?,Great Performance.  I think he is the reason why I continued listening.,What reaction did this book spark in you? Anger, sadness, disappointment?,I was completely disappointed with this book. Not sure if I'll continue to waste time and money in this ""trilogy"".,I listened to this book for 8 straight hours today. I had to force myself to stop listening ........and i still want to put my headphone's back on.,,,I was afraid it wouldn't be able to keep up with the last one, but thus far it has exceeded my expectations.,,I unfortunately got involved in a series that will likely never be completed. I wouldn't have started this had I known the last book would take over 10 years to ""finish up"".,Amazing book.  Amazing series.  I basically haven't done anything for the past 3 days so I could listen to it all.  Every time I read/listen to a story on this level, I feel empty when I have to wait for the next.  I agree with the extra time spent on it.  It was worth it."
Where All Paths Meet,"Mystery,Suspense",LGBTQ+,"The concept shouldn‚Äôt work, but somehow it does.  I normally avoid teen lead stories - so glad I made the exception.  Jack, and especially Holloway are cleverly conceived and practically burst from the page.   So why the four stars for story?  I‚Äôve read a lot of Gregory Ashe and at times I want a red pencil and a conflab on storyline.,Let‚Äôs talk briefly about the brilliant narrator. Tremblay does an amazing job of creating, and consistently replicating individual character voices. Slipping easily through accents and genders, he does not disappoint.,This book moves fast!  So much happens in the first 48 hours of the story - it‚Äôs crazy good how well it flows.  Hopefully you read the book as soon as it was published - I know I couldn‚Äôt wait for the conclusion of the first series.,It‚Äôs the introduction of the the rest of Holmes‚Äô family that makes this book so satisfying.  Holloway makes more sense when the plunged in the ever loving clutch of his mother and sister. TBH, I wish they were in it even more.,There are moments throughout where Holloway nearly breaks the heart, Ashe‚Äôs handling of these moments are chef‚Äôs kiss perfection.  These typically happen after a fight with Jack.  Holloway‚Äôs internal struggle is on his sleeve and we feel it.   Jack is bit much at times, but that has been consistent in all three titles.,Where I do have to nitpick is Ashe‚Äôs tendency to repeat himself.  It nearly reaches the same level as The Lamb and The Lion series (which I love and you must read if you haven‚Äôt yet!).  In moments of anger or frustration Jack or Holloway will say ‚Äú‚Ä¶you‚Äôre one of the smartest people I know‚Ä¶‚Äù. That should be something uttered once. It is repeated in similar arguments. Descriptions too. There must be other ways to describe Holloway‚Äôs hair other than aspen leaves.  These are only two examples, but this happens frequently.  Sometimes I feel that I listen for it, waiting to hear the dreaded ‚Äúsodium lamps.‚Äù,,The first book drew me in.,The second book left me scratching my head a bit.,This third one SOLD me on this crazy intertwined connection between the Holmes, Watsons, & Mortiartys!,First, thanks to the author for a copy of the audiobook. Second, thanks to me for buying the print book.,Third, here‚Äôs how it went:,No Holmes,Just Jack & Dad,Surprise invitation to a party,‚ÄúWhat are you doing here???‚Äù,Snoop snoop snoop,Murder,Set-up,Who is really killing all these Watsons?,Denial,Denial,Love love,Fade to black sexy times!,More dead people,More denial,More false leads,‚ÄúJack, where the f@$k are you?,Did Holmes really do that?,Big big reveal (and I‚Äôm not talking about murders here),Heartbreak ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π,All‚Äôs well that ends well,HFN,I hope I get to see these two in action in the future, but if I don‚Äôt, this was a very satisfying finish to this trilogy!,Amazing narration by Greg Tremblay!!!,Wow. What a rollercoaster. What an emotional ride. And so, so satisfying.,,When Gregory Ashe first announced this series, I wasn't convinced. I've never been a great fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, though I know the main ones, and I wasn't drawn in by the idea of two characters, still at school and transported to the Utah mountains, somehow acting out being Holmes and Watson.,,How wrong I was. It works. In fact, it works so incredibly well, I didn't want this series to end. Both the tropes and the characters are there, transformed, inverted, reimagined for the 21st century. And they grab hold of you as only Ashe's writing can. Jack (and Holloway) go through fire in pursuit of the truth, finally re-emerging towards the end of this final book in scenes that get you in the throat. One of many things I love about Ashe's writing is how he normalises men (and teens) crying. Showing emotion without shame and never, ever thinking it diminishes them.,,I hope there might be more. Another arc with a different nemesis? We'll have to wait and see.,,Greg Tremblay as narrator is on fire. He can convey so much range without actually really raising his voice. And he gets Holloway Holmes - reserved, rigidly under control until he isn't. Until Jack Moreno gets so completely under his guard, he's lost.,After the end of the 2nd book this book was so needed. There's still a lot of hurt to work through (and this is Ashe, you get even more added on), but it's just so satisfying when it all comes together and Jack and H get their sweet HEA. I Love Greg Tremblay's narration so much. H is not an easy character to voice, but he just nails it so dang well! And his Blackfriar was seriously menacing. I truly hope we get more of Jack and H!"
A Dance with Dragons,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I bought and listened to all 5 volumes of this series recently.   I was pleased to see that Roy Dotrice was returning as the reader for book 5.  That was until I began listening.  I can only assume that Mr. Dotrice and his director chose not to reacquaint themselves with the voices he used for various characters in the first 3 books.  Is there a more egregious audiobook flaw than to have the same performer radically change voices for characters across volumes?,,I wondered how this could happen.  Looking back over the audible.com descriptions, I see the first 3 books were published by Books On Tape with Random House audio while books 4 (narrator change!?) and 5 (return of Dotrice but no voice / character continuity) were Random House only.,,I give book 5 4 stars for story but only 1 star for shabby audiobook direction/production.  I think Dotrice is a fine reader but the change in character voices is unforgivable.  If I was in charge I would have Books On Tape re-record books 4 and 5 with Dotrice as narrator but make sure the director takes care to maintain voice / character continuity.,,I previously PRAISED Roy Dotrice's performance of the books in this series. I struggled through the defeating sludge of uninspired data that made up most of A Feast For Crows, just to get back to the story- and BACK TO ROY DOTRICE.  What a catastrophe. How can an actor of his magnitude think that a fourteen year old beautiful willful queen should sound like a lowborn troll? This is not the Denaris Stormborn of three books past. WHAT HAPPENED ROY?  Unfortunately, the narrator's reading of the female voices so vital to this story have made this book IRRITATING rather than pleasurable to listen to. What a way to kill what once was a such a good thing.   Women should not sound like old men. Wassup Random House?????? Is nobody listening?,Yes, Dotrice is much better than the guy from the previous book. But Daeneyrs is my favorite character, I have been waiting 10 years to find out what's happening with her and her chapters are ruined by the old crone strange accent that Dotrice is suddenly using! It's wrecking this book for me. You may be less sensitive, but be warned. Did no one on the production side listen to this to hear the jarring change in voice of such a major character?,I agree with other reviewers who point out that Roy Dotrice, who was so excellent in the first 3 books ruins the reading here by changing the voices of Daenerys and Mellesandre. This is especially noticeable with Dany who is such a central character. She is supposed to be a young, royal woman but now sounds like an old serving wench. I can't fathom the change. I've so enjoyed listening to this series, but I don't know if I can make it through this one. I love hearing the old Tyrian again, but I find myself wanting to turn this off anytime Dany speaks. What happened here?,Let's get the important stuff out of the way. Writing? As good as the rest. Narrator? Read the other reviews. Should you get it? It's not like you won't. What's the problem then?,,The problem is that nothing happens in this book, even (unbelievably) less than in the last one. I understand that Martin wanted to skip ahead in time and deal with everything in flashbacks, but he wrote this book instead, a book of not-flashback folderol. At best, it is an engaging slog. The first three books were full of movement, literally. People went places and killed people, often as part of giant armies. Then all of a sudden, everyone decides to sit around for a while, twiddling their thumbs, remembering times past and talking talking talking. There are a few armies in this book, and one of them does manage to move for a while before stopping to have a nice chat. Only Tyrion and Victarion actually bother to pick their feet up and go, and they're the best bits. Jaime and Davos get about two chapters of movement, just enough to remind us that they're awesome before vanishing off to get ready to do of something interesting in the next book, presumably. Some new characters appear out of nowhere and take the time to tell us their names. Daenerys sits around worrying over logistics, marriages, food, and the meaning of leadership. Jon sits around worrying over logistics, marriages, food, and the meaning of leadership. Asha and Ser Barristan do much the same, although mildly less insufferably. Only Theon's story truly kicks ass in this book, and boy does it. I actually started to get annoyed at each new Jon chapter. Each one was an hour of blather and petty bickering. By the end I was hoping he would die like his boring old dad. Arya turns up again, still with the mysterious dudes who don't bother to say anything that might hint of a plot. Cersei turns up again, to feel sorry for herself some more. All of this might be bearable if we could expect the next book any time soon. I don't.,A Song of Ice and Fire is my ""most favorite"" Audible series (member for over 10 years), but I was actually disappointed in this audio book.  For the most part, it was probably the narration by Roy Dotrice that ruined it for me.  Mr. Dotrice did a superb job narrating previous books and I remember being very upset that he stopped narrating the more recent ones.  So, I was thrilled to see that he had been brought back for this book.  Unfortunately, he was just not up to the task.  I had to listen very carefully when a chapter started to know who the characters were because each chapter had a nearly identical set of ""voices"".,,Daenerys (young dragon queen), was probably the worst voiced character.  She has a prominent role in this book, which made her voice all the more disappointing.  Instead of sounding like the most beautiful queen in the realm, she sounded like an old hag.  In fact, nearly all the females sounded old and haggy.  Nearly all the knights sounded the same as well.  But, at least you could always pick out any male from house Lannister because they all sounded like Tyrion :),,I am not trying to be mean here since I love the series and loved Roy Dotrice in the previous books he narrated.  I will have to say that George Martin went a little overboard with the number of characters in this book and perhaps that had something to do with the narration problems.  Also, this book did not have nearly the action and pacing of the previous books.  I find this is typical with writers who are trying to ""tie up"" all the loose ends in a series or just trying to do a good job of bringing things to a logical conclusion.  Then the last part of the last book is so full of action and pace that you can't put it down and find yourself wishing the writer had done a better job of spacing the pacing (so to speak).,,Perhaps George Martin is now such a mainstream success that his editors were afraid to touch the script... I mean book.  Please, please, please, Mr. Martin, Mr. Dotrice, and ""editors"", return to the style of the earlier books for Book 6 and you will have my undying appreciation!,this review will be about the audio performance and not concern the story itself.   I am delighted that we the audience were heard, and that Roy Dotrice has returned.  The audio performance of book 4 was a crime against fiction.,,But this performance is no where near as good as were the 1st 3 books and I am angered that no one involved in this production cared enough to make it better.  Was there no director?  Was Mr Dotrice given time enough to prepare?  Was this project not worth the bother of continuity?,I echo the criticisms of all the others who said that Dany's voice is terrible.  But also its much harder to tell the difference between the characters speaking and the thoughts they don't voice.  In previous books there was no question.   And some of the emotionality is just wrong.  For example, I don't think this is a spoiler, Jon thinks to himself that he must kill the boy inside himself to become a man.   But the thought "" kill the boy"" is delivered with a venomous rage that would be more appropriate were Jon thinking about Theon.   The depth and perception of the earlier work is betrayed here.,,its still way better than book 4,,One small mention of the writing itself - this book is coarser in a lot  of ways and made even more so by lots of chatter about bodily functions and elimination behaviors.   That the narrative has been peppered with  references like this all along has never bothered me, but this one has too much.  Its cheap.,,I can't help but think they didnt give it enough time  or perhaps they just see the audio as income and not as at artform with intrinsic value.   Its such a pity.  I feel like Christmas was cancelled this year,While I disliked having to wait five years for A Dance with Dragons as much as anyone else, I wasn‚Äôt too disappointed with the experience of reading it. In fact, I was thrilled just to be immersed in George R.R. Martin‚Äôs gritty, living world again, and to revisit my favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Daenyrs, and a few others) and locations. I couldn‚Äôt put down the audiobook (well, the device containing it).,The first three books were tough acts to follow, and Martin can be partially forgiven for falling a little short on books four and five. However, the chorus of frustration from fans isn‚Äôt without merit. Martin kind of painted himself into a corner back in 2004, when he realized that the book he was writing had gotten too long. Rather than edit it down to a more manageable size, he split it in two. A Feast for Crows wound up being an immense novel of in which lots of hitherto minor characters got placed into new intrigues, along with some new characters. Was there was a larger purpose to these minor adventures? Or had the author just gotten swallowed in his own world, convinced that what the reader really wanted on this bus tour through Westeros was more stops, with no roadside stand or historic marker not worth a visit? (Hey, it worked for Patrick Rothfuss.),A Dance with Dragons doesn‚Äôt really resolve those questions, but at least we get the major characters back, and the things eventually start to pick up steam and head somewhere. Tyrion hitchhikes his way east by a few less-than-ideal arrangements. Jon Snow tries to do his duty while dealing with the conflicting demands of an impatient king. And Theon Greyjoy makes a return, in *very* changed circumstances. As always, the ‚Äúliving, breathing‚Äù world remains brilliantly vibrant and alive, its drama infecting everything that happens in the foreground. For example, there‚Äôs one sequence in which soldiers are sent on a dreadfully misplanned winter mission, not unlike Napoleon‚Äôs troops in Russia. While this sequence could have been shorter, the details of cold, starving, weary men were so vivid, I didn‚Äôt really care -- I was just along for the ride. And the chapters with Daenrys in Myreen illustrate the difficulties of ruling a ‚Äúliberated‚Äù land in a way that seems not unfamiliar. By the time the dragons in the story finally come into their own, we‚Äôre feeling as ready for it as she is.,I agree with a few other reader complaints. Martin has slipped into the bad habit of repeating catchphrases (‚Äúwords are wind‚Äù, ‚Äúmy name is Reek...‚Äù) and important pieces of information multiple times, from multiple angles, rather than trusting readers to see the connections themselves. The new characters he introduces aren‚Äôt terribly interesting, and there‚Äôs little tension (for now) over the possibility that our old favorites will die, as they have in the past. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a little more exploration of strange and wondrous things (e.g. the ruins of Valyria).,On the audiobook experience, I had very mixed feelings. Overall, Roy Dotrice‚Äôs grandfatherly tones are a great fit for Martin‚Äôs writing, but, to my ears, he gets some voices horribly wrong. Young women sound like old hags or Monty Python members in drag. Too many knights sound like Long John Silver, and Tyrion could be a leprechaun. For the first hours, I was tempted to give up and get the print edition, but, luckily, my ears adapted. In general, I‚Äôm pretty tolerant of less-than-perfect readers for audiobooks -- your mileage may vary.,Yet, all that said, I remained hooked on the series, and even a flawed entry is one I can‚Äôt put down. Martin has tested us with two long novels of buildup, buildup, and more buildup, but I remain hopeful that the tour bus will be getting back on the highway and heading towards the big destinations that his fans signed on for.,This is the fifth book in the series, if you have not read them do not start here. This is the best Fantasy series being written today, so go to book one and enjoy.,For those that have read the earlier ones, I placed this third in the series of what I liked. Book 3 was the best then book 1. This is a character driven series and has some of the best characters of any series written. The book starts with Tyrion who is my favorite of all characters of all books. Tyrion is as witty or more so in this book, unfortunately he is about the only main character who does anything and even his character does not seem to have a purpose. There is no plot to this book, it just a tie-up of what each character is thinking. With the exception of Tyrion and Reek, everything else is just Wind. The exploits of Tyrion and Reek make this book worth the credits and 49 hours of listening. Reek is kind of a new character, you have to read the book to find out what I mean.,Daenerys and Jon two good characters are featured in this, but they don't do anything until the very end. Samwell is sent away early in the book, so has no impact. Arya and Bran are in this fleetingly, but are interesting when they are. Asha Greyjoy has a couple of good chapters. Cersei has a good chapter toward the end. We get to know Ser Barristan Selmy a little more in this book. Penny is a new character that could be interesting. There is some here on Sellswords and Free Companies, but I found them mostly a distraction.,G.R.R. M. likes to remind us that words are wind and there is a lot of wind in this. A lot of talk about things that happened hundreds to thousands of years ago. There is a lot of talk about who is related to who, etc. Boring stuff I wish GM would quit forcing on to us.,About the narrator. This is the first book of the series that I have listened to. I understand that this was a hard one to read with the dozens of characters that are in it. But I believe it to be a crime to screw up, one of the main characters and the butchery that the narrator does to poor Daenerys is unforgivable. She is supposed to be a young beautiful queen. (Check out her looks in the HBO series, which if you have not watched you should) The narrator makes her sound like a granny from the Ozarks. There were times when I not only was confused on which character was talking, but I could not even tell what gender they were. I have listened to hundreds of audio books and this the worst butchery I have ever listened to.  All of the characters sound like they are over 70, with most of the men and some of the women sounding like pirates, I keep expecting him to end the sentences with RRRRR.,With all that being said, Martin at his worst his better then most writers at there best, so you want this book. You will want to become a part of these characters lives and you will thanks to Martin.,Roy Dotrice does only three voices in this series.,,1)  Old Irish Male         (All Male voices),2)  Old Irish Female     (All Female voices),3)  Leprechaun            (Children),,The Narration is extremely frustrating and ruins the experience for me.  One character to the next sounds as if they are 100 years old with strep throat.  HBO did a fantastic job and this is such a departure.  Don't waste your credits and buy the book instead."
The Secret,"Thriller & Suspense,War & Military,Military,Suspense",Literature & Fiction,"Counted the days for this release and needn‚Äôt have bothered. I miss Lee Child and Dick Hill. Maybe I‚Äôm being too harsh, but everything about this was aggravatingly disappointing.,,Watched this in my wish list for months waiting on the next installment.  Told everyone in the office to leave me alone because it was Jack Reacher day... 9 hours 14 mins later... ""Never downloading another one."",,First 1/3 of the book is a sub-plot but not really a sub-plot because it's just an entirely irrelevant tangent about another crime that does nothing to develop characters or plot.  Doesn't give any insights to people or events referenced later in his story line in previous books.  Doesn't tie into the main plot whatsoever.  Just ""here's a bunch of words about an uninteresting story so I can satisfy my quota to the publisher for this year's book.""  Insulting waste of time to legions of readers / listeners who pay for any book in this series.,,Main plot is at best a C generic crime fiction.  None of the Jack Reacher humor or wittiness we're looking for.  None of the twists and turns at which Lee was so great.  Just plodded along with people getting killed and entirely unbelievable fight scenes like a woman taking down 5 armed men because of her supernatural Israeli skills.  Predictable ending.,,I like Scott Brick, have listened to dozens of books he's narrated.  He's not the right voice for a Reacher book.  The over dramatic newsman thing just doesn't fit with Reacher's persona.,,Just downright disappointing.  Won't be giving any more of my hard earned dollars for Andrew to grift off Lee's acclaimed series while phoning-in this garbage.,First Jack Reacher audio book that does hold my attention- I keep rewinding and trying to follow along just to get through it. I‚Äôve gone back to the older stories for repeat listening but one time is all can take with this story.,Terrible. I get that it‚Äôs fiction, so if things are a little unbelievable that‚Äôs okay. This was ridiculous. Super ninja beats five armed guys waiting in ambush with kicks and punches. Stupid.,jack reacher is (was) a force of nature. this story barely has him participating. sad turn for a great character,I am a diehard Lee Child/jack reacher fan. But I‚Äôm going to see if I can return this audible book and buy it in book format. This narrator‚Äôs voice is beyond annoying. Nobody talks like this! Not even Reacher. It‚Äôs so over the top ridiculous. I feel like I‚Äôm listening to a movie from the 50s. Or an advertisement. Think Tony Curtis, in ‚ÄúSome like it hot‚Äù when he‚Äôs trying to be a millionaire. But with an aggressive voice. Yuck!,Chapter 6 and I am bored out of my mind. Story rambles worse than an old car.,I always enjoy a Reacher book.  However, there is an absence of the quirkiness that makes this character special. The story was uninspired and done without flair.  I miss Lee Child‚Äôs writing. And humor.,Love the reacher novels, but the last two books have been horrible. Wish I could return it. storyline on this one was horrible. Use of characters was horrible.,Andrew is not the correct author for this.  Massive shift for 3 books now.  Everyone notices it.  They should have done a different series about Joe or someone else in the Universe to allow for a different approach.  I have listened to most of this series a few times.  However, I won't be purchasing any more books after this one, unless Lee is the sole author.  Sad days."

Talk to Strangers,"Entertainment & Celebrities,Personal Success",Biographies & Memoirs,"Matts book for Yes Theory is a heartfelt narrative that resonates deeply with anyone looking to embrace life's uncertainties. His honest account of the ups and downs faced by the Yes Theory team is not just inspiring but incredibly humanizing. Reading about their challenges and triumphs, I felt a profound sense of connection and less alone in my own journey.,Matts vulnerability in sharing his fears and doubts adds an authentic touch, making the book more than just a story ‚Äì it's a companion in the journey towards saying 'yes' to life. It's a powerful reminder that stepping out of our comfort zones, despite the fears, can lead to building something extraordinary.,This book isn't just yes theory‚Äôs story; it felt like it was partly mine too, offering a blueprint for a more adventurous and meaningful life. It's a poignant, relatable guide for anyone seeking inspiration to make a change and feel less isolated in their aspirations.,Tbh I‚Äôve never actually listened to or followed a book or story with such a strong ability to under the emotion of the words of the author. I‚Äôve always been a black sheep, never really relating to anyone around me yet being able to fit in and relate to anyone around me. I had a very rocky childhood, very rocky adolescence and a very questioning life in general and in turn I was always a workaholic who found purpose solely in work‚Ä¶. Well that was until this year, listening/reading the story of Matt and the stories of the crew I‚Äôve watched for years on YouTube truly brought to light the truth that we all are human and that the presence we see on the screen is simply a 2D persona of the person we can‚Äôt truly see as 3D unless in person or listening/seeing them in person. I Just want to say bravo to everyone of you for making this far in life, no matter who you are, who you want to be, or what you want to become. You can do it! And people like those of the yes theory crew and people like me truly believe in you! Well worth the read and great job to all of you!,I found it best to take it slow,,Listen, pause and follow the friendship/Yes journey along with their Yes Theory YouTube/Podcast channel for the journey they've been through.,,Thank you for sharing your journey with us.,I'm halfway through the book, and I've hardly encountered any new content. The stories seem overly familiar from podcasts and other episodes. Matt's reading style, including the 'fake excitement' screams, is a bit rough on the ears. Additionally, the excessive cursing feels out of place. The writing itself lacks quality, and I don't feel connected to the storytelling as I do with the videos. I'm aware Matt has put a lot of effort into this book, so it's sad to write this.,As a Yes theory fan it was a privilege to get the ""BTS""-insight into the team and especially Matt who I relate to so much. I loved the story, the fact that he narrated it himself and I only wish it was even longer!,Being a fan of Yes Theory, I‚Äôve long awaited this book (since it was first announced that Matt was writing a book). Worth the wait 110%. Loved listening to the stories, but even more so, listening to this was so inspiring for my own journey. Highly recommend whether you‚Äôre familiar with Yes Theory or not.,The main character here, Matt, seems to have found a lucky horse shoe and wants nothing more to destroy his progress every chance he gets. His friends, especially Thomas, seem to be the true driver of Yes Theory and their success. This book gets a thumbs sideways at best.,matt has such a great voice for audio books.,that being said it was wonderful to hear the origin  story. and it is a comfort to know that someone like Matt struggles to know their place in life when it seems like he knew.

I wanted more, more of the strength, love, and hardships.,Just writing one more review as I just finished this. That was amazing, Matt and Derin!,,Part 4 was beautifully written and my favorite. The story of Yes Theory from Matt's perspective was cool to experience. I had fun remembering moments I got to witness as a Youtube viewer throughout part 2 and 3.,,I think if you don't normally read books, the audiobook is the best way to go. Matt beautifully narrates the story and you can feel his energy at the impactful parts. I was tearing up during Part 4.,,Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this part of your life with us. I hope the next chapter of your life is peaceful, beautiful, and true to what you want to do :),What a great book! I‚Äôve been watching Yes Theory for a few years now and have been so inspired by the channel. Matt is so open and honest in this book it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air. Definitely one I will listen to over and over again!,Absolutely love that these guys practice what they teach. Buy the book for yourself, then buy it for friends and family.,What a great book.

Preceptor,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Paranormal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This book is terrific.  The only negative is that it was too short.  I would really appreciate it if the author would go back to his original format of 30 hour long books, rather than 20 hour long books with a 10 hour long novella between each major book release.  I can only imagine the point of the change was to maximize revenue by splitting what should be the material for one great book into two books.  Unfortunately, we don't benefit from this format.  In fact, having the material split into two books detracts from the story.  The first 10 or so books in the series each seemed longer and had more content, and content from multiple characters' perspectives.  Now it seems like each book is getting split into multiple books where we only get one characters' perspective in each.  The main books are still terrific.  But the novellas suffer since the secondary characters' perspectives aren't really enough to justify an entire book.  So the novellas aren't nearly as satisfying.  Indeed, some aren't really worth purchasing for the minimal content they include.,,Terry, I'd appreciate it greatly if you'd consider reverting to your original methodology and forget about having a .5 version between every major release.  That's not to say that the novellas aren't good.  Many of them are good, mostly because they're anthologies, or because they are truly content that warrants a separate entry in the series.  I'm just opposed to artificially splitting the content that ought to be released as one long but very good book into two for the purpose of selling more books.,,Okay, on to the review!  Terry is incredibly good at creating characters you can appreciate, admire, cheer on, and support.  Even after 16 plus books, Minalin is still a crafty devil who almost never puts a foot wrong, despite being responsible for the wellbeing of an entire world.  Terry's ability to continue to write this story is impressive.  Terry is still coming up with twists and surprises, challenges and tribulations, and his characters manage to come up with fresh clever solutions.  This is no easy feat considering how many times the world has been faced with destruction thanks to this goblin horde, this undead king, or that foolish mortal ruler.  Keeping the story engrossing and fresh has to be the most impressive thing that Terry is doing with this series.  I've read almost every sci-fi series written in the past 20 years, and there are precious few authors who could do as much.,,There is a lot of detail, lots of clever strategy, lots of seat-of-the-pants best-guessing.  But however they manage to pull off the save, our beloved heroes always seem to pull their butts out of the fire, while also sticking it to the bad guys far more thoroughly and cleverly than anyone has a right to expect.,,It's a detailed world, with realistic characters, deep politics, and variety of all types.  And still Terry continues to grow the story.  Much like Robert Jordan used to do, each of Terry's books seem to broaden the scope of what the hero is facing.  Instead of wrapping up plot-lines, Terry just continues to create new ones and add them into his overarching plot.  But he doesn't get lost.  It's all very well thought out, with few to no inconsistencies.,,Please keep the books coming!  I for one will be excitedly waiting for the next one!,Listen this series isn‚Äôt going to be for everyone. It‚Äôs world building in real detail and not the nonsense ways some other series throw around the concept. That means is can be slow but for those like me who are as interested in why a geographic area chooses to farm a particular animal or crop as much as they are in the history and culture, there isn‚Äôt anything else like it. The story in the entry is a rush of details and plot points coming to an end only to open new ones. Ones you didn‚Äôt expect but make sense given everything else. I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough. But ask yourself if you want to read about a detailed  about how to build and feed an army as much as you want to hear the battles they fight. If you do, please read this series.,I‚Äôm relatively new to the world of Minalin the Spellmonger, and finished Marshal Arcane for the first time about four weeks before this book‚Äôs release. I feel like this installment encompasses everything I love about this series so much‚Äî it has elements of the world-building we saw in Magelord, a medium-length (medium for Terry Mancour, that is) battle where a lot of unexpected events occurred, a LOT of intrigue and diplomatic tension, as well some fascinating (and highly entertaining) exercises for the Four rulers-in-training Min (grudgingly) agrees to instruct!,This book struck me as more polished and put together than some of the previous volumes. There were far less spelling/pronunciation errors and fewer incorrect timeline details than have been present in past books (lookin‚Äô at you, Necromancer!),It just felt like peak Spellmonger to me! I have zero complaints. Whatever audio issue was plaguing the recording of Marshal Arcane is gone‚Äî and John Lee brings this book to life with his usual flair and dedication.,The series is entering a new and fascinating phase‚Äî and I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,,The story is great, but dang does it move slow. It moves in a lot of directions very inefficiently.,The plot line that follows Min tutoring the young royals was glossed over while still barely progressing.,The main plot line on Min‚Äôs plan to save the world barely progressed from where the last book ended.,The plot line concerning the Korbal and Sherule was just a single battle with only allusions to the resulting aftermath.,Honestly, this book was about 23 hours long, but it could have been half that if there had been good editing.,Bravo! This has been worth the wait (but I still need more). Just enough action. just enough intrigue. Spatterings of education and explanations. Continuation of marvelous story lines.,Terry Mancour has written of the best and most creative worlds, and is in league with Tolkien, Asimov, and Robert Jorden. I long for each new release and fear something will happen and there will never be one. It's so deliciously vexing!,Another quality work and continuation of the story. I can't wait for the next book!,I love these series and I'm always excited for a new one. My only complaint was that it seemed to end in an odd place. It feels like a longer story that got chopped in two. When I heard ""epilog""... I checked my app because I thought I'd accidently skipped some chapters. it's as if this book set up alot of things: orb changes; nephew issues; God issues; Garetth, sentient trees; the lady at the end; etc. etc. etc. then just moved on. Of course sometimes we need these bridge books so the next one is even better... and maybe I'm just being greedy as I never want them to end.,Still love this series but the last two books have been a lot of explaining from Minalan. Not as entertaining as the other books and not a lot of quality interactions or plots with other characters.,Another great book in the series from my favorite author. I have read every book on the series and enjoyed them all,Great story. Great intrigue. Great characters. Great narration. The author is so good at character development, and there are so many characters to love and hate!  I just need more!!!!!,Really love this books series. I am always recommending it‚Äôs the story that just keeps giving,fun smoothly actioned book. one of those reads you can really relax to, and have a bit of fun listening to.,there are a good few ways the story could continue from here excited to see which direction it's headed,love the series, struggling a little to remember all of the ever expanding cast and the order of the books released now but would still heartily recommend!,This is book 16 and I'm not counting the spin offs and inbetweeny books.  Keeping it interesting, fresh and moving the story along without just shoving a quick end on something must be hard as it rarely occurs.,This book is a stand out in an already stand out series.  There is action, some small political intrigue, plot progression and the occasional twist and turn. This is the type of instalment with very few lulls or prolonged period of introspection from the main character. I usually listen on my commute or in bed and I always felt annoyed when I had to stop., it is the audio version of a real page turner.  It's difficult to be specific without giving spoilers so I won't.  What I will say is that anyone who likes the series will probably regard this as one of the best if not THE best instalment so far and that is no small thing.,once again another brilliant book. John Lee does amazing work.,If I had one complaint it's that it wasn't long enough. I didn't want it to end.,There‚Äôs so much in this book I had to listen to it twice before I felt I had heard it properly.,A great read with brilliant narration it drives the story forward into unknown depths.,i cant get enough of this whole series, the world, the magik, the characters. i have never been this invested in a series before and will now re start from the beginning for the 3rd time!!,This one felt very much a series reset - tied up lots of ongoing plot lines but didn‚Äôt really start anything new.,However the intermissions are hilarious!,This one was perfectly executed. Exactly what I‚Äôve been waiting for my only complaint is that i got through it so quickly. Shame on me‚Ä¶,,I love this series. The plot twists and turns throughout and this book does not disappoint.,I love this series of books and there has been so many different lines. I‚Äôve just spread like a spiderweb through all of them. Finally, we are catching up on progress on where everything is at, and even adding some more to the mix temporarily closing off others. I really appreciate the thought that goes into this series.,I love Spellmonger, but it feels like this one got stuffed with filler. Even the major struggle with Korbal felt rushed and then we get distracted with Tavard and a looming Ferese campaign. I thought we were on the path of the mad wizard, to save the world but lose the war.,Honestly one of my favourite series I've experienced in the past few years. The characters are well fleshed out, the plot engaging and Mancour manages to balance the intrigue of the minor plots(wars, relationships etc) with the overarching ending that is probably not far away. Awaiting the next with baited breath.,Loved the entire book, start to finish.,Couldn't help but feel pity for Blockhead üòï,,Unbelievably amazing, fabulous story, had me hooked from begin to end. This is my favourite series of all time. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book."
Torrent Witches Cozy Mysteries Complete Box Set: Books 1-10,"Short Stories,Occult,Cozy,Cozy Mysteries",Literature & Fiction,"a good listen, however this boxset is frustrating because the books are not separated. there's over 250 chapters and no way to tell where one book begins or ends.,I really enjoyed the story.  Natalie does such an amazing job.  She brings warmth and life to the characters..  I could easily listen to another 20 books on the Torrent family of witches and their mischief.  That being said I could really do without the constant focus on the witches weight.  Descriptive is great but it almost felt a little body shamey and I feel like we should be evolving .   A persons weight shouldn‚Äôt be such a focus in a source of entertainment.  Weight was brought up in a less than positive light on multiple instances. You alienate a part of your audience in doing so.  I guess if that doesn‚Äôt bother you as an author then it shouldn‚Äôt bother me..  I will say it might make me think twice about ordering another book from Tess Lake though..  We should try to do better shouldn‚Äôt we?,Basically this author took the Amanda M Lee - Winchester witchs of the midwest and changed the names....and thats about it.   The story setup is nearly identical.  Main char is a reporter returned home.   cousins, bnb, crazy anut...so many other similarities down to the aunts antics to not be over looked.  I cant list all of the sameness here but even the language nuances are the same...the interplay of the family is the same too....its like a shadow of an original.  The narrator is good I would listen to her stuff again for sure.,I'm really enjoying it (book one) but the end of chapter 14 in book one is missing.  I've tried all kinds of things to ""find"" it. It is just not there.  Makes  me wonder what else is missing but not obvious enough to notice.,What at first appeared to be a charming little cozy mystery grew to a heartfelt series with more in depth meaning behind it. I would definitely recommend listening to these books, especially for those of you who loved watching charmed (the original 90s one), and Sabrina the teenage witch (also the 90s one).,,This is a complete ripoff of Amanda M. Lee Winchester Witch series‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm shocked this is out there,I really like the series so far. But in the First book, chapter 14, the audio ends in the middle of a sentence and then chapter 15 starts and clearly there's a scene cut out at the end of chapter 14. I don't know if the Audible people read these reviews, but just letting them know about the audio issue.,enjoyed these books very much.  good character development.  might hearted with some romance and witchy fun,This is an entertaining set of books to listen to.  They are light hearted and smile evoking.  Realize this is in the Cozy Mystery genre therefor there will be similarities in tone to the many others in this category.  The Narrator infused the story with a variety of tones and vocal inflections which made each character differ from each other,  The set is addicting and caused sorrow when they came to an end.  I look forward to more being written and will purchase each one when they do!,I purchased this set on a lark, never having read Tess Lake's books, and I am so glad I did. I binge the entire set, books 1-10, and I still want more. Harlow, Kiera, Molly, Luce, Peda, the moms, Aunt Cass, Hattie, Jack, and the others are such amazing characters. I do hope you write that cave scene one day, Tessa.,I had very little or no idea if I'd like these books or not because whilst I've occasionally listened to a few Paranormal and Dragony stories I predominantly listen top Sci-fi.,These books are so easy to enjoy with what I can best describe as No Heavy Duty stuff.,I honestly didn't want them to finish and I have no doubt I'll listen to them many times.,My only albeit minor criticism is my usual annoyance at the way Americans mispronounce and generally screw up the English Language (The pronunciation of as an example Narrator and the past tense of Leaped which maybe spelt Leapt but actually pronounced 'Lept' to name just a couple).,No worries, hopefully Tess Lake will write more of these wonderful books and Natalie Duke is far far better than many Narrators.,,Since I listened to these excellent Stories I've listened to a couple more within the same genre and without question Tess Lake stands out even more as a brilliant author and makes her stories even more of a pleasure to listen to time and again.,Very well written and performed. Love how everything tied together. Characters were well written.  This will definitely stay in my library as a ""safe read"".,Easy listening, great story, fab narration. Great background book to make chores more interesting,Loved this series. Highly recommend. Narration was excellent and definitely one of my favourite listens.,There is a good story line threw out the whole story and follows on through each book.,Well told and even makes you laugh in parts . Loved every book and will listen to them again,Funny, enticing, and moreish.  I'm sad that I have finished the series, I think this would make an excellent tv show... come on CW!,What a series!! 10 books doesn‚Äôt feel enough, the story lines and plot twists are refreshing and it‚Äôs been an absolute delight to listen too, also with the same narrator throughout which is brilliantly consistent she captures the characters perfectly.,Everything came together in the later books.. Book 10 was fascinating.,In book 1 it was somewhat confusing, with another series regarding 3 young witches with a Great Aunt.,An easy listen with enjoyable characters and a rather clever story arc. Characters are interesting although a little shallow or one dimensional at times. I found this didn't matter too much as overall it was well written and it's supposed to be light reading/listening which is exactly what I was looking for.,I would happily listen to the narrator again despite her being American (I often find American intonation and speech patterns in narration unbearable being English, while persistent alternate pronunciations can be incredibly irritating). Her characterisations were clear and consistent and she was a good choice for the series. She is an excellent storyteller and the author had a good story for her to tell.,I like some easy listening cosy crime to do housework to and have a pretty low bar, but this was truly terrible. Badly written, confusing plot and very dull. Don‚Äôt go there.,10 books that take you on an adventure full of love, magic and mayhem  with a wide range of great characters brought to life by the talented Natalie Duke. Listrners ride a roller coaster of emotions with twists and turns that will make you stay up all night to see what happens. 5 worthy stars. Well done Tess Lake,Well worth listening to the complete series. Easy reading, pick it up and put it down anytime and still know what the story was about,Loved the characters, my daughter loved adams so much. Great series, I‚Äôm so sad I haven‚Äôt found one quite like it,This set of books really got me in. I loved, loved, loved it. The characters were realistic, witch mothers treating their mid 20s girls like teenagers, an 80 yr old aunt acting like a young person. Mystery, murder, falling in love you have it all. Once started I couldn't turn it off unless I really had to. Listened all day and then when I went to bed. Well done Tess look forward to more of your books,I love the stories and meaning behind them. The narrator is easy to listen to. There is nothing like witchery, comedy and mystery.,The story was fantastic, perfect characters and an adorable speaking cat. Adams was definitely my favourite! Also perfect moments!,I had a great time listening to this set, great performance and totally worth the listen. Thank you Tess Lake.,Thank you so very much Tess Lake I totally love these 10 books it's a shame I have finished them fingers Crossed you will right several more story's about the Torrent witches üíúüíúüíúüíú,I got completely sucked in to the story.  The family is wonderful and I want to be friends with all of them,This is such a lovely series that drew me in from the start and it's just so amazing to be able to listen and know that you'll have all the answers by the end because it's completed. If you're wondering if it's worth the credit - it definitely is!! It's cozy and sweet but also is so well crafted that there were so many unexpected twists and turns. Each book has a small mystery while an overall mystery sits behind the whole series that builds up and is revealed at the end, and it's just such a great listen! The narrator is also amazing, and I loved listening to the engaging way she tells the story and the different voices (especially Adams!!). 10/10 recommend :)"
Mark of the Fool 4,"Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic,Cyberpunk",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This is a perfect next step, and it‚Äôs nice to see the story returning to the main storyline after book 2 was more focused on filling, and the main characters developing their skills.,,The only series that beats this one out for me is ""He who fights with monsters"".,I like the world building and the story the most. This world does not follow a system. Its more a Harry Potter world where you either have magic or not. If you have magic, then it is up to the person to learn and grow their own ability.,I like the story. No angst, no whiney mc.,This is a good one. Give it a whirl.,Book one of this Audible series was great, I keep hoping the other books will pretty much be as good as the first one. unfortunately the rest of them have been disappointment. Travis Baldree it‚Äôs the biggest selling point this audible book series. Take him out of the equation, its just an average audiobook series.,,To me, this is the weakest of the series so far. Two stars for story. It‚Äôs not horrible, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ Typical, standard, a clone. I just found it so slow and lots of ‚Äúbatman‚Äù like hypotheses like ‚ÄúWell if A = B, then B = C, and if B = C‚Ä¶ the Joker is going to fill town hall with laughing gas as a distraction so that Bane can break into the lab and steal Mr. Freeze‚Äôs gun!‚Äù It just feels like a bunch of exposition in the form of the MC and his mentor having leading conversations that tell the reader exactly what to think.,I don‚Äôt know if anyone else caught this, but it seemed like the author went out of his way to explain how muscular the MC was becoming, especially compared to how skinny he was when he started his journey. I mean it comes up many times in the novel with multiple instances of ‚Äúold friend‚Äù type characters saying things like ‚ÄúWow! You look like you‚Äôve been working out!‚Äù Alex then flexed his bulging muscles and smiled. ‚ÄúYep! A LOT!‚Äù There is literally a whole chapter talking about how the MC went from benching 300 lbs to 2000 lbs in a matter of days. No explanation of any real motivation to do so, and the reason he is able to do it is just ‚ÄúMagic!‚Äù,There‚Äôs also this weird sexual tension between the MC and his girlfriend. There‚Äôs some implication that they have been doing the deed, but it‚Äôs kinda written like someone who‚Äôs only heard that adults do secret things behind closed doors. No need for long drawn out scenes, but it just feels weird. (I get it, it‚Äôs young adult fiction),The author also consistently throws in references to our real world media and it just takes me out of the experience a little bit. One line is ‚ÄúDo you know what happens when a toad is struck by lightning? The same thing as everything else‚Äù - A direct line borrowed / stolen from the first X-Men movie. Some references to Star Wars, Cradle, and I think even Family Guy. It was off-putting.,Meh, at least it‚Äôs Baldree, so it‚Äôs decent voice acting, but I think I‚Äôm losing interest in the series. I hate to abandon a series midway though, but unless book 5 is amazing, I think I‚Äôm done.,Great story, great characters, would love for it to finish the series faster and not be 8 books,,Both the story and the narrator are great! Story is a natural development from the previous book and the narrator did an excellent job in being consistent throughout the story with the voices used for the stories characters,I love this series! So glad to have found it! Also I love Travis Baldree.,Everyone here has already listened to books 1-3 so we all like the books :) I'm just glad this one had a nice progression and didn't end abruptly like some other book 2+ series.,This book was awesome and I suggest everyone listen to it. It is awesome.,I‚Äôm going to need you to keep writing.  These books are well written and the narration is on point.  For the love of Aldur do not change the narrator which has ruined other series.,I‚Äôll be following this series to its end, which I hope isn‚Äôt anytime soon.,i liked the pacing in the story and good crafted story.,The only thing is i whanted more of it, the ending was a litel boring. I whant more books,,I love it. I love that the series keeps a progression fantasy vibe while not having overly present status windows, skills, and other tropes (this and The Hedge Wizard are both great at this), `The power system is still great and a far better take on the unwanted power trend. Also, when a series doesn't slouch on the slice of life aspect and manages to show the main character learning and growing, it is a brilliant thing. I genuinely enjoy listening to these books, and I only gave the story a 4 because while it was fantastically written (no overly repetitive words and fantasy terms) the series' story itself wasn't very prevalent until the end - though it is much better like this than being rushed. Mr Baldree did a brilliant job as always, he's probably my favourite narrator (with Heath Miller) and I am amazed how he keeps such clear distinction with both the characters in this series and in others, like The Primal Hunter. Bailyn (am I spelling that right?) is one of the most entertaining characters I have had the privilege of listening to, and the humour of each character was tasteful and not pushy. Definitely one of the best series I have read or listened to, and I can't wait for the next instalment.,,P.S.,I never really notice the litRPG elements, as it is a wonderful story on it's own with much less game-like tropes than other's of the 'genre', which makes it feel far more unique and well written, and more like a proper story.,This series is amazing, and book 4 is the 4'th success in the series! üòÅ,Great story, amazing characters, fantastic narration! Doesn't get much better! üôÇ,The series continued in the same progressive style and pace as its predecessors with an epic battle that pushed our hero to his limit. I listened to this far to quickly as I could stop listening. I hope this story continues and I can wait to read more...,Each book got better and better, now I can‚Äôt wait for the next book in the series.,Love this series, book 4 was better than 3, great progression and story development. Travis is awesome as always,Absolutely loved this edition to the series, the character developments and interactions makes me look forward to more in the series just wished it could've been longer.,At the end it felt like the story had finally warmed up and the real meat of the tale was going to begin. Alas that‚Äôs where the book ends. Nothing pivotal happens nor did any event have anything real at stake. No dire consequences, no no-way-back choices to make or anything that helped the bigger overarching story move along. The previous installment set us up for a whole bunch of super interesting avenues and plots. None of which were truly explored or furthered significantly whatsoever. Even the slice of life parts felt shallow. Not a bad book and most of it is absolutely saved by Travis performance.  But for the 19hrs it asks of you, it really under delivers. It felt like a book that has been cut in two parts and this was the introductory half of it.,yeah Alex is OP. in a league of his own. this unlike other books in the series purely focuses on the development of the MC. He's a badass.,Honestly really like it frankly I want the next book already maybe a little more progress needed but that also might be my need for more.,One thing that I love about this author, is that most of the cliffhangers occur at the end of each chapter. At the end of each book I feel satisfied and not desperately yearning for the next one. This isn't a bad thing, it's like enjoying the thrill of a new adventure l, but not being in pain when it's over lol. Also, nothing really brings a book together like Travis' narration. Keep it up guys!,Hurry up with mark of the fool 5 audio book. Loved the story, loved the characters and the voice actor was on point,Great books totally absorbed into the storyline.,I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!!! One of my fav narrators!,It's rare that I am enjoying a series more and more as it progresses, but this one is building upon the previous books we'll and the satisfaction of seeing the characters grow and the situations change is thoughly enjoyable!,Such a good storyline and so much packed into this book! It‚Äôs definitely the best yet and I‚Äôm already waiting for book 5! Hopefully the wait won‚Äôt be too long.,This instalment of the series made a really good series go to great!,Now I just need to wait for the next one because I can‚Äôt wait üòÜ,One of the best progression stories out there. I‚Äôm tempted to relisten to the whole series, soo good.,The story turns full circle back to where it started but now instead of struggling against 1 minion, our hero is ready to challenge the big boys of The Ravener‚Äôs army.,Really enjoyed this addition to the story after being disappointed with the 3rd book because they delayed Alex‚Äôs Thameland return.,this book had big things to live up to after the first 3 books and it didn't disappoint, I love the creativity in the characters personalitys,with a good dose of humor and battle paired with travis's narration makes for an amazing listen . Definitely recommend,loved it action packed great power navigation and explanation the story is progressing nicely and im very excited for book 5"
Tempted,Paranormal,Romance,"Love this series ! Can't wait for the next one. Narrator does a wonderful job. You can't go wrong with these two authors.,This series is one of my go to for re-reading and this novel is the same I love how it has a great storyline and depth, humour and passion the narrative could be better with a different person I think she just hasn‚Äôt got it for male narration but still a worthy book"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Book 3","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"I was so excited to hear that Audible got the rights to Harry Potter.  My introduction to audio books began with Harry Potter. Jim Dale's voice and delivery  brought to life characters that J. K.  Rowling created on paper.  Very few books have given me driveway moments,  minutes spent listening to the end of a chapter,  long after arriving home.,Thank you again to all for providing me an escape from the real world of muggles.,good book, nice to go back and relive my childhood, but the reader pronounces Voldemort ""voldemore"" through out the book and it annoyed me greatly.,What made the experience of listening to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Book 3 the most enjoyable?,Jim Dale's character voices.,What other book might you compare Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Book 3 to and why?,No comparison period.,What about Jim Dale‚Äôs performance did you like?,I like the tone of his voice; I feel like this is the movie version but better.,If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?,Starring Jim Dale as Everyone!,Any additional comments?,Audible, even though I love that you have added Harry Potter to your list of books I am also upset that each chapter of every Harry Potter book is missing it's chapter title which ruins the experience of this wonderful story but it is also disrespectful to J.K. Rowling and the art form of writing to totally disregard what Rowling wrote. If Rowling wanted the chapters to just be numbered she could have easily done that; she didn't; she named every chapter; the chapter titles enhance the experience not just an after thought. They are also functional because I may not always use the bookmarks or remember the number of the chapter I left off at. Often times I spot the chapters name and immediately know where I am in the story. You are the only app that I know of that doesn't include the chapter titles in there app. Please change your app to include the chapter titles for all digital audiobooks you sell.,Story:  The story continues... and gets even better!  As I mentioned in my review of Chamber of Secrets, it becomes more and more clear how J.K. Rowling brilliantly created the world of Harry Potter.  The characters continue to develop, new characters add to the story and the world continues to unfold in every book.  The story seems to flow effortlessly from one book to the next.  My favorite part of this particular book that was omitted from the movies and I didn't know about until now... The Marauders.  I knew of the map, sure, but the amount of detail, backstory, everything about the Marauders added so much more to this book than I thought possible.,Performance:  Gosh, once again the performance is stellar!  I feel as though Jim Dale is really engaging with the characters and therefore is able to capture them quite well.  I gave this a four star again because of this audio issue - the audio pauses for a few seconds making me think there is an error with the audiobook (starting to think I'm the only one with this issue).  That said, the narration itself is performed wonderfully!,Overall:  Seriously, how do these books get better and better?!  One thing I failed to mention on the previous two books is just how much better the books are compared to the movies (but when is that not the case?).  This is my first time reading / listening to this series, but still, I almost can't believe the amount of detail in the books that make them so much better and more enjoyable.  Prisoner of Azkaban doesn't disappoint!,I still wonder why Stphen Fry's narration of the series was not made available to US audiences. He is so much better. Dale's pronunciation of Harry's name by Hermione (Harreeeee) is so wrong. I don't care for his voicing of the female professors, either...they're all sputtering and sound like they've got a mouthful of jawbreakers.,To everyone complaining about how he pronounces Voldemort, please note that it is correct. The movies are incorrect, JK has stated this.,Otherwise, that is all this narrator does right. His voices are terrible, and they are constantly whining. Poor Hermione is the worst. HarrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeEEEEeeeeee!,Absolutely fantastic...  Jim Dale's character voices are perfect!  J K Rowling's  characters come to life.,We all need fantasy to turn to when reality closes in. The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Peter Pan and now Harry Potter lead the way. Any one of these does the trick for me.,The narrator was bothersome with drawn out and mispronounced words. I didn't seem to hear this on the first two books. Still I enjoyed it and will listen to this book again. Maybe just a matter of taste in narrators.,This is my favorite book of the series,But you won‚Äôt find a better narrator than Jim Dale,He is phenomenal truly.,Enjoy this book"
Freed,"Women's Fiction,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"We can officially say 50 shades story has 100% been fully exploited. There is a point with any series that the author needs to realize there is absolutely nothing left  of interest in the story to tell. I can summarize Grey‚Äôs 26 hr POV in Freed in two short sentences. We still screw kinky. I still make everyone around me suffer for my temper-tantrums.,There now you know the whole story and I saved you 26 hrs of your life you literally will never get back. The author added no extra character insight in this book that we didn‚Äôt already know clearly from the last books. There is no new information the adds or changes the readers understanding on the overall plot. The only thing that was added was Grey‚Äôs commentary on the kink in their sex life but again nothing that adds to the story that is already known.,Zachary Webber is the saving grace he is pleasant to listen to so you keep listening hoping the author eventually pulls some new and original content into the story line but FYI It never happens.,This book in general felt like the authors last attempt to squeeze the very last drops out of a popular series.,Skip it... your not missing a thing! I promise!,I'm so glad that freed from Christian pov is finally here. Loved every single second. Love Christian and Anna's romance story. These books made me fall in love with reading again,Book was good but Zachary Webber made it better. Wish Could find a different women to read the voice of Ana in Fifty Shades Series. I would have bought the whole audio series , like this one.  Instead of just 1 audiobook. Zachary brings  E.L. James great work to life!,A Colossal Book That Tells So Much More About The Couple‚Äôs Story. This Book Is A Deep & Emotional Read As Christian‚Äôs Character Digs Deeper To Overcome The Emotional Damage That Has Prevented Him From Living A Normal Life. Anastasia‚Äôs Safety Becomes An Obsession As He Recognizes That Her Life May Be In Danger. Yes, This Is A Steamy Story. Christian & Anastasia Have Incredible Chemistry & Those Scenes Burn Up The Pages. But They Also Serve To Bring The Couple Closer, & Due To Their Dark Nature, They Promote Trust & Deepen Intimacy. That Carries Over Into The Rest Of The Story ‚Äì And There Really Is A Story Here, Despite The Hype. The Characters Are Complex & Real, Even If The Story Itself Is A Fantasy. Christian May Be Dictatorial & Brash, But This Tells The Story Of A Boy & Teen Who Suffered From Abuse & Grew Into A Man Whose Self Worth Had Been Beaten Down.,,,ABOUT THE FIFTY SHADES AS TOLD BY CHRISTIAN SERIES:,,This book is absolutely a must read for fans. It is colossal ‚Äì and tells so much more than Anastasia‚Äôs story. A lot takes place here between the proposal and the wedding, which occurs one quarter of the way through the book. There are new scenes between Christian and his father, as readers finally get a look at their falling out before the wedding. Several scenes include Christian‚Äôs brother Elliot, and it is nice to see the two of them one on one. This book shows Anastasia making good on her promise to go to church. Elliot throws Christian a bachelor party to remember. This story pulls in more characters, and here we get to know how Christian feels about them all. From the changing relationship between him and his employees to Jose Rodriguez and Ethan Kavanagh. This book really adds to Christian and Anastasia‚Äôs story.,,Everyone is familiar with the Fifty Shades of Grey series. That is Anastasia Steele‚Äôs story. This is the third book in the series that tells the Fifty Shades of Grey story from the male point of view: this is Christian Grey‚Äôs story. Whether you have read the first series makes no difference here. It is essentially the same story, but here the reader gets to discover more about Christian, who is a far more fascinating character than Anastasia. Her story is captivating ‚Äì makes no mistake ‚Äì but hers is more of a dark coming of age story. Unlike Anastasia, Christian has a past ‚Äì one that is out of the ordinary in almost every respect. He has demons. Combined with the power he has amassed, that makes him dangerous, especially to someone like Anastasia. Anastasia‚Äôs story has her finding her own power and her own voice when she finds herself swept into a whirlwind relationship with a dark and powerful man. Christian‚Äôs story obviously goes further to shed light on what he is feeling throughout Anastasia‚Äôs story, and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Christian is a broken and misunderstood man who believes himself both incapable and undeserving of love until an unassuming college senior stumbles into his office and has him rethinking all the rules in his well-ordered world.,,Christian‚Äôs character is broken and compelling, and his story is well worth reading even if you already know Anastasia‚Äôs. This book picks up after Christian‚Äôs formal proposal at the tail end of his birthday party. For fans, book two in Anastasia‚Äôs story ended just a little after this story begins. This is a happy time for the couple, whose short relationship has seen big highs and lows.,,For the naysayers, just keep in mind while reading that this is a fantasy. There are certainly many happily married real-life couples that meet and marry in record-breaking time, and there are likewise real-life billionaires who are entitled to their own happy stories. There are also people that are healed by the love of someone special in their life. But this doesn‚Äôt pretend to be more than a fantasy ‚Äì a love story.,,Anastasia walking out on Christian in book one changed his life. It forced him to begin a process of earnestly confronting his demons and considering the possibility that he might be capable of a normal vanilla relationship. In book two, he began in earnest to win back her affections. He still has a lot to learn, however, as he works through the kinks (no pun intended).,,Yes, this is a steamy story. Christian and Anastasia have incredible chemistry and those scenes burn up the pages. Those scenes serve to bring the couple closer, and due to their dark nature, they serve to promote trust and deepen intimacy. That carries over into the rest of the story. And there really is a story here, despite the hype. The characters are complex and real, even if the story itself is a fantasy. Christian is a young billionaire and leads a life most could never attain. In that respect their story is a modern version of the classic fairy tales, such as a modern Cinderella story ‚Äì or perhaps Beauty and the Beast would be more appropriate. But even if it were scaled down and Christian‚Äôs success moderated, the dynamics between him and Anastasia would still make for a great story.,,FROM GREY: FIFTY SHADES AS TOLD BY CHRISTIAN,,The first book in this series takes place between May 9, 2011 and June 9, 2011.,,Christian Grey, twenty-seven, has a lot of rules. Rules keep his world safe and afford him the control he craves. He is CEO of Grey Enterprises Holding, Inc., the Seattle-based company he started after graduating from Harvard. He devotes himself to his work, and it has paid off well. He owes it to his discipline and drive ‚Äì and that he owes to Elena. Without her he probably would have ended up like his mother ‚Äì a druggie who overdosed when he was just four. He has horrible memories of those days, and the nightmares still haunt him. He barely spoke for a long time afterward, even after being adopted by his parents, Carrick and Grace. Despite all the support of his parents, Christian struggled with anger as a child. He was heading down an ugly road until Elena entered his life at age fifteen.,,Elena introduced Christian to the BDSM lifestyle. Following her rules helped him channel his anger and gave him the ability to focus on goals. He stayed with her five years before spreading his wings. He works long hours and doesn‚Äôt have much down time, but in addition to flying and boating, he enjoys unwinding with a sub in his playroom. It is a secret pleasure ‚Äì and he intends to keep it that way. His family hasn‚Äôt a clue ‚Äì he has never brought a girl home before; Elliot thinks he is a monk. Christian has since gone through many submissives over the years. He always enters into contractual agreements with the women so there are never any misunderstandings. It is the only kind of relationship he is capable of, and once the women want more from him he cuts ties. Susannah was his latest, and that ended about two months ago.,,Christian is feeling restless and in need of a diversion when Miss Anastasia Steele stumbles into his office on an uneventful Monday. She is there to interview him for the WSU student newspaper, as he is giving the upcoming commence address. She is uncoordinated and lacks good fashion sense, and is someone he would normally dismiss, but something about her fascinates him. He finds humor where he would usually be irritated, and he sees possibility even though he knows he has no business pursuing her. Christian has never pursued a woman before ‚Äì Elena has always helped him find a new sub. By the time Miss Steele bumbles through the interview, though, he is entirely lost to her unassuming beauty and klutzy charm.,,As the couple tentatively moves forward, Christian hopes to establish boundaries and rules, bringing Anastasia into his world. She is open to trying new things but doesn‚Äôt hide the fact that she wants more. She wants a relationship. Christian knows he is holding back on her. She wants him to open up, but he only really shares with Dr. Flynn ‚Äì and of course Elena. He has secrets that he cannot share with Anastasia because they would scare her away, and he is too selfish to let her go. This story ends in a cliffhanger, but it is one of hope.,,FROM DARKER: FIFTY SHADES DARKER AS TOLD BY CHRISTIAN,,This book takes place between Jun 9.2011 and Jun 18, 2011.,,Christian is more determined than ever to win Anastasia back. After speaking with Dr. Flynn and considerable self-reflection, he has a plan. He had hoped to win her over to his lifestyle, but that had been a colossal mistake. Ms. Steele, he learned, does not enjoy nor does she understand the mindset involved in severe punishments. Christian thought he needed that until she left, but now he will have her any way he can. He has discovered that he wants her more than he needs the safety of his playroom and the punishments he so enjoys administering. And most significantly, he wants more with her, too. He will do whatever it takes to keep her by his side.,,The couple works on building a vanilla relationship, but that is easier said than done. Christian remains a man that craves control in his life, and learning to let go is difficult for him. Anastasia is challenging, yet he enjoys the challenge (when he isn‚Äôt angry). But even as they begin to find happiness again, there are obstacles that threaten the couple. Leila Reed, his former sub, remains on the loose after her attempted suicide in his home. In her current state, Christian cannot be certain that she won‚Äôt cause further harm to herself or others ‚Äì including Ana. And letting Anastasia go to work at her new job is hard enough for Christian to stomach, control freak that he is, but learning that her boss at SIP has a history of going through assistants is troubling. Christian has his eye the editor, but Jack Hyde doesn‚Äôt seem easily intimidated. Elena, too, seems insistent on making herself relevant at a most inconvenient time given Anastasia‚Äôs animosity towards her. Christian and Anastasia‚Äôs confusing relationship is thus further complicated, pushing them into situations they aren‚Äôt prepared to face just as they go public. Their relationship is put to the test over a very short period of time. This book has a happy for now ending, but there are still some rather unsettling questions that remain to be answered.,,IN THIS BOOK:,,This book takes place between June 19, 2011 and September 21, 2011.,,Christian is at the top of world after proposing to Anastasia. After an emotional week ‚Äì dealing with Leila, firing Jack, and surviving a helicopter crash ‚Äì his birthday had reduced all that to insignificance, despite all the drama with Elena and his mother. But that bubble is quickly burst when he and Anastasia leave the boathouse. His father, always his harshest critic, has some words for him, and it seems the two don‚Äôt see eye to eye. Christian still sees Elena as a positive force in his life, and his father couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Carrick suggests Christian isn‚Äôt ready for marriage, and some of those words make an impression, sending him back to Dr. Flynn for answers. Flynn contends that Christian essentially skipped his adolescence and is now learning the lessons he missed earlier in life, but that alone does little to ease his insecurities. Christian may have made tremendous progress since meeting Anastasis, but he still has a lot to learn about relationships.,,Christian deals with the emotional fallout with his parents over their discovery of his past with Elena while also facing the very real possibility of danger. Leila may be getting therapy now, but Christian continues to worry about her progress and the potential threat she poses to Anastasia and himself. But the biggest concern brewing is the crash of Charlie Tango. It looks like his helicopter may have been sabotaged. He and his team are soon hard at work looking for suspects while the investigation into the cause of the crash continues. Anastasia‚Äôs safety become almost an obsession as Christian recognizes that her life may be in danger. His overbearing ways only lead to more problems for the couple.,,All this takes place while planning a quick wedding. Christian and Anastasia do finally tie the knot, and their honeymoon is epic, but the story doesn‚Äôt stop there. They still face challenges as they adjust to married life, and some of their biggest challenges yet remain. Christian still has women in his life that would love to interfere with his newfound happiness. His past is a problem. But perhaps the biggest challenge to his happiness is himself. Christian repeatedly gets in his own way, sabotaging his happiness. There are tears along his journey, but he finally earns his happy ending.,,Christian‚Äôs story is dark, but it humanizes his brokenness. It is different than Anastasia‚Äôs story in that it takes the reader into his world, showing several of his nightmares and flashes of memory. Some of those reflect back on his childhood in Detroit, before he was adopted. Some are reflections of his childhood with the Greys, and there is a little with Elena and his submissives, too. There are also some scenes about his business dealings, giving a look at the confident and put-together man that has achieved so much success professionally. That view of him stands in stark contrast to the unsure man who fears opening himself up and becoming vulnerable. There are some fabulous scenes with Dr. John Flynn that shed more light on Christian‚Äôs inner fears, contrasting them with Flynn‚Äôs sound encouragement. This story goes further into showing Christian‚Äôs relationship with his family, and that glimpse is worthwhile. The biggest bonus found in Christian‚Äôs story is simply getting to know his character intimately. In Anastasia‚Äôs story, it takes time to unravel his tragic past and the abuse he suffered. Here, readers get to see how he reflects back on those times and how it impacts his life. There are several things that he kept from Anastasia, and in reading this it explains a lot of his behavior and decisions.,,This book is a deep and emotional read as Christian‚Äôs character digs deeper to overcome the emotional damage that has prevented him from living a normal life. He has embraced his new life with Anastasia and is committed to facing the challenges. He is devoted to keeping them safe in the face of danger. He and Anastasia build new dreams together, and together they bring them into reality. Christian Grey has become a household name. He represents the quintessential broken and reclusive billionaire who is incapable of a standard relationship or love. He lives a very private life ‚Äì which had been necessary to keep his BDSM lifestyle under wraps. Christian may be dictatorial and brash, but this tells the story of a boy and teen who suffered from abuse and grew into a man whose self worth had been beaten down. His anger never left him; he just channels it into his work and his rules. He hides his vulnerability from the world, too afraid to open himself up to more pain. His story is wonderfully written. The plot is somewhat complex. The characters are carefully crafted and three dimensional. They feel very real. The story is written in first person in Christian‚Äôs POV. I rate this book five full stars.,,As for the Audio: it is beautifully narrated and consistent with the book.,well now that I have gotten the chance to listen to this, I  glad to say that the narrator has improved alot from the 1st  two books. Now Im just dealing with the audio stopping for no reason. grr.,I feel like I waited a lifetime for this to come out! Well worth the wait! It was everything but I loved the other 5 books just as much!,Except for about 10% of the story, Everything is in Fifty Shades Freed. Also, the long and over-detailed sex parts were like watching paint dry. I wished the author would have fast-forwarded to about 10 years to learn new and interesting things about Christian‚Äôs family, and have him reminisce periodically over major past events. I am happy the series is finally over and l must say that I will miss Christian, but not enough to listen to it again.,finally I enjoy that Christian gives more details. to readers at least, Ana being in the dark half the time sucks haha. I feel pity for her lack of being informed, but I enjoyed Christians point of view, because we finally know more.,Why can‚Äôt they use a women‚Äôs voice to speak those parts of the female.  I don‚Äôt want to hear a man reading a female part.  It lost me , and could not continue listening.  It‚Äôs boring.,this is wonderful.  It filled in so many of the unanswered question.    I could not stop listening  to it.,"
Covet,Paranormal,Romance,"I am almost speechless. I literally just finished the audiobook and I have so many emotions. This book was heartbreakingly beautiful, especially for a YA fantasy book.  They way Tracy Wolff handled the whole Hudson or Jaxon choice was perfectly done.  I won't give spoilers but I think Grace is with the man that is best suited for her.,,This book answers a lot of questions and I think we get a much closer look into the characters.  A lot of this book was spent focused outside of the academy, which I think is a good thing.  There wasn't a lot of school drama.  It was all about defeating the vampire king.  I really enjoyed seeing Grace grow as a strong woman/queen/gargoyle.,,I will write a more in depth review in a few days when more people are able to read it. This book had so much in it that I don't want to give away.,I can‚Äôt finish it.  This may be the most childish YA I‚Äôve ever read. Between all the staring and growling low in the throat and all the ruminating about the same thing over and over and over‚Ä¶.ugh.,I‚Äôm really surprised that the ratings on this book are so high.  I was excited when it came out but made myself wait to listen so that I could finish the other books on my list. Maybe it had been too long since I‚Äôd listened to a book in the series. I had to get used to the narrator‚Äôs British accent...it was passable but distracting at times. I would have loved to see this done as a duet narration. I am a fan of the love interest switcheroo if it‚Äôs done right (ACOTAR, TOG, Vampire Diaries, Marked Mage Chronicles). I was excited for this one but evidently Grace was not. It was hard for me to listen to this because Grace spent sooooooo much time whining. She is the epitome of a hypocrite because she demands that everyone be all-in with her while she flits around trying to figure out what she wants. I can excuse the immaturity in a 16 year old, but not in an 18 year old who is apparently the love interest of a creature that has lived 200 years. No thanks. One of my pet peeves with these types of series is when the author tries to draw out the story to make the books longer or to stretch out the series. If you take the repetitiveness out of this book you cut it by 30%. Apparently it got too convoluted for the author because she couldn‚Äôt remember the first time that Hudson and Grace kissed. I also can‚Äôt stand when people decide not to divulge something important in the name of ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù someone it might hurt. Especially when said person would think it was a travesty if any information was withheld from her. The story requires suspension of belief, especially when it comes to Grace‚Äôs ability to influence others thoughts or actions. She is just not the strong character the author makes her out to be. I wanted to make it through this series but it just wasn‚Äôt for me.,I got sucked in on the first book, had to continue in the second and hope the third would be better‚Ä¶ And now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm even going to continue to the next book. I really had high hopes but after 2 consecutive ‚Äúmeh‚Äù books, I am going to do some thing that I have never done before and that is not finish a series.,Tracy's writings are so tight, without a bunch of fluff just to extend the book.  In fact, 21 hours and I couldn't believe the book was over!   Covet continues to deeply develop these characters that have such incredible powers but yet seem to be so human, facing loss, fears and sometimes even self-hatred to a degree.  I love the gentle way they come to terms with forgiveness toward each other as well as themselves.  There are some rather big cliff hangers in this book that I am trying to wrap my head around how only one more book could actually end this series.  These books are deep and I plan to read the 1st two again before I proceed with Court when it is released in September.  Absolutely 100% recommend these book.  My favourite series to date.,enjoyed enough but the book was just too long. a lot of this could have been trimmed down,This series was literally a random buy and I am so freaking obsessed with the main characters. I can‚Äôt wait for the 4th book üñ§,Finally! It's here! I've been waiting since Fall and the cliffhanger was driving me insane.,I am so happy for the ending. I wanted it to happen and it did not disappoint.,,I do agree that she is with the person who is perfect for her & with deep connections to who she really is.,The book was long but I couldn't stop listening to it. It wasn't petty drama it was political. The problems were more mature.,,I can't wait for the next book.,War is coming.,,I just finished the book and I'm going for seconds.,,PS: I loved it so much that I listened to the book 3x already. I wanted more so I went to Target and got the book. BTW, there are extra chapters! So worth it. This is my fave book in the series so far.,Grace‚Äôs repetitive inner monologues about the same thing are annoying. I found myself rolling my eyes and saying ‚ÄúJust shut up‚Äù out loud. In an attempt to extend the story, the author made Grace whiny, self absorbed, and unlikeable.,The narration is poorly done. There are so many mispronounced words, and they could have been avoided with a little research. My skin crawled each time Cherie was pronounced as Cher. And don‚Äôt get me started on the accent attempts‚Ä¶ wrong, off, and down right cringy.,Not my favorite from the series, I found myself dragging along to finish. The narration is horrible, especially when hearing the accent for Hudson.,I‚Äôm not sure why these two actors were chosen because they really aren‚Äôt great. The main narrator mispronounces words left, right and centre and the voice of Hudson is, quite frankly, abysmal. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm British and know what the accent should sound like, but it‚Äôs so wrong that it‚Äôs almost funny. After the last book, I tried desperately to find an audio version without these two - no luck. I had hoped they‚Äôd improve, but that definitely did not happen.,great story can‚Äôt wait for the next book in the series, so many surprises. loving grace and hudsons journey,Plenty of action, but it‚Äôs probably the last one I‚Äôll listen to, the lead character Grace is becoming to annoying on all levels,Loving this saga. Obsessed with it ‚ô•Ô∏è Can't stop reading and listening it ü´∂ They will be a part of me for ever,amazing!! üëè üëè,couldn't stop listening!!!,buy this book, listen to the audiobook. whatever just read it! you can thank me later,enjoyed this epic tale so far. only disappointment was the voice of hudon. not the sound i would have chosen.,not long read the book and listened to all 3 audio books straight after.,I can't get enough of Hudson, he is my new favourite character. I love his sarcasm (only wish there was a little more in this book of it). I love the way he gives Grace a pep talk in the fight with the giants and how he will be hard on her to push her and let her do things and really believes in her. He is amazing. Even at the end where we we see again how much power he really has.,The story at times can be a little predicable but the way the characters have been written it doesn't ruining the flow of the story.,I get annoyed with Grace and how she wouldn't let Hudson in even though when the reasons get explained through the story they make sense but I just want them to get together so much soon.,I missed Macey in this book compared to the first and second ones (which is when when they in jail as she's not there), but loved meeting the new characters.,I can't wait for the next book to find out Hudson promise and what the emerald string relate to.,amazing series, read the 3 books in one week, could not get enough!! rushing September now for book 4 and I cannot wait! if you are a fantasy need like me with a enjoyment for unabridged series then these books are for you,I really enjoyed this book. It‚Äôs one of my favourites so far in the series, excited to start the fourth book. It is so fast pace and action packed if you haven‚Äôt read the series yet definitely recommend. ‚ù§Ô∏è,This series just gets better and better. The characters keep building, I can‚Äôt get through it fast enough.,I have mixed feelings towards this series- I‚Äôm not overly enjoying it but at the same time I still want to find out what happens next. So I guess  that‚Äôs a sign great plot development. But, I‚Äôm also at the point where some phrases and expressions have been so over used it detracts from the story. Some parts are predictable but just go with it. I still think it‚Äôs a mix of the Harry P and Twilight series (not great) so I‚Äôm hoping the author can really shake things up with the next novel. Also the male narrator‚Äôs accent is awful- doesn‚Äôt suit the character at all. However I‚Äôm going to continue with the series because it‚Äôs an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù listen and a nice story to ‚Äúescape‚Äù into overall.,What an excellent addition to the crave series ü•∞ I really enjoyed everything about this book and the performance was outstanding ‚ô•Ô∏è,I like the story line and the world and the characters. Lots of good things. But there are things I‚Äôm not keen on, 1. the lengthy internal monologues that go on and on and on, 2. the writing of the action scenes leaves a lot to be desired, and 3. Hudson‚Äôs voice/accent is awful and absolutely nothing like a real British accent. Hudson is a great character so it‚Äôs quite annoying that his voice doesn‚Äôt do him justice. Would be great to see this character brought to life properly if someone makes a screen version. The voices for everyone are fine though.,This is actually a great audio version of the book except for Hudson‚Äôs voice, the accent is so bad it‚Äôs distracting,Author and narrator are perfect! I‚Äôve been addicted since starting the first book, have now completed the 3rd book and now going crazy waiting for the next 3 books to be released. Thank you,,Thank you, thank you, thank you! Absolutely hooked on these books and so far have not been disappointed in the slightest!,This is everything I wanted and more,Wow Tracy is a goddess!,I love this book 10000%"
Bookshops & Bonedust,"Action & Adventure,Gaslamp",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I really wish it had been marketed as a prequel instead of a sequel. I had high hopes of seeing some of my favorite characters again. The story is good. It has the same feel as Legends and Latte's. but it's not a sequel. it's not even a direct prequel. It takes place well before the first story,Note for potential readers/listeners:  Even though this is a prequel, I'd advise reading or listening to Legends & Lattes first. I think this book could totally be enjoyed on its own, but knowing the context enhanced my enjoyment of this book.,,Bookshops & Bonedust is a prequel that takes place 20 years before Legends & Lattes. In this book, we meet a much younger Viv who has just started her career as an adventurer. Her career gets waylaid (and potentially derailed) by an injury, and she's left behind in a small seaside village to recover. As Viv regains her strength and starts to move around town, we get to know the town and its inhabitants along with her. I fell in love with the place.,,Like Legends & Lattes, this cozy, low-stakes fantasy pulled me in right from the very beginning. I love the great circle of friends Viv gathered around her in this book. That ""found family,"" and a bit of mystery and romance kept me engaged: I literally could not put this book down once I started. It's a fun, feel-good story that not only put a smile on my face, but also brought a tear or two to my eyes. It's another fantastic story by a fantastic author and narrator. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.,,Travis Baldree's narration is excellent as always. He gives each character a distinct and easily recognized voice and personality. His narration really brought this story and its characters to life.,,Highly recommended for fans of Travis Baldree and Legends & Lattes: 5 stars.,I went into listening to Bookshops and Bonedust with apprehension. It was a prequel and with what we knew of Viv‚Äôs life before Legends and Lattes, she was a mercenary, how could that be cozy? Let me tell you, it is. Very rarely is book two as good as book one, but Bookshops and Bonedust lives up to the expectations Legends and Lattes created.,I was very excited for this book to come out. I loved Legends & Lattes, but this one left me disappointed.. I felt nothing for any of the new characters, except the adorable pet that Fern had. The jumps between the books being read in the story and the story itself was blurry. I often times got confused on if I had missed something and suddenly there is new characters. The epilog was really the kick in the teeth for me... It left me wonder if we, the readers, are ever going to see how that ending came about. (I am not gonna leave spoilers) Sadly, I was not happy with this book, but it may be amazing for someone else. Don't skip over this book because of my review. It just wasn't my cup of tea this time around.,,Travis Baldree did wonderfully on the narration, of course.,,,Legends and lattes is a great first book about breaking free of a life of combat and trying to be someone different .,This is a prequel to this, but it‚Äôs clear the author wanted to lean into more of the cozy themes and building aspects from the first.,So why make a prequel? This does nothing but undermine the importance of character development in the first. This would be fine with a new character but it‚Äôs inexplicably retconning a bunch of combat heavy backstory from Viv, who os basically just a vessel. Use another character or make a sequel imo,horrid book, fell flat in plot, character development, oh just such a disappointment. i could not finish it.,A prequel to Legends and Lattes with an epilogue that follows after, Travis Baldree gives us another heart-warming cozy fantasy. Following Viv this time at the beginning of her career, it has a bit more action, but it‚Äôs not too much to feel out of place with the series. I loved the new cast of quirky characters and the delicate nods to the first book peppered throughout. And the epilogue made me cry. Highly recommend.,I love the ease and comfort of these stories. This and Legends and Lattes. I love that they were connected at the end. I love the characters and the simplicity. Thank you!,Travis Baldree‚Äôs skillful storytelling created a comforting haven, allowing me to escape into a world filled with delightful characters. From the gentle pace to the rich character development, every element worked together to craft a tale that felt like a soothing balm for the soul. A truly delightful read for those seeking a cozy escape into a magical embrace.,Travis did an excellent job as usual with both writing and narrating this audiobook.,I was first drawn to ‚ÄúLegends and Lattes‚Äù when I saw the cover art with a female orc behind the counter of a coffee shop at a local Bookstore-a-Million and was very intrigued by the concept. I fully enjoyed it and, as a lover of both coffee and books, I was excited to see a prequel about Viv‚Äôs beginnings was coming out that regarded a bookshop. ‚ÄúBookshops & Bonedust‚Äù did not disappoint and spoke to me on a deeper level than just the presented story. The characters felt distinct and emotionally realistic. The author‚Äôs performance was perfect and I always enjoy when authors read their own works so that you fully experience the story and characters in the way the author intended. By the end of the story, I was surprised that the epilogue actually brought me to tears with the intense feeling of nostalgia through Viv‚Äôs experiences. Now as a 33 year old wife and mother of 2, burn survivor, breast cancer survivor, after going through a miscarriage and bouts depression.. the book made me think of ‚Äúall the little windows‚Äù that I‚Äôve seen so many people through over the years and how they shaped and changed my life, whether they stayed in my life or not. By the end of the book, it had me looking back at my younger self and the ocean of experiences - both wonderful and horrible- between us that made me the woman that I have grown into today.,And I think that‚Äôs MY ‚Äústory beyond the story‚Äù that Viv experienced in her reading of others, that I‚Äôve now experienced by reading HERS.,Travis Baldree knew what he was doing with this and I thank him :)"
Fairy Tale,"Supernatural,Suspense,Fantasy,Fantasy Thriller","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","The king of horror, thrillers, and suspense is back! I was eagerly awaiting the release of Fairy Tale, as I always consider any Stephen King book to be worthy of excitement and celebration.,,Over the last few nights, I experienced the audiobook in relatively short intervals, cherishing and treasuring the time spent with this latest book from one of my favorite authors. Flawlessly plotted, exquisitely detailed, and vividly alive, for me, this story is reminiscent of A Boy and his Dog at the End of the World and, of course, of the cult-classic King novel, 11/22/63.,,Best-selling and award-winning author Stephen King delivers another amazing adventure with Fairy Tale! Set in a strange new and magical world, featuring a number of unforgettable characters compelled to take part in a series of epic events, the story shows us how far a boy is willing to go in order to save his adopted dog.,If you want to find out more about the story, I suggest that you read the Publisher‚Äôs Summary on your own, but I definitely won‚Äôt spoil this awesome Fairy Tale for you here.,,Stephen King is one of the best authors in the world. He has written more than 100 books, short stories, and novellas in almost all genres out there, so we can say that he is an expert in telling tales and fairytales. I experienced many of them as audiobooks and his latest novel, Fairy Tale, is sure to delight and entertain everyone who picks it up ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure that this is a must-buy that will bring excitement to millions of his fans around the world.,,Renowned actor Seth Numrich does a stellar job with the narration for Fairy Tale. He perfectly captures the emotions and drama that our young hero is living. Switching seamlessly between characters, assigning each of them different voices, accents, and personalities, he grabs the listener‚Äôs attention right from the beginning with a superb and emotional performance and doesn‚Äôt let go until the very end. Fairy Tale is Seth Numrich‚Äôs second time performing a Stephen King book, after delivering us Later, last year, but in my humble opinion, he acquitted himself exemplary once again.,,Fairy Tale is classic Stephen King, original, dark, gripping, entertaining, scary and so captivating! If you pick it up, make sure that you have some time on your hands because you won‚Äôt be able to stop listening!,,This is definitely the kind of tale that constant readers and listeners of Stephen King are hoping for. At the end of my review, I feel the need to add a small observation. During his adventures in this new world, our hero will encounter people afflicted with all sorts of disabilities and impairments, from blind to deaf, to physically disabled characters, and so on.,,I know that some readers or listeners could be feeling let down by these portrayals, but I‚Äôm sure that Mr. King didn‚Äôt mean to miss represent any disability or hurt the feelings of anyone on purpose. This is a work of fiction, let‚Äôs just take it this way. Some of you may already know that I‚Äôm blind, so although the characters depicted in this novel feel at times that they don‚Äôt do us any favors when it comes to proper representation of a disabled individual, I enjoyed the many hours spent in their presence.,,I haven't finished this book yet, but my reaction so far is ""are you kidding me???"". This book is dragging on and on and the story isn't even that compelling. I love SK, and I couldn't wait to read this book. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this *yawn*. update-it never really got better. I'm disappointed üòû,First the good part. King is an absolute master at creating vivid characters, both good and evil. As usual with King, the book begins with real-world situations that are completely believable and absorbing. King is also a talented and meticulous writer. Anyone who can write 600 pages with only a couple of grammatical errors is practically a miracle worker in this day and age. Numrich's narration is superb.,,All that said, after listening to half of the book I skipped over something like the next five hours because the plot was becoming so predictable. This was confirmed when I resumed listening to find no surprises whatsoever.,,There are a number of Stephen King books to which I've happily listened several times. Fairy Tale isn't one of those. I won't say it was a waste of 18+ hours -- good writing is always a pleasure -- but I'll be hoping for better next time.,I love many of SK's books. 'Lisey's Story' is a personal favorite: a book where a fantasy world is frightening, feels real. This book is so tedious and derivative, it's painful. The initial 1/3rd is VG. Once we descend the staircase there's so much excess verbiage, it's a headache-inducing listen. I kept thinking (as I skipped chapters): ""Don't bother to stick a fork in me - I'm done!"" A boy loves a dog so much he's willing to forfeit his life. Where have I heard this one before? Dean Koontz comes to mind. Good (not great) narration. I found the ""Wicked Witch of The West"" voice(s) utterly obnoxious. This is YA material. I might have recommended this to a 12yo, but.. parents might object to 'language'. DEF wasted a credit on this one. Never again.üëé,Stephen King has always been a master at world building, suspense, and making the extraordinary seem ordinary. Combing that with a competent, and talented voice actor, and you have a very special Audiobook. I think it rates up there with ""It"", and ""The Stand"".,Boy does Mr King know how to make you feel like you're THERE when you time travel.,phenomenal book and finally one I have enjoyed after multiple stinkers in a row.,You will not regret reading this book. If anything, this book will stay with you long after you‚Äôve finished it. An impressive work of art.,What can you say that hasn't been said about Stephen King? His characters pull you in right away and the subtle references to his other stories is a treat. Can't wait to finish!,This was a wonderful audiobook! I listen to audiobooks while doing my daily chores and I was constantly finding myself stopping and listening and forgetting what I was doing. Just riveting. I don't know what I was expecting but I'm so glad I took the chance on it!,Narrator was great!,Just fascinating at its core, it's about time the king of horrors comes to us with a deep meaningful and engaging story once again!"

Singularity Tower,Adventure,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Good storyline with a MC who knows what he wants. Lots of action (almost too much) and a great supporting cast.,I‚Äôve bought almost every book from this author, and this series does not disappoint. The Haram elements are slow burn. And there is only really two adult scenes in the entire book. This means there is plenty of time for world building and character growth. And the two scenes because of all of this came out amazing. I haven‚Äôt listened to that many books with these two narrators but I guarantee you that I‚Äôm going to do a search for both of them now they both managed to really add the story especially the female narrator she was managed to give every one of the cast a different voice They even used small voice effects when using radios or masks it was quite impressive all in all five out of five,I sure hope this becomes a series.,MC gets on the wrong side of a big corporation he does a job for and they have him thrown in a jail to, hopefully, die, He gets no due process and no proper trial.,The jail, or prison, he gets sent to is this ""Singularity Tower."",It's a dungeon tower that's been there for over a thousand years and it's not designed by one of the local alien species or humans.,He realizes that he needs to climb the tower to escape and joins some women that have their own reasons for climbing the tower.,Great spicy story. May actually start to be HaremLit in book 2.,I give this book 8 out of 5 stars.,The world building is Amazing. The Action is fun and the sex is hot and Not to over the top. Definitely worth buying .,üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçI hope there are more books to come in this series!  The MC is great along with a really good supporting cast!  The story is captivating! The narrators also do a good job of bringing the story to life!  Great job Deacon Frost!,,better than expected, with great characters, world, narration, and pacing, looking forward to book 2"

It has business and leadership principles and action steps to take you and your team to another level. I personally put into action: 1. Start where you are 2. Use what you have 3. Do what you can , to launch 2023 vision for the team. Also we are putting in place how to leave well strategy for leaders when they begin with us so the will be equipped to leave us and the team better than they found us. There are so many practical applications to discover in this book. Thank you, Jeff Henderson! Job well done!,The insight is applicable and inspiring, especially for this Gen Xer who‚Äôs a bit uncertain about moving towards a new startup venture. The stories are encouraging and empowering.,This book has given me so much courage to keep going despite not having a clear plan!,Thanks Jeff,Jeff uses his real-world experiences to talk you through your own journey of decision making for What to do Next in where you are in your own life.  Also, uses calming reassurances about your decisions being a single step of ""next"" as compared to a life-long answer to ""next""; yet at the same time not glossing over the fact that life is a series of connected steps and what we do next indeed matters as we look at our long-term future.,If you read, ""Know what you are FOR"", you'll love ""What to do Next""!  If you haven't read either, I'd HIGHLY advise BOTH!,Additionally, if you are an Audible reader (as I am) and appreciate the author reading their books, you are in luck!  Not only does Jeff read the book himself, but he includes ""extras"" that have occurred since the time the book was completed AND is is an AMAZING speaker, so the delivery will have you hooked!,Couldn't recommend more, especially if you are in a decision-making time of your life!  Enjoy!!!,Jeff clearly poured his heart and effort into this text. This is an incredibly worthwhile read.,Amazing book. Clear, simple steps. Inspiring stories. I had high expectations after reading FOR. And the expectations are exceeded.,Great practical advise to transition from one season to the next.  Provides clarity for the road ahead.,Good encouragement and truths to help in the process of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù.  I loved this book and will probably listen again!,This book is a wonderful resource for anyone navigating transitions in life. Highly recommend it!,Everything in this book is applicable in a season of finding what is next. I have read this book multiple times as my season has evolved, and it always helps me. I appreciate Jeff‚Äôs heart to share his story and to help others. I am so grateful God led me to this book.

Masters of Hex,"Cozy,Supernatural,Paranormal","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Fe and Sully maybe my favorites. I love their love story and she is a complete badass.,I immediately buy every book AML/LHH puts out each month. I listen to the series multiple times.

Come As You Are: Revised and Updated,"Psychology,Gender Studies",Health & Wellness,"This book is the equivalent of ""Full story at 6:00"" She is always telling you what she intends to tell you in chapter 5 or 6 etc. It is so repetitive, I thought something was wrong with my playback.,,The new science as the title suggests just never really got there for me.,Enjoyed the substance of the book but not the style or the writing or the delivery, so much so that had to listen to it much faster. She does a lot of ‚Äúwe will talk more about this in chapter whatever,‚Äù to the point that it is distracting and quite annoying. Worth the read but I probably won‚Äôt pick up more of her stuff.,Dr. Nagoski's  revisions were  necessary, due to some partners' incomprehension of the difference between desire and pleasure. Thanks to Dr. Nagoski for recognizing this issue publicly and addressing it with this new edition.  I am in academia myself and am aware of the fragility of some egos in this domain.  Dr. Nabisco handled the communicative shortcomings in the previous book with utter professionalism and with an eye to collaborative and affirming communication, most especially toward men in heterosexual partnerships.  Good communication is important in partnerships between people of any gender identity and sexual orientation!,My doctor recommend this book. But I ended up reading ‚Äúvagina‚Äù by Naomi wolf before then this. The two books changed my life. The science in this book is amazing. It‚Äôs very validating and educational. It is extremely empowering to anyone to experience this much information and learn about her body and her needs/ likes/ wants and not feel bad or shame or guilt about them. It is healing in many ways and truly allowed me to un-judge myself especially as I go through my healing and inner self work.,Listened to most of it hoping there would be something ""transformational"" as they say in the subtitle, but nope. Certainly nothing scientifically ground breaking in my opinion.,""there is no evolutionary pressure for a hymen to form."" followed by ""in some cultures girls are killed for not having a hymen."",getting killed before you can reproduce is the very definition of evolutionary pressure.,The reason to celebrate diversity because the beauty is found in our differences. This book falsely claims differences don't exist.,This book changed my entire view of sexuality (both male and female) over a weekend! Couldn‚Äôt put it down.,I wish someone gave me this book 15 years ago!! With all the crazy out there, this book is really fantastic, a must read/listen for all women and men. First two chapters were quite ""mmm"" but then it gets better and better.,I found the narration to be annoying. I enjoyed the information, and it is information we all should learn, but the writing tries to be funny and is not. Then the author reading it and trying to be funny is the worst. It is also repetitive. I kept waiting for it to present the information and it is always, ""we'll talk about this more in chapter x"".,Maybe this book has some good information for a teenager or someone that knows nothing about sex or life in general. It didn‚Äôt teach me anything that I didn‚Äôt know already.,I felt infuriated when it talks about the 50 shades of gray, saying women say they don‚Äôt like to be spanked, but deep down it‚Äôs what they really want!,WOW!!!! Gaslighting at its worse and demeaning to women.,Thank God mentioned that Dr John Gottman (that I personally know,  explains that emotional intimacy improves sex in a long term monogamous relationship.,On the other side mentions that Esther Perel says we need emotional distance to desire our partner more. Well, if you are avoidant attached or Intimacy Anorexic! Read Dr Doug Weiss.,Last but not least the voice is very irritating. Looks like a cheerleader for toddlers reading a story about 3 piglets or something. That would be ok for a 20 min story but for a 9 hours audio book starts to get on your nerves.,For me it was a waste of time and money.,,This makes some aspects of sex research seem so obvious. The best of them do. I listened along, thinking: ""oh yeah!"" and ""why didn't I see it that way before?"",,I've already recommended this to a couple of friends (one single, one in a loving relationship), both of whom I think will find it interesting as men to consider from a new perspective.,,This is an updated version of a previously released book about desire, normality in sex and in how the brain and sex organs interact in our experiences of pleasure. Having only listened to the updated version, I cannot comment on the updates, but did find it inclusive of those outside of binary categories of gender, and also aware of its shortcomings in terms of research.,,It's absolutely fascinating. And certainly made me ponder my own history, current position, future wants and attitudes. There are a lot of simple quotable lines that Nagoski refers to regularly, she reassures and explains the range of normality we all encompass. She manages to explain how a lot of problems many readers experience have arisen. And uses examples of 'women' in relationships (composites of a number she has worked with) to exemplify a few key 'types' that demonstrate various points she makes.,,While I've never felt other than existing somewhere along the range of 'normal', this did tick a few boxes and hit a nerve several times when I recognised behaviours, situations and experiences that fit me. Listening to explanations did clear a few things up and make me look at myself and my own body and desires with clearer vision and certainly a lot more kindness, not to mention confidence to express myself.,,One for women to read to get to know themselves. One for men to read to get to know the women around them and how they can both differ and communicate those differences, then work to find common ground.,,This does not become overly scientific or technical, but does use terminology. Loved the Too Long: Didn't Read (TL: DR) at the end of each chapter, great summaries that did remind me of key points.,,The book translates perfectly to audiobook format, and with the addition of the attached pdf (accessible through the Audible menu on the app), gives plenty of material for mulling over, for testing yourself and to return to for future consideration. The author makes an expressive and empathic narrator, and covers her material passionately. It was easy to keep up with her, and she communicates with verve.,,This has already inspired me a little, in seeing myself, my mind and body in a slightly different way. And appreciating how it all got where it is.,,With thanks to Nudge Books for providing a sample Audible copy.,Unless you have a vagina that you're insecure about, skip. 11 and a half hours of her saying sexual context is the solution for women's sexual issues, weird and sometimes false analogies and obvious statements like ""not all women are the same"". Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel is a much better and more educational  book for both genders that doesn't blame everything on patriarchy,This audiobook made me embrace my body and sexuality in such a positive way.,I am very thankful to Emily Nagoski.,Honest, evidenced based and real.,I will be gifting this to all the women in my life!,Every single person should read this book.,This book should be taught and discussed  in schools!,Never have I felt so seen, connected to and understood. This book brought so much clarity to my experiences and I haven't stopped recommending it to friends since.,This book isn't just for women, I urge men (husbands, partners, educators, or just men looking to be better) to listen to this also.,EVERY woman should read this. Even if you don't have any issues when it comes to sex or oragsam it is so educational. It has completely changed how I perceive everything to do with sex and being a woman! Seriously listen to it NOW!!!,If only this book had been available when I was younger perhaps I wouldn't have struggled so much in relationships. But now I have read it I am so empowered and my love life is the best it has ever been.  This book opened my mind and made me re-think so much of my past and how things had been and now I am using what I have learned to make things so much better.  Thank you Emily,Helped me so much. This should be taught EVERYWHERE!!! Such an amazing read. A must read. So much freedom and truth in every word,brilliantly read. amazingly insightful, helpful to know it isn't me. thank you for putting me straight on so much.,Yes there were a lot of metaphors, and yes this was just a big therapy session. BUT! It was a very cheap and very effective therapy session and I always find metaphors very helpful when in session.  This book is fantastic, the content is so important, and everyone should read it.,this book helped me understand myself better and explained so many of my past experiences.,I have just finished listening to ‚ÄúCome As You Are‚Äù (about women‚Äôs sexuality) and loved it so much that I also bought the hard copy book so I can go back and tag and highlight half of it lol!,This book explores anatomy, physiology, behavioural and comparative psychology, evolutionary psychology, health psychology, moral psychology, gender studies, media studies and more. Nagoski breaks down the science through stories, metaphors (my fave was ‚Äúthe little monitor‚Äù), and case studies painting a whole detailed and complex (but easy to grasp) picture of sex and sexuality in the context of us being WHOLE people. It is so much more than a book about transforming your sex life (as the titles tag line suggests) but a book, and knowledge that will transform your relationship with yourself, your body and with your partner/s. I cannot rave about or recommend this enough.,Sidenote,¬†#fuckthepatriarchy,,This is better than therapy! Fantastic book helping women feel normal - just as they are!,Thank you Emily!,My only suggestion is to remove the music, and I wish Emily narrated all herself, the male voices were quiet annoying lol,,This book is about much more than sex or orgasms. It is about understanding how our brains work and how this plays into our relationship with ourselves and others. It tells how media and common cultures around the world misrepresent how our bodies work, often to our detriment. Men, women and everyone in between would benefit from the understanding this books brings.,Books like these can seem like they are directed at a female audience only, but this is not the case. I listened to this book and got such an amazing and eye opening look into how my partners feels about sex. After discussing key point with her I feel more connected with her in our sex life.,(I‚Äôll never ask her if she‚Äôs came again),I leaned a bunch about myself and my partner. I strongly recommend everyone reads/listens.,Such an important book!!!!,Nagoski‚Äôs writing style makes the science easy to understand and relatable.,I highly recommend,Incredibly informative, concise, and life changing. Cannot speak highly enough of how insightful this text is.,Wow! Every woman should read this ... but also every man. This was so insightful and helpful in many ways. It also made me feel like I'm not crazy and that I am infact normal. Now just to keep implementing changes recommended .. so far the changes have helped tremendously.,The only feedback is the music was a bit disjointed and broke up the flow it was quite distracting.,-Jess"
Inheritance,"Action & Adventure,Literature & Fiction,Epic",Teen & Young Adult,"Seriously!  after reading the reviews of this last book I almost decided not to read it.  It was just as good as the previous three.,However, I do believe I understand now why everyone seem to slam it with a disappointing review.,Here is why:,I am sure you all have read many books in the past, and when you finally finish the series you start to imagine what would happen afterwards.  Well in this last book it has that information.  The book actually ended (In my opinion) about 3 quarters (or more) of the way through the book.  In this audio version...  at what I would have called the end of the book there is an addition 4.5 hours left, all of it about what happens afterwards.,Simply put about one (or two) chapters after the war with Galbatorix is over that is what I would call ""The End:"".  The rest of it should have been called something else.  The intensity of everything that had just happened can not be matched with the piddly administrative stuff that happens afterwards.  It was interesting, and I enjoyed reading it. However if the book would have ended where I think it should have, they my last impressions of the book would have been ""OMG!  Wowness!  Group Hug!"".  But if you are like so many others who have left those comments that are less then amazing, it is because they are judging their whole experience on the way the feel at the end of the book.  Which like I said tapers off to Not so Amazing.  In fact it went from ""Group Hug"" to just ""ug""...   :(,But I didn't let that ruin it for me.  Because like I said the bug ended for me with ""OMG! Wowness!  Group Hug!"" the rest was just the administrative stuff that happened afterwards.,Advice read until you find what you feel was the end, then close the book and say ""OMG!  Wowness!""  Gloat on it a bit then when you ready to read about the administrative stuff afterwards open it up again and finish it.,I hope this helps.  Group Hug!,It makes me very sad to say so, but frankly this series just sputtered and died for me.  I liked Paolini's 1st and 3rd books, and I thought the 2nd wasn't bad either.  Book 4 was a huge.... huge... disappointment. And I was really looking forward to it! [FYI, this is coming from the girl who thought the scene where they pick Hrothgar for king was fascinating, lol!],There are some high points. Like one... or maybe two.  But lets put it this way: 8 hours of Eragon killing 5 thousand helpless soldiers with sorrow in his heart ...OR... Roran mooning about Katrina while slicing and dicing humans into convenient cubes. Then ohmygranniespanties the middle of the book happens (and it has trouble rivaling said item of riveting attire). Then 9 hours are spent tying up loose ends (un-imaginativly, incompletely, and unsatisfactorily). Then the end music plays... and I, at least, was left with the feeling you get on 4th of July when it rains. No fireworks this time around, folks!,I think this series had a lot of potential. Shame Paolini wrote a bit better at 14 than at 27.,Recommendations?  Suzzane Collins' 'The Hunger Games', Rafael Sabatini's 'Captain Blood' or 'Scaramouche', Jonathan Stroud's 'Bartimaeus' Series. For more, see my reviews.,,The story line does not follow the logical outcomes.  It goes from being a fantasy story to a tragedy.  The ending gives a feeling of no hope to change the future.  Since his future was foretold and he was cursed by  enemies.  Paolini goes out of his way to write the ending that way.  In doing so , he basically says there are no rider secrets, that his training was a waste of time, since the next rider doesn't have to have the training, He leaves an untrained young dragon in the hands of a rider that has not received the secrets of the riders and will never have that training.,He never answered the question of who the woman and girl was who received his blessing that he made such a large point of in the earlier books. No idea who Angela really is. No knowledge who the high level spy's are.,He tries to make an argument there is no higher beings , yet he believes the future is unchangeable and it is predetermined. Yet without a there being a higher level being; who determines what that future is?,While the other books offered promise of hope and love ,  this one gives nothing but despair and emptiness with no hope of the future.,Paolini showed his lack of maturity with the ending of this book.,,I'm curious to hear from other readers/listeners if they also feel like this isn't the end of the Inheritance series?  Too many story lines were not completed, the woman with the scars (Eragon's mother???), Murtagh and Thorn (what happens to them???), Angela the herbalist (who is she and why does she know so much), who trains Arya with her new dragon, and many more.,I feel like Poalini left me hanging and unsatisfied. Or..  he plans another series of books to explain what he left unsaid.  If that is indeed his plan it was poorly done.  Overall I was engaged in the book until the last few chapters when everyone went off and cried.,The flow of this series has been very good until this book. I'm not sure what happened but it feels like the author lost inspiration. He tried to tie up story lines in a way that wasn't consistent with the world he had created. Other story lines he just left hanging.  In my opinion an unfortunate ending to an otherwise enjoyable series.,I waited for this book for over 3 years. If I had known he would have done such a rushed job I could have waited another year or two!  Not at all what I was expecting!!,I was so disappointed about this book, so EPICALLY disappointed. I am a big fan of books in general and I am an even bigger fan of fantasy books. I love the George R. R. Martin (despite his sadistic way of killing off characters). Tolkien, Terry Goodkind, etc. and after reading book one and book two of the Eragon series despite seeing some gaps in his story I saw growth and I thought to myself ""This guy really will be great...."" but then.... the travesty of book 3 came and then to add fuel to the fire book 4 came which did not in any way shape or form redeem the book for me.,The narration wasn't bad and I actually gave him an extra star for keeping me engaged throughout the scope of this really long book. I almost was going to call it pointless as well but that would have been too harsh besides, I leave that particular description to the third book. He did his accents well and simply worked with what was handed to him to the best of his abilities. I tip my hat to this dude for doing such a good job.,Now the story.... *clenches jaw purposely* Here is my contention.... The main antagonist's death... for someone so incredibly evil.... his death was just downright anticlimactic if you ask me. And then the lead up to the death was just plain annoying. I still stand by the thought (even more so than ever) that the third book served no purpose whatsoever and if the author had combined the 3rd and 4th book (whilst cutting out the useless fodder) this series would not have been such a let down. In fact the main reason this book gets such a negative review from me is because the series on a whole had so much potential. The books went like this for me:,Book 1.... Good,Book 2.... Excellent,Book 3.... Ok... Completely Irrelevant,Book 4.... *Annoyed* I can't believe I invested time and energy in this series.,I have never been this dissatisfied with an antagonist's since I listened to Outlander by Diana Gabaldon (I have yet to get the sour taste out of my mouth where that book is concerned). It didn't help that even after the story ended there was even more added fodder that don't get me wrong was great to know but was an OBVIOUS ploy to potentially add some more to this story in the future if the author so desires (I hope beyond hope he just lets this die unless he seriously improves his writing style). Oh by the way, I saw so many similarities to other things in other timeless fantasy works like Star Wars and LoTR that I found it a bit disturbing to be honest. I am however going to pretend that this was all a coincidence and not drop the rating down another star.,My ultimate belief is that this book should have been a trilogy and nothing more. The really wished and believed this book would have been great but in the word of another reviewer it was simply 'sizzle... sputter... *poof*'.,After waiting years for this conclusion to be published, it was a major disappointment.  The only good thing to say about it was that the narrator did an outstanding job.,The story was horribly overblown.  Paolini never missed a chance to use 100 words where 10 would have sufficed.  But, the worst part was the incredibly disappointing ending.  It is obvious that the author is young.  He resorted to the prosaic comic book super hero ending where the super hero must sacrifice his own happiness for the good of all and give up any chance for love, family, friendship and a normal life.,As has been stated in other reviews, the ending also left a multitude of story threads dangling with no resolution.  If this was merely a ploy to garner support for an outcry for a followup to resolve all these issues, he has lost me.,This was a weak and unnecessary ending to what could have been a powerful series.,The last book pretty much ruined it for me.  It felt like he was trying too hard to tie things up and didn't do the story justice.,This is a great book and a good ending to an epic tale. The first book is my favorite, but this one is a close second."
The Way of Kings,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I gave up on the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series by Volume 5 so never got to Brandon Sanderson‚Äôs concluding contributions to that series. My first books by Sanderson were those of the Mistborn Trilogy. I was totally captivated by the story and its writing.  I avoided The Way of Kings because of its Audible 2 credit price but finally caved because I had lusted so long for something so good as Mistborn. I should not have delayed. The Way of Kings was well worth the price and promises to be one of the best ever series by Sanderson or any SF/Fantasy author. This is Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive.,Coming in at over 45 hours on audiobook or over 1000 pages in print, for some TWoK might seem too lengthy. Personally, for me, it ended all too soon. The book was totally gripping and absorbing. I could not put it down. The writing contains wit and charm, adventure and philosophy, comedy and pathos. It‚Äôs all there, a wide range of human thought and emotion. While constructed of multiple arcs, the writing is completely straight forward, accessible and easy to follow.,I became totally invested in each character and cared for everyone of the good guys and even some of the bad ones.  One of the most interesting characters, one named Szeth, is a peace-loving believer in nonviolence but is also an ultimate, ninja-like assassin who hates to but is forced to kill and cries each time that he does. How‚Äôs that for a crazy mixed-up contradiction. Frankly, I think that Szeth is a metaphor for many of us and our behavior. But among my favorite and central characters were a peasant, apprentice surgeon named Kaladin and a spren named Syl with whom Kal has a rather magical and symbiotic relationship.,Spren appear throughout the book. They were for me various types of conscious energy or spirit-like entities that were part of or associated with almost everything on the planet including specific kinds of thoughts and emotions, wellness and sickness, life and death. They particularly seem to appear when ‚Äúchange‚Äù happens and it is at least at this point in the series difficult to know if they are responsible for, contribute to or are just present when changes in anything from one‚Äôs health to the weather occur.,Speaking of the weather, the environment and particularly the atmosphere of the planet and how the geology, flora and fauna have evolved within the influence of extreme weather is integral to the storyline. The book describes and develops half a dozen interesting and well defined fictional races. Wars exist on the planet among them over the power and dominance brought by the magical weapons known as Shardblades and Shardplates. And, while war is one of the central themes of the book, descriptions of battles and war do not dominate the narrative.,What came across most movingly, uniquely clear and beautifully written were the two human qualities of love and compassion. I do not think that those two attributes have ever been more deftly portrayed than it is in this book. Some of my other favorite SF/Fantasy writers including Dan Simmons and Peter F. Hamilton while brilliant in almost every other respect, fail to adequately communicate those two essential qualities of our nature. Other authors talk about it, their characters go through the motions and maybe say the words but I just do not always ‚Äúfeel the love‚Äù in their writings like I do in reading this book. The humanity and heroism portrayed by some of the characters in TWoK were strikingly remarkable. It is another one of those attributes of Sanderson‚Äôs writing that makes everything more real and capable of eliciting emotions within the reader.,Magic abounds in the book and all of it seems to make sense if ever magic can be made sense of. It was once said that any technology sufficiently advanced will appear as magic and this is that kind magic, magic that can almost be but not quite understood. There is plenty of adventure and excitement contained within the pages and Kate Reading and particularly Michael Kramer bring it all to life. Yes, this is the same duo that narrated the Wheel of Time saga. Their talent was well highlighted there but I believe even more so in The Way of Kings.,This was one great book and the only downside is that Sanderson is so prolific with his other literary pursuits that the sequel to this one is long overdue and the Audible rendition even longer than that.,,I loved this book.  Of course it was a little slow at first, but that's to be expected when background information is being given at the beginning of any long novel.  The characters are well developed and you care about what happens with them.  I got a little tired of the jumps back and forth in time, but that was only minor.  The glaring flaw was in the narration.  Michael Kramer and Kate Reading do a great job and unlike other reviews I have no problem with their style.  Toward the very end of the book though the pronunciation of Sadius was changed by Kate Reading to the point where I was asking myself if a new character had been introduced somewhere that I missed.  I soon figured out who she was talking about, but it's one of those little things that grate on the nerves every time you hear it.  It doesn't seem too much to expect that pronunciation of names be consistent throughout an entire series let alone a single book.  The producers should be embarrassed to put out a final product with such an amateur flaw.  Audio books should be edited as properly as written books.,I have become a big fan of Brandon Sanderson's work and this new series does not disappoint. He has created another interesting world full of rich characters and I can't wait for book two.,The same narrators from the Wheel of Time series re-unite with Sanderson to create another winner. Mistborn, Warbreaker, Elantris, and now this work vaults Sanderson to the top of my must-read list. This book is so good I will gladly listen to it again as a refresher when book two comes out!,Very angry & frustrated listening experience. I learned to appreciate Michael Kramer's performance but Kate Reading CHANGED THE PRONUNCIATION of a key character's name 3/4 through the story!!!! How the hell did this pass editing? It did not help matters that I'd already grown distasteful of her repetitive tone and inappropriate cadence for a narrative story. She reads as though each line is poetry, punctuating the same parts of every sentence with the same tone of voice. This may be great for reading prose but it quickly grew tiresome having to listen to such a repetitive rhythm, and toward the end of the book I was groaning each time the chapters switched from Kramer to Reading. Fantastically gripping and imaginative story once you get past the lengthy slow start though. just wish Kramer had gone it alone.,And for those who move on to the 2nd book Words Of Radiance...Be prepared for Kate Reading's cringe worthy, horribly over exaggerated French(??) accent for the sailor character Yalb -- a bizarre and unprecedented switch from the totally normal accent she'd given him in The Way of Kings. WHAT IS HER ISSUE???? Stormfather help me get through this...please prove that the story is worth her torture,I really, really enjoyed this book. The performances and story easily in my top five favorite Audible titles.,I was was introduced to Sanderson by listening the Mistborn series (which I enjoyed). Sanderson is very good at making his characters three dimensional as well as bringing his settings to life. He creates a full background and mythology for his characters that give a fullness to the experience of his stories.,The performances here are top notch. I significantly preferred the sections performed by Michael Kramer but both narrators fit their main characters well and do a great job of creating separate, distinguishing voices for their characters.,HERE'S THE WARNING: This book does not have a complete ending. I hadn't realized that book two isn't out yet. When I finished this book, I was ready to skip all of the other titles on my listening list and go straight into the next book. I've listened to enough preexisting series (Dresden Files is a good example) that I expected to continue the story when this book left me hanging. I know I'm spoiled and I'm whining a bit but hurry up!  I was already feeling extremely impatient waiting for Rothfuss's next Kingkiller Chronicles (another don't-miss-it series with a similar epic feel to Sanderson's) but now I've definitely become a whiny-baby.,The book does have a partially satisfying ending but, like most series premiers, it leaves many things unresolved and many questions unanswered. This book is still on my list of must-listens but be prepared to long for book two.,,The Way of Kings is Sanderson's greatest work to date. the characters, the world, the story are all masterfully written, and truly comes to life with the reading of Micheal Kramer and Kate Reading. getting those two to narrate the book was a truly brilliant decision on the part of the publisher.,,I cannot say enough good things about this book. from beginning to end, despite the book's length, it held my interest like few books I've read recently. There really aren't any truly slow periods. there are periods without action, or without exposition, or without drama, but there is never a scene that feels unnecessary. Normaly, i only listen to books when I am at work, but this one pulled me in so completely that i listened to it every free moment, and it even kept me up into the wee hours of the morning, unable to tear myself away. the last five or six hours were, hands down, the most riveting fiction I have ever encountered, and far beyond what one might expect from merely the first book of what is planned as a ten book series. Where the Wheel of time starts at a slow burn with The Eye of the World, The Way of Kings hits the ground running.,,The Stormlight Archive is the new face of epic fantasy, like the Wheel of Time was before it. Sanderson has truly come into his own on this one.,I'll get this out of the way because it pains me to write this - I tried many times to wrap my head around Kate Reading's phonation and cadence but it was so unnatural that it routinely broke immersion. She intonates words the way an early computer speech program would. It may seem pedantic if you're just reading reviews but if you listen you will see what I mean.,Overall the entire story and the chapters read by Kramer are truly phenomenal. My favourite work of Sanderson thus far.,I read Warbreaker when Brandon became Robert Jordan's successor, as I wanted to measure his writing style against my expectations for the Wheel of Time. I have since devoured every novel (except the Alacatraz books) he's written. I expected TWoK to be on par with all his other excellent works, but I was completely blown away. This is far and above Sanderson's best work, and that's really saying something because all his other books are, in my opinion, outstanding.,,Oh, and Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are awesome. That is all.,I love epic fantasies and was very much looking forward to getting lost in this one. But after 35 hours, it is still a collection of character sketches -- sketches of uninteresting characters who make really stupid decisions for extraordinarily contrived reasons. As I listen, I repeatedly find myself thinking, ""No one thinks this way. This character is doing exactly the opposite of what both emotion and reason dictate. Obviously the author is contriving a thought process and forcing this character to make a certain decision just to move the plot along. Oh, wait a minute. There is no plot. Why am I still listening to this?"",,Why? Because it is Brandon Sanderson, and he has written way too many books that are nothing short of awesome to delete this one from my playlist.,,Now, I'm sure there are a lot of audible members going through these comments, thinking, ""Well, I'll see what everyone else is saying about 'The Way of Kings,' but I'm going to download it anyway."",,My advice: Lower your expectations. Not only is the plot thin and the characters shallow, but the dialog -- the writing itself -- can be finger-nails-on-a-chalkboard grading,I'm about halfway through and I've loved it so far. It seems to start off a bit slow but its worth it. Love everything Brandon Sanderson has written. Plus its a great deal 45 hours for one credit. You can hardly go wrong unless its completely boring, which it isn't.,,Name of the Wind it the only fantasy book I've read this year that I liked more.,Brandon is probably the best writer of Epic fantasy in the world! He creats and draw you in into an dark and wellconstructed world.,The story and characters are captivating and you cant stop listning. The Narrorator is also the King of dark Epic fantasy and suits Brandons books perfectly! Really makes you belive in the story and characters.,The female reader has incredibly annoying inflection. No emotion, weird upswing on the end of the sentence.,It takes a good chunk to get into it, but it flowers out into an interesting and dynamic story, leaving you loving the characters.,The biggest downside here is both of the narrators, most of the male parts are a little monotonous, but luckily good writing prevails through. For the female narrator I agree with how robotic and impersonal she comes across. Making almost no distinction between male or female speakers in her parts.,Good book but somewhat slow setup. The Alethi are supposed to be a masterful waring society but the author failed to convince MF of this. Waring, yes; sophisticated tacticians, I think not‚Ä¶ this aspect was disappointing as from the last books of The Wheel of Time, I know Sanderson to be proficient at describing war scenes and tactics.,Narration was fine; not many character voice changes but the accents were ok and not distracting. The last part of the book in the hospital needs to be re-recorded. Female audio changes from one perspective to another throughout this scene, which was annoying. It sounds like two different female narrators and sound quality is off. It took the focus away from the scene.,The story wasn't that bad actually, but I took 1 star more, as the next book is terrible and had I knew, I wouldn't start the series.,The world is very different than your typical fantasy, but it's also very odd and, well, I didn't like it at all.,Overall, the series is tiresome and the main arc is not interesting, I wouldn't start it again.,The performance is absolutely the worst I've ever heard. This duo here should stay away from ever recording their voice again. The whole book is read in a monotonne, the voices between characters  barely change at all. It's seriously bad. Enormously bad. In fact it's so bad, I had to switch to other language for the second book.,took a long while for it to make some sense. and for me to like the characters.,top notch performance by both narrators.,the story unfolds slowly. but it all becomes worth it in the end.,it doesn't resolve many .. if any of the conflicts in this book.,interested to see what happens next. It's a good start to an epic story.,It was hard to get a hold of the story at first, alot of impressions at the same time, but when I got the story and the characters I was more than entruiged. Will buy the next book aswell.,Dang. Been a while since I've enjoyed a book this much! It's just epic, can't get enough!,The pinnacle of fantasy and one of Brandon's best works to date. Takes a long time to get into and has a steep learning curve but trust me, it is worth every word.,Kate Reading and Michael Kramer are beyond incredible, and Brandon Sanderson is a genius.,The story takes a while to get you hooked, but once you are, you're never leaving. Phenomenal performance.,This book stands alongside Malazan, king killer chronicles and WoT. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with this book."
Mistletoe Murders 2,,,"Please make more and more of these! I‚Äôll never get tired of listening. Love the story, characters and actors.,I was in love with the first Mistletoe Murder, I don‚Äôt know how this one slipped by me for a few weeks! Soooo glad I came across this second installment and that it‚Äôs an audiobook instead of podcast so I didn‚Äôt have to go from episode to episode. There‚Äôs a cliffhanger so there has to be a part 3‚Ä¶counting down!,,Several cases solved. Good narration. Clean stories. I liked it.,Listened while i made Christmas gifts.,These are tight little whodunit mysteries of which the only thing Christmasy about them is the time of year they take place in. The characters are interesting and there's a real chance to work out who did the killings. If you like a short whodunit, here are four of them.,The only negative thing to say is that it is too short. Love love love Cobie Smulders and the entire cast, can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,Such a great performance and the episodic format lets you take small bites with short stories that play into a larger one. Great for while working out or morning commute when you can‚Äôt get fully sucked into hours on end.,Very excited to see where the next book takes us as the cliff hanger definitely sets us up for some tense twists!,It was cozy and murderous at the same time! Very well performed and keeps you listening!,I enjoyed listening to this! The cast was great and the story kept me entertained. I can‚Äôt wait for the next one to come out,Good time listen.

Rival Radio,"Contemporary,Romantic Comedy",Romance,"This story reminded me a lot about The Ex Talk. Many times I was ready to put it down, but it pulled me right back with Daria and Theo‚Äôs honesty. I think I loved that more than anything. When Theo ask‚Äôs Daria to be honest she is and all through the book she‚Äôs afraid because of her past but she is willing to try! That right there is refreshing, most romance books are full of miscommunication and ‚Äúpride,‚Äù so they go around for 80% of the story being stupid.,There was no unnecessary drama, no cheating, and yes it had a happy ending with two epilogues!,Well done üëèüèª,I can‚Äôt wait to discover more from this author.,Narration was great. I recommend this audio to those who loved The Ex Talk and want to take a break from the miscommunication tropes.,Overall:  üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü /5,Spice Level:  üå∂üå∂üå∂.5/5,Recommend: Yes!!,Re-read/re-listen: Yes!!,Trope: Enemies to lovers, Office Romance, opposites attract,Narrators: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü/5.,Maxine Mitchell and Gabriel Spires.,,‚Ä¢ Characters: Daria Stone and Theo Chadwick ‚ô•Ô∏è,‚Ä¢Story:,What do you do when you find yourself having to co-host a radio show with someone who has the complete opposite of your views when it comes to love? Grin and bare it.  Daria is against marriage and soul mates. Theo can't wait to fond his HEA. Can these two work together, or will they forever be Rivals?,‚Ä¢ Favorite parts:,You can not be quantified. You can not be studied or measured. I couldn‚Äôt distill the magnificence of who you are into a pithy piece of advice if I tried for a hundred years. You are a marvel, and I love you. I‚Äôm in love with you. -This right here was everything. I loved this so much.,I also loved this as well.  You could live in a cold house with stoic parents receiving the bare minimum of affection, and then, years later, it could appear in all the places you never even thought to look. Love was persistent like that.,‚Ä¢ Thoughts:,This book made me soooo happy. I loved every minute of it. I can say this is probably my favorite Kathryn Nolan book. This book hit different in the relationship department.  A true testament on what listening and being hibest in a relationship can mean. This book should be a 101 before entering into a relationship. It was just perfect, and I could not say enough great things about this book. Read it!! And truly grasp the meaning. This is a fun book that touches on what opposites feel about love.,Narrators:,Maxine is straight up a queen! She can do no wrong in my eyes. This book is no exception,Gabriel Spires is a new to me narrator and he just gained a fan! I loved him! Loved him!!!!,Kathryn Nolan is such a talented and amazing writer,  but this book really makes her shine.  Maxine Mitchell's performances get better and better with each audiobook I listen to.  She gave Daria such depth. Gabriel Spires is new to the game, and this is one of his first audiobooks.  I really enjoyed Gabriel's narration and voice.  He does have some work to do when differentiating his voice for female characters, especially multiple females in one scene,  but overall,  his narration did NOT take away from the beauty of the story. In fact,  he definitely enhanced and elevated Theo's character.  This is a MUST READ for everyone!,Theo and Daria‚Ä¶they may sound like they hate each other but with these two there is really a fine line between love and hate. I just love all that banter between the two. They really were enemies but underneath it all they started to crush and crush hard on each other. Especially when their boss combines both their radio shows into one. I enjoyed reading their story with that funny banter, competition, and yes at times dealing with their underlying issues.,Performance: they picked amazing narrators for this story. I always enjoy Maxine Mitchell. Gabriel Spires is a new to me narrator and OMG was he the perfect fit for Theo! He definitely had a ‚Äúradio‚Äù voice. His voice was very reminiscent of Casey Casem. Together, these two really brought Theo and Daria to life!,Parts of this book were very off-putting, but there IS a great romance to be found here. It's like the author had an inclusivity bingo card and decided to win a game of full card cover with this book alone. This book is brought down by shoehorned inclusivity/political statements. I dismissed the negative reviews referencing this when buying this title because I assumed it would be things mentioned here and there and people were overreacting (as is often the case.) Unfortunately, they were not exaggerating. By chapter 21, I wondered if the author had gotten bingo yet. Listen, inclusivity is great. I am a proponent of inclusivity. But forced inclusivity messes up the flow of a story and jolts the reader out of the story. An example I like to use is Bridgerton. Bridgerton is inclusive without ripping viewers out of the show as you watch it. Everything fits together seamlessly, as the story unfolds on the screen. The audience doesn't feel like they are being hit over the head with political statements.,With that being said, Theo and Daria's story is enjoyable, with a lot of great communication and hot sex scenes. The beginning was a little rough for me because I didn't understand why they were drawn to each other, but it soon became clear they had a mutual respect and attraction. I enjoyed the psychology aspect brought into this story.,I'm giving this story three stars, however, I highly recommend the audiobook for Gabriel Spires' performance alone. He rocketed to the top of my favorite narrators list with this title and I will be searching for more titles by him.,,I love the moral of this story. Love your self and then you can be ready to love others. Enemies to lovers is my favorite trope and Kathryn did this so well. Loved it,I thought this book was fun and sexy and wonderful as all of Kathryn Nolan‚Äôs books. It‚Äôs very true to who she is as a person as well.,,The story was good enough, but it didn‚Äôt keep me wanting more. The male narrator reminded me of Casey Kasem and so that‚Äôs all I could picture in my head.,I really liked this book. It was a little slow at first but once it got going I couldn‚Äôt put it down. Gabriel Spires was a new to me narrator and all I can say is WOW. Chapter 19 was üî•. I‚Äôve already purchased another audiobook narrated by him because ü´†. And i love anything narrated by Maxine Mitchell. Overall 4 stars. I recommend this one!,Kathryn Nolan delivers again! Engaging and entertaining story, great characters, excellent narration, and plenty of spice!"
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Book 4","Growing Up & Facts of Life,Family Life,Fantasy & Magic,Fantasy",Children's Audiobooks,"Ive already listened to the first three Harry Potter books on audible after reading the hard covers three times through and watching the movies count less time but they are just as exciting every time I hear the story.  The only thing I can‚Äôt stand is every time hermione says Harry it sounds like harreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee and I can‚Äôt stand it. Other wise everything is great.,I know it‚Äôs sacrilege to say anything against Jim Dale, but why do all the women always sound like their whining? Why can‚Äôt Hermione say ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúHarrrrrrrreee‚Äù?  It‚Äôs so upsetting to hear this voice. I wish we could get the Stephen Fry versions in the US.,Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?,Yes because it's Harry Potter!,What other book might you compare Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Book 4 to and why?,No comparison period.,Which scene was your favorite?,The Second Task,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,I was shocked by the ending, didn't see that coming.,Any additional comments?,Audible, even though I love that you have added Harry Potter to your list of books I am also upset that each chapter of every Harry Potter book is missing it's chapter title which ruins the experience of this wonderful story but it is also disrespectful to J.K. Rowling and the art form of writing to totally disregard what Rowling wrote. If Rowling wanted the chapters to just be numbered she could have easily done that; she didn't; she named every chapter; the chapter titles enhance the experience not just an after thought. They are also functional because I may not always use the bookmarks or remember the number of the chapter I left off at. Often times I spot the chapters name and immediately know where I am in the story. You are the only app that I know of that doesn't include the chapter titles in there app. Please change your app to include the chapter titles for all digital audiobooks you sell.,Jim Dale is without a doubt one of the top 3 narrators I have ever heard, and I have been an audio book addict for 10 years. The book needs no review, as it is as masterful as its six sisters. This is by far the most well spent credit I have ever used, and I look forward to completing the entire collection.,‚ÄúWe are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.‚Äù,‚Äï J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8 July 2000. By this time. everyone was on the Harry Potter train. Steven King was reviewing Goblet of Fire for the New York Times, and news was out that they were going to be making Harry Potter into a movie. This book was released simultaneously in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. It was a phenomenon. It won the Hugo. We all felt it. Grandmas who didn't read kids books were having the first three foisted on them.,This was also when I discovered how funny JK Rowling was. Don't get me wrong she was funny before, but Goblet of Fire pushed not only the gas on length, but also her sharp wit. As the team (Harry, Ron and Hermione) is growing up, so the humor gets a little richer and the plot starts getting a bit darker.,,I LOVE the whole Harry Potter series. Why does this narrator continue to say Harry's name drawn out like ""Haaareeeey"" when he quotes one of the characters. He does it for Hagrid as well. It is so very annoying.,I did not care for Jim Dale‚Äôs voice. I felt it was a poor choice for the narration.,Story:  Goblet of Fire is definitely one of the better stories in the series.  The previous three were really good and I admit that Prisoner of Azkaban is still one of my favorites, but Goblet of Fire really lets the magic start to shine!  The Tri-Wizard tournament and all the tasks were so captivating and illustrated so brilliantely that it was hard to stop listening.  It's also interesting getting a look at the character progression and how they develop and also how the story continues to grow.  You'll find a full story here, with twists, turns, witt, suspense and more.,Performance:  Once again, this was another great performance.  Jim Dale does a great job of capturing the characters and I believe gets them pretty spot on.  More and more characters are introduced in the books and he finds a way to give them unique voices.,Overall:  I really don't know what to say about this story to do it justice.  The Tri-Wizard tournament and all the detail within the three tasks was excellent.  The maze at the end and how completely different it was from the movie (I've only seen the movie up until now)- that really surprised me because I thought the movie would be at least somewhat similar.  The amount of detail that somehow continues to grow and continues to develop the story is amazing.  This is definitely a great story with great narration that can be enjoyed over and over again.,I love the book. the narrator just pronounces things funny. like Voldemort with no t.,I'm a fan of Jim Dale now... I'm looking forward the next book .. thank you so much for what you do."
A Fire in the Flesh,"Fantasy,Paranormal",Romance,"This was a great book. Made some shocking connections to the other series. I need the next books asap! Please! Amazing author and exciting books!,I love this series. I couldn't wait for this and still can't wait for the next, BUT. I tolerate recapping at the beginning because I get it, but after that the story should keep moving forward. she dwells on EVERYTHING. it's not hard to recognize when someone in the story says something that will be important later on. but in the meantime just keep revisiting I guess. and I'm so frustrated on all of the hints (since the first book I picked it up, I might add) on what's coming but of course that's skated over the entire series. I'm going to keep my hopes up for the next, though.,If you love the Sera and Nyktos story then hang tight and keep pushing through. The first 28-30 chapters are hard, lots of internal conflict that‚Äôs extremely repetitive. Story doesn‚Äôt actually pick up until 28-30. It gets really frustrating hearing Sera go backwards with her emotions towards Nyktos from book 2 (of this series). There is sooo much information that is easily missed, lots of re-listening to chapters.,Will listen to again to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss something and know where to skip when stuck in repetitive monologue. Hoping the next book(s) in this series aren‚Äôt this rough or take as long to really get the story going.,I am hearby vowing not to buy anymore 3rd installments of any of JLA books, I will simply look up a spoiler page or some type of cliff notes. This is not anime ma'am, you cannot just put in a filler season and hope it's cute enough to get by. I'm not even half way through and had to go read reviews to see if it gets better, apparently it does not. I will finish this book, eventually, just for the sake of the series, but this is not the first time she has done this. it seems like the other longer series she writes has the same issue with the 3rd book. slow, torturous inner monolog  that goes nowhere for a majority of the book, then some story progress at the very end. and for the love Chocolate stop making it seem like women are incapable of handling their impulses and emotions! ""Omg he's so terrible, how ever will I be able to sleep with him so I can get him in a compromising position and kill him?!"" PUT YOUR BIG GIRL PANTIES ON! oh wait, he didn't give you panties, lololol...I'm going to get flack for this, but any woman out there that hasn't gone to bed with someone to get something they wanted...well bless your woefully unsullied heart...but here is the thing, Sera is not that person, she has openly admitted to sleeping with strangers at what is essentially a brothel on several occasions. "" the embers started vibrating, and I could help it I...""<---insert whatever stupid thing Sera did here. over and over and over. 2/3 of this book is an elaboration on the story Eios told us about her time with Kolis. or telling us about the ascended, which we have FBAA for. whatever other scraps of relevant unknown information that is contained in this portion of the book could have, and should have, been presented in a more concise manner. We know how this story ultimately ends because of FBAA, this book needs meat and potatoes topped with gravy, but right now I'm sifting through the gravy to find substance.,We got a lot of important info in this book and a lot of subtle growth within Sera that she doesn‚Äôt realize has happened until the end. We also gut a good look at the true depravity of our overarching villain in bigger series. Yes, this one is a bit slow but it‚Äôs a middle book that‚Äôs doing a lot of heavy lifting in terms of mapping, growth, and informing where we shall go from here aka setup for the battle we all know is coming. This book and the next have to take us up to Poppy so the backstory was absolutely necessary. I absolutely love this series and recommend it every chance I get. JLA is amazing. I,I don't normally write reviews but I'm absolutely livid about this book. I have read a lot of books by this author and really enjoyed them.  I loved the first two books in this series and waited impatiently for this third book. I also loved Stina Nielson who did an incredible job in this entire series. But,  I should have read the negative reviews before I purchased it because they are all accurate.  First 31 chapters are without Ash, or any of the characters we came to love in book 2.  These chapters could have been the first THREE chapters, instead of 31! What we learn over 31 chapters is that Kolis is a A-hole (we knew that already) and Sera is more neurotic  than we ever imagined.  Her inner monologue goes on for chapter after miserable chapter.  Nothing happens except repetition of the storyline we already knew.,,Finally, in chapter 32, we get our lovers back together and they head home.  There is some completion of the storyline about Sera's long, desperate, ""I am dying"" issue which seems too simple after books of anguishing over this. There is very little interaction with the beloved characters like Nektos, the Drakon little ones, Bella, Raine, etc. We have no clue what happened to the Shadowlands during Ash's absence. Then we have chapters, literally chapters!! of spice as Ash and Sera get back together.  (A little is nice but too much means we didn't have a story to tell so we'll just have sex.) This book is 80% boring and 20% percent action that moves the plot along.  An incredible disappointment from Jennifer Armentrout. This book could have been an 10 chapter novella.  It wasn't a real book.,I found myself so bored by the constant internal monologue. I loved the first 2 in the series so am really disappointed.,As much as I absolutely adore Sera and Ash so so much, this book did feel a bit slow for me. Given the plot, my favorite part of this series wasn't there as much, so I am sure that is part of it. I will say as if we didn't know how strong Sera was, we really get to see it here a ton. There is also a good amount of important information we learn here as well. My absolute favorite part, though, was getting to see how powerful of a connection Ash and Sera have. Especially seeing from Ash how important Sera is and just how amazing of a couple they are. I anxiously await the finale of this series and will be so sad not to get more of these two. They have become one of my favorite all-time couples.,Felt very repetitive‚Ä¶ not my favorite installment in this series.  I was hoping for more story development.  This felt a bit recycled and the story line didn‚Äôt build much til about 75% of the way through the book.  And even then it was sort of meh.,While the narrator is great she spoke so slowly, drawing out a a story that was already quite slow. Unlike the other books in this series, this one moved so slowly I considered giving up about halfway in. There was so much time spent in the main character‚Äôs head while she sorted through every possible thing ‚Ä¶ her current situation, how she got there, how to get out, what her captor must be feeling, what Nyktos must be feeling, her own past traumas and on, and on, and on.  It took 3/4 of the story for anything to actually happen and even then the action was over pretty quickly.,Wow! This was an emotional roller coaster of emotions! I couldn‚Äôt put this down, so glad I was able to tandem read this with audible and kindle. The last few chapters had my heart in my mouth! This was another masterpiece by this author.,I laughed. I cried. My heart was racing needing to know what happens but DESPERATELY not wanting this book to end. For my own sanity, I should have paced myself cause I know the wait for the next instalment is going to be pure torture.,When Fire in the Flesh parallel series came out along side FBAA, I was so pleasantly surprised, Sera and Nyktos quickly became my favorite couple.,With every new addition to their story I fell for them more and more. I feel that with this latest one I am now just so pleased for them.,It was a great decision on JLA part not to rush the story and add even more to this 600+ pages book just to end on the originally planned trilogy. I loved getting those last chapters. Unrushed. Just pure literally pleasure and Stina‚Äôs amazing performance.,What also really surprised and made this book one of JLA strongest is how she wrote Kolis. To come into this story only having pure hate for him and then become in moments torn between feeling sorry for him and hating him all over again was a constant fight in my head. It was so well written. You can really tell JLA took her time fleshing out what makes up what I feel is either a psychopath or a sociopath. Or both. Just such strong writing.,All in all - fantastic. As always. Cant wait to see the end to both of the story lines.,I love this book! It takes a bit too long for me to see our couple reunited, but once it happens! Wow! True love! Heart mates ‚ù§Ô∏è can't wait for the next book!,One of the best ones so far! JLA is a genius! So is Stina Nielsen!,From the wonderful Stina Nielsen's narration to the story that is better with every next book,it was all that i expected and more.a lot of revelations and a lot of emotions ...i didn't sleep until I finished the book,and now I,m on reread. Love it.Thank you JLA :),Oooooh it‚Äôs all coming together for the fire in the flesh series and of course the from blood and ash series. My mind has been thoroughly been blown with all the answers you have speculated about throughout the two series. Great story too. Not just a tying everything up book. Thank you for another great book and even though it‚Äôs only been 10 hours since released, im fully game for the next book lol. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.,Book 1 and 2 are amazing. But what happened here?!?? I cant stand the dragging on and the repetition of the same things and thoughts. Honestly skip it don‚Äôt bother you wont miss out on anything google what you need to know.,I have enjoyed all of Jennifer L. Armentrout flesh and fire books. The storytelling was captivating and kept me gripped throughout the series. On to my next set of books.,I loved the first two books but this one is a pain to get through. It‚Äôs supposed to be relaxing or exiting to listen to a book, not enraging. Halfway through and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôll just read a summary to see if it gets any better and if so skip to that part. If not, I‚Äôll ditch this series completely.,Unfortunately the last couple of JLA books have really suffered from far too much waffling and poor pacing, this one is no different. I LOVE this series as a whole, the lore is fabulous and this certainly delivers on revealing lots of unexpected twists. However, there is so much repetition with dialogue and unnecessary rambling that drags out the book. The pacing suffers for it significantly and like the 5th blood and Ash book, feels like it could have been half the length to achieve what it did. Especially after the pacing of the first two books, this was agonising at times, especially towards the end. I'm keen to read the final book, but I'm begging JLA to be a little more thorough with editing out waffle. I get that this is deeply rooted in being a fantasy smut but all this poor pacing only kills any tension those scenes could have and make them tedious.,That aside one positive note I'll add is that I did appreciate how issues of ptsd/trauma and consent/abuse were approached (though it too suffered from waffling and overkill). It felt very relatable to my own experiences in a way that didn't gloss over or forgive certain altercations. The mental health rep feels good to me! It just didn't really need to be dragged out so significantly. If you have triggers for the above mentioned though you may wish to proceed with caution/be aware before starting.,It was ok and I guess it was needed to tell missing pieces of the story but I just kept going on.,Could have been achieved in a quarter of the chapters. Should have been an optional novella at best.,I like this series and the other one too, but the pacing was very slow compared to the others.,It was also far too repetitive and waffle-y. This book was kind of a letdown.,Will definitely listen to the next book, and I hope more stuff happens.,As always, the narrator is amazing.,Firstly, Stina Nielsen always does such an amazing job and I always love listening to her narration and is probably the reason I am giving this a generously 3 stars but I was SO disappointed with this book. I enjoyed the 1st & 2nd book & love the FBBA series but this one definitely fell flat for me. I was so confused with all the chaotic mess for the first 9/10 chapters and was so bored with everything until Sera was finally reunited with Ash. It immediately got better once they were together again BUT *spoiler alert* you‚Äôre going to have to wait until a good half way until they are reunited.,Secondly, I love smut/spice as much as the next girly (I‚Äôve read some fucked up shit) but I feel like it was so unnecessary towards the end of the book & I feel like JLA jammed it all in there to make up for lost time but I was just too much. Sera was meant to be DYING - I thought they should have been able to do so much more with her time before she ‚Äòdied‚Äô.,I really hope the next books for this series & FBAA make up for this one. Please Jennifer I beg.,Cannot wait for the next book!,I am totally absorbed in this story.  Love it!,This is one of the most beautiful love stories. I love the dialogues and the character building. 10/10,just love it. makes me want to start the blood and ash series again!,I loved this book. Totally amazing. I can‚Äôt wait for the next book in this series.,I trully enjoyed listening to this book. My favourite of the whole series :)"
The Infinite and the Divine,"Fantasy,Science Fiction",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The is a book about two immortal NERDS fighting and trolling each other over a mcguffin. Which turns out to be exactly what I wanted.,""The wheel always turns"",-Orkan the Diviner,""Fuck you Orikan"",-Trazyn The Infinite,i loved it,,I. Love. This. Story.,,I am a massive Warhammer 40K fan. In particular, I have been collecting Necron models since close to their initial release in 2002. I've been sticking with these guys through the initial tank shredding 1st Codex, through the Wardian era, and now through the Indomitus era. This story pretty much embodies everything great about the Necrons and in particular, the characters of Trazyn the Infinite and Orikan the Diviner. This story is basically ""two old dudes troll each other mercilessly over the course of several millennia"" and it is everything I had hoped it would be. You couldn't ask for a more perfect pair of protagonists in Trazyn and Orikan, both functional demigods of an ancient sentient race that had long since given up their flesh and blood to become the immortal robots that we know them as through the course of this story. One looks to the past to one day rebuild their lost culture, the other looks to the future to see what could be. Through these conflicting viewpoints, they are set on inevitable collision courses spanning tens of thousands of years, and it is a beautiful sight to watch this trainwreck of a dysfunctional co-dependant relationship unfold.,,It does require a little bit of knowledge of the Warhammer 40K universe to fully appreciate, but if you like sci-fi dark comedies, it is well worth the little investment to learn what an ""Aeldari"" is or what is meant by a Necron's ""Necrodermis."",,I stan Trazycan all the way.,The most bitter and petty rivalry between horrifying immortal robot skeletons I've ever listened to.,Really good story and an Amazing performance. Both principal characters written incredibly well and brought to life by the narrator in a stunning and convincing fashion. Super enjoyable. On of the best 40k audios there is, and especially great if you want a break from human stories.,you can tell that the author actually cares about the lore and universe in this book,& that's not a hood thing!,Most Gods awful 40k novel I've ever bought. For all their aeons of regal-ness & suchlike, they're just grumpy, petty, morons. It's not even so bad that it's funny. I'm 2/3rds in & it's still going nowhere & doing nothing.,,The Narrator is ok, but too often voices are too similar. I've had to skip back more than a few times to suss a conversation out.,,I took the advice of all the glowing reviews... & I'm just stun'd at how bad it is! I can [& do!] give a 40k novel a good amount of leeway in quality, as overall it's not hard to find redeeming qualities here & there. I can't, I just can't with this book. If this is what Necrons are like in the Black Library-Verse..? Gods I hope not, as I really want to get to know these ancient dynasts. But yeah, if this is how they're to be written, never again!,Love the performance and writing. The deep look into the grumpy old crons and Necron Court, couldn't be more entertaining.,Fantastic performance by the narrator. Well executed concepts of immortal beings, and how they experience time.,Of 40k audiobooks. Definitely recommend this one for Necron fans old and new. Gives Necrons more flavor while still keeping them obviously alien.,Probably the most unexpected 40K book that had me captivated, laughing and liking Necrons. Robert Rath has written my favourite 40k book and Richard Reed gave a superb performance.,I absolutely loved this book, from the interesting view of the Necron perspective of the galaxy, to Trazyn just collecting anything that catches his eye.,An amazing performance with amazing characters.,I loved every second of this book it's fun without being childish and gives character to aliens often less explored.,A big surprise, this book was great, it showed the Necrons in a fantastic new way, with more comedy than you would expect. It's very well written, with a fantastic narration. But whoever chose the rubbish art for this book need to re-think their life choices because it hides a truly great read!,They be a good pair o lads when they ain't at each others throats. Daft as a brush each a them. Entertainin' yarn an an half, especially when folks start a right barney.,Brilliant story and narration. Well worth it just for the exchanges between Trazyn and Orikan alone. A chance to view the 41st millennium from the perspective of the ancient Necrontyr which is incredibly entertaining all on its own. Highly recommend you pick this one up.,loved this book. gives a great feeling of the Necrons while still having a great deal of humor.,Well worth getting if you're a Necron fan of not, our two main characters Orikan the Diviner and Trazyn the Infinite are fighting over who gets to open a tomb world first and get all the diabolical goodies that lie within it. Rather than the usual Grim-Dark we have gotten before about the necrons this is possible the funniest book Black Library have done in sometime and the fact it's the Necrons that are telling the jokes is a nice surprise, giving life to the ancient immortal living metal monsters. Hopefully Black library will be doing more books centred on the Xeno's races in the future.,Worth it for the voice acting alone. Gives the necrons a lot of personality, I love these characters!,loved it, best Games Workshop story I've listened to so far.,The glimpse in to Necron culture was a nice touch and I wasn't expecting the ending at all.,Great book.,What a performance, every character felt distinct and the effort that must've gone into those little expressions to make character interactions flow together really shows.,Well written characters that interact together nicely.,Amazing to see the Xenos races getting some love and all the little references were well received.,I recommend.,A really enjoyable story. Great to see some of the other factions of 40K getting some love. Not one single Ultramarine was even mentioned.,Really enjoyed it, would definitely recommend it to any who want to learn more about the Necrons, plus was quite funny,one of the best 40k books no annoying side storys that suddenly take from the story just a none stop ride of necron awesomeness,Finally some xenos perspective with some personality. Fun with a dash of grim dark 40k. Excellent oration.,i Have read a good 30 40k books and this is my favourite.,If you are a necron fan this is something you need to listen to. If you aren't its still a good time.,Should be the title of this book.,Narration was great, genuinely good story for a Warhammer novel, cool lore bits and lots of different factions showing up thanks to Trazyns pokeballs... uh, i mean his tesseract vaults.,Trazyn and Orikans bickering is pretty funny at times - enjoyed this book alot! Made a nice change to see things from someones point of view besides the Imperium.,The story is truly amazing, at times it is a bit comical but it transitions smoothly between comedic moments and emotional, impactful scenes and frankly, the emotional scenes with Trazyn and Orikan are just golden. Moreover the chemistry between the characters such as Trazyn and Orikan really bring out the unique nature of the cast of characters. And honestly Richard Reed's performance as all the characters is truly amazing, from switching between Trazyn, Orikan, orks and other necrons, he truly pulls off every character as unique.,,Honestly I wholeheartedly recommend listening to this title if you either are a fan of the necrons or want to understand the necrons or generally a fan of watching two undead old dudes just pranking the other for a few thousand years. plus the title is a breath of fresh air considering how imperium focused much of the warhammer 40k titles are.,the narrator and his performances were excellent. the story itself holds up very well but the narrator enhanced the novel greatly.,Too much unecesssary detail and description made this a disconnected experience to get through. Listened to the whole thing, as it is considered a strong 40k classic, but I'd definitely skip it unless you love Necron."
The Silencer Series Box Set Books 1-4,"Crime Thrillers,Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this series but I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books and will continue to follow this series. Those of you that have to compare every novel to Mitch Rapp or the Gray Man,might not like it. The narrator was fairly good but sounded a bit inexperienced. He has a lot of potential if that is true.,I appreciate Mike Ryan‚Äôs vivid imagination to create the character John Smith and David Jones keeps this series moving from page to page.,The exploits of CIA operatives on America soil is something average citizens only know about through movies, tv shows and Hollywood movies.  This book keeps you glued to each chapter. John Smith is a cold mechanic who despises those who steal from and hurt others. His for of justice is swift and permanent.  With the help of is computer guru Mr Jones, he directs John Smiths talents to crime scenes as they tale place.,After 3 1/2 years his old company becomes aware of his exploits. Now with local police who are looking for a vigilante killer and CIA looking for a rogue agent Mike Smith stays one step ahead, until. . . You will have to read to know the rest.,After finishing this 4 book set, I down loaded the next 4 books in this series.,The story line, theme and narration are good, but most of the book is about how the characters feel, think and reason. I wanted to listen to the whole book, but had to quit. I just couldn‚Äôt stand to listen any more why everyone felt the way they did, how they logically decided upon their actions, or what they thought about others. Too much brain stuff and not enough action.,""Preposterous."" I said that at least 5 times in the first book. But I kept listening, and I enjoyed it, but it remains preposterous.,,If you have seen the CBS television series ‚ÄúPerson of Interest‚Äùthen these books will be a little more enjoyable. You can put faces to the names. As it is a direct poll from that television series.Ôøº,Series is kind of slow. One or two action scenes per book. Characters are good.,I took a chance on this book series because I didn't know the author. It definitely exceeded my expectations. It was a great series & I'm starting the next series now. Highly recommend to others,Books are excellent, not to many dull moments. I'm looking forward to the next set just waiting for my credit.  I would definitely recommend.,,Getting the box set definitely makes this a fun book. Good story, good narration (I liked it at least) and a unique story line. As usual, the engineered drama (boy/girl, good guy/bad guy, moral/immoral) stuff gets a bit tedious, but doesn‚Äôt get in the way of a fun listen.,I get that authors (artists in general) look to other mediums and works for inspiration. This wasn't that. For those of you who saw the CBS show Person of Interest, you will find similarities abound: Ex Special Operations type burned by a rogue element in his agency finds refuge in a northeastern US city, working with a reclusive hacker who wants to use the data gleaned from the NSA that isn't national security related to help those in need. The plot and the writing were just lazy, it was if the author had very few original thoughts of his own, and just altered scripts from the TV show. I don't know if he was a writer on the show, or just thought he could do it better, but he missed the mark.,,The narrator was the only bright spot of this experience, and that's not saying much. He was acceptable, but he didn't draw me into the world like other great narrators I've listened to. Maybe it was the material he was working with. I'd be willing to give books he reads another shot, but I will definitely be passing on anything written by the author of this work.,,Save your credits and save your money, catch the Person of Interest series on Netflix or CBS instead.,I've never written a bad review, but felt compelled to do so.  First book is excellent.  Face paced and a great story.  Main character is a tough guy as he should be with this background.  However, second book in he has fallen for one of the most pathetic female character ever and I don't know the exact timescale but it took all of a month..  So now he as trouble concentrating and leaves a mission so he can go and rescue her.  My eyes did so much rolling, I've lost them in the back of my head somewhere.  Book 2 was like a Mills and Boon romance with the odd bit of torture/murder.  Sadly, I was unable to read any further.,Brilliant / amazing stories/ story line!  I am severely dyslexic and struggle to read and understand books been read to me unless I can get my brain into the story line and this had me hooked from the start!  I am about to start boom five in the second set of books in this story arch and I have already with the help of my partner found and downloaded all the other stories in this series!! Can not listen enough! Thank Mike for your writing and Brian as your reading / narration is just on point üòä,Read these BEFORE Reacher, the story is good but lacks the luster of Reacher. I read all the Teacher stories before these which, with out hindsight was a mistake. Had I read these first I would not have a to struggle to read the next one. With the Reacher series I was reading well into the night, unable to put them down, just the next chapter and the next..,interesting storyline, modern day hero. justice served in an odd way but very intriguing.,Action, Adventure and a great story line running in 4 editions. Highly recommend you listen to the series.,total unbelievable pap. I got a third of the way into book 2 but just couldn't force myself to go on with this bollocks.,Audible Review,THE SILENCER,The narrator, Brian Hutchison, was very good. The plot is very reminiscent of an American TV show (the name of which, I truly can‚Äôt remember)! It also reads like it. It‚Äôs quite episodic. Interesting, but not really a novel, therefore really easy to read in one day. (I‚Äôll try to remember the name of the show and update the review). 3 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,EDIT: ‚ÄòPerson Of Interest‚Äô is the name of the TV show. I don‚Äôt know which came first, but the show was better. The show had the police as ‚Äòaccomplices‚Äô, rather than the gang lords...,FULLY LOADED,This is not a novel really. It‚Äôs an extended episode. In my review of the first book in this series, I opined that it was very similar to a TV show (Person Of Interest), so this is like the ‚Äòscreenplay‚Äô of an episode. So, it‚Äôs interesting, kinda, but it‚Äôs not a novel. It‚Äôs just episodic.,One observation is that Mia, is really tedious and annoying. I can easily do without her... <sigh>. 4 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,HARD TARGET,To be honest, I spitefully want to give this title only 1 star ‚≠êÔ∏è, but that wouldn‚Äôt be fair because, it‚Äôs an emotive reaction based on my total dislike of the character Mia! She is absolutely tedious, irritating, silly and dumb!,So that alone tells me that this is a good story! If you‚Äôve seen my previous reviews of books one and two, you‚Äôll know that I think of this as a TV series, it is episodic, Not a novel but an episode of an ongoing TV series. So this is the first book that actually reads like a novel and maybe that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not itemising and detailing the various ‚Äòjobs‚Äô that he undertakes. This is an episode/story written around the ‚Äòstupid‚Äô female Mia the nurse and her stupid, ill informed, reckless actions.,I‚Äôm over her and would be MORE than happy if she were removed!! Sigh.  So in terms of episodic interest, this was a great emotive one. But the emotions are anger, frustration and a desire to slap this woman. Sigh. 3 reluctant stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,BLOWBACK,Finally at episode 4 of this TV series (see my previous reviews of books 1-3), this comes into its own! I‚Äôm now tempted to read book 5!,Mia now has a boyfriend (who Recker doesn‚Äôt trust), so I dare say there‚Äôs scope for her to further get on my nerves in future episodes! Recker and Jones are making plans to relocate because the CIA have finally located, Recker. The tensions and interests behind these factors are now starting to make this series more of a novel than previously. However it is STILL episodic and really has definite links to the ‚ÄòPerson Of Interest‚Äô TV Show. I discovered today that POI was written first! It ran for 5 seasons (I think) and was really good. I hope that this series now goes from strength to strength! Not quite 5 stars yet! 4 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,This is the the worst book I‚Äôve ever (partially) listened to. I really like the genre and I know they have to be a bit cheesy. I persisted past the halfway point but couldn‚Äôt continue. I‚Äôve seen better plots in pornos. It starts off OK (OK in a super greasy quadruple cheese burger kind of way) then it goes really down hill. This international man of mystery is doing odd jobs that just fall into his lap. I haven‚Äôt listened to the end but I bet he‚Äôs walking down the street when he sees two strong men threatening an old lady; he try‚Äôs to calm the men down but has to beat them up. If a twelve year old was tasked with writing the remake of Walker Texas Ranger this is what you would get.,(Also there are some sound quality issues.),... I still might listen to the whole thing (sunk cost fallacy),The reader's  voice could  have lightened  up a little, but i guess the character is a very grief stricken,betrayed and angry man,I thought that the reader had a  good, speaking voice though.,and i liked his  portrayal of  the characters, thanks,I could not make it through to the end. the cringe was overwhelming.,The plot is weak and the characters poorly described and without depth.,The protagonist comes across as a murderous psychopath rather than a rough around the edges hero.,Some suspension of disbelief is required in this genre, but this series of stories throws all credibility out the window very early on.,The piece never builds tension, the action scenes described by someone obviously unfamiliar with the physicality and weapons, and much of the story focuses on feelings, so much so I believe that this is a ladies attempt to write in the voice of a man. There are many wonderful authors who can do this, maybe not so many in this genre, and definitely the author of this book is not one of them.,A real lowlight for me was at the ""climax"" of the third story where Wrecker instead of shooting at the bad guy just walks straight towards him as he fires a whole mag missing every shot so Wrecker can get up close to shoot him point blanc. ""...he died instantly"",completely ridiculous.,The narrator does a fine job,I really enjoyed this series, I just found the narration a little flat. A scene about the character eating dinner is delivered the same way as a shootout scene, it's difficult to really enjoy the suspense and drama if the narrator seems constantly bored.,His voices are good and they fit the characters,his pronunciation is spot on most of the time and he doesn't seem to miss read words, I just wish he would get excited about things sometimes.,good book overall. frustrating at times and the ending was abrupt without much finality.,im sorry but this is the first book i couldnt finnish on audible. it just didnt entertain me,The story is almost a copy of the TV show ""Person of Interest"" - I actually checked to see if they where linked because they are so similar. The details wont stand up to any real scrutiny, and the character development is quite immature. that being said, the books did keep me engaged during my drive to work, which is why I purchased the book.,fun fast moving but the plots are bit to shallow for my liking - a few twists would help a lot"
Lady of Ashes,Fantasy,Romance,"So so so good! I read all the books and I have been waiting for this series to come out on audio forever and it was worth the wait! Great story line, amazing characters and world building, and the performance for audio is fantastic!! By far my favorite book series ever üòçüòç"
Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone,"Romance,Historical",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"After the ridiculously long wait, I expected better than this‚Ä¶. The storyline was lukewarm at best. The narration was pretty good, considering the 7 year gap, but, how hard is it to listen to what you‚Äôve already done so you can make sure it matches this time around? Several characters were not the same in the beginning‚Ä¶.Brianna, Mandy, Lord John, etc., but started to sound a little bit more like the previous books once she got further in.  And now, after how many books, everyone is suddenly pronouncing Germain‚Äôs name the French way, adding to the feeling of incongruity.,This book just didn‚Äôt feel the same as the others‚Ä¶. It felt choppy and disjointed. Scenarios were introduced, then dropped or forgotten, which didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.   And time after time, Diana has blamed the slow progress of the book on her ‚Äúhistorical research‚Äù, but there really wasn‚Äôt that much reference to historical events.  I think she, like George RR Martin before her, was just too caught up in the tv show to bother with the book.,And the mistakes‚Ä¶..this always bugs me‚Ä¶how can an author not remember her own characters? Let me help you Diana‚Ä¶. Ian is ‚ÄúWolf‚Äôs brother‚Äù, not ‚Äú He who walks with wolves‚Äù üôÑ, and the last time Claire saw Joseph (Ulysses) was not at River Run, but at her own house when he accompanied Jocasta and Duncan on their way through to Canada‚Ä¶.,Lots of loose ends, which is to be expected, since we all know there is one more book coming, however, are Davina Porter and I going to live long enough to be able to read it? I think the fan base is going to fall off dramatically if we‚Äôre forced to wait another 7 years for the conclusion.    After reading this installment, it‚Äôs probably not even worth it. I mean, does anybody even care anymore if we get the last Game of Thrones book?,Having loved every single book in the series, I did not foresee the turn this book would take. Unfortunately, it seems as if Diana Gabaldon has had some kind of religious awakening, and it oozes out of half the chapters of this book. God this, the Bible that, and saints and all kinds of religious paraphernalia to boot.,As someone who is rather anti-religious, I was willing to suffer through some of this for a good story or three, and getting closer to the characters. Unfortunately, that was not what I found. The stories closely resembled ones in earlier books, and the only real character development was William taking a tiny step towards adult responsibilities.,I never anticipated being so disappointed in this book, and feel that some of it must be my fault. But surely the editors could have cut down somewhat on the repetitions and asked for more character development?,I was happy to revisit this lovely characters. For me the best part is alway Jaime and Claire interaction. I also loved Bree and Willie chapters, but I was disappointed in the story overall. No character growth, abandoned plot lines, forced scenarios and ridiculous coincidences. The story was all over the place.,I really wanted to love it. I am going to re-read the book in a few days to see if my opinion changes, but for now just I am just underwhelmed.,I agree with the reader Eirin from Norway, there is way too much emphasis on religion. If I had wanted to read a religious based book I would have. Instead, a time-travel/love story that is supposed to be historical fiction is steeped in Catholic and Protestant religion - and is extremely prejudiced about anyone not practicing some form of Christianity. It was also written in a very choppy form with regurgitated stories, little plot development and too much time spent on miscellaneous characters. As a huge fan of the Outlander book series and television series, I am hugely disappointed in this phoned-in, 9th installment that is part catechism, part re-telling of the prior wonderful 8 books. I would not recommend this book to anyone and will tell my family and friends they can feel free to take a pass on this one.,I have been eagerly waiting for the book I preordered the first day it was possible. In the meantime, I listened again to the last few chapters of A Breath of Snow and Ashes. I check shortly after midnight but it finally dropped in at 2:30 AM. The first two chapters immediately closed the gap and reassured me I was back in Fraser‚Äôs Ridge with my friends.,I love the characters, but feel this book holds waaay too many flashbacks/recaps and explanations of thoughts - there really isn't as much plot to it as previous books, yet it is insanely long! 2/3 of it could have been cut and it would've been much more enjoyable for me and had me looking forward to the last book in the series. This left me wishing this had been the last one.,This was the first book of the Outlander series that has left me disappointed.  I have waited, re-read, and re-listened to the first 8 books in preparation for this book. It was full of repetition, very little character development and several mistakes made by Diana about her character's history.,This felt like I was reading numerous, incomplete stories with side characters I didn't care to hear about.,There were also so many story lines that seemed to have just gotten lost in the book. I did not know there was going to be a 10th book so I was so disappointed in so many things left unfinished and an major cliffhanger.,There were times in this book I had to force myself to not fast forward through sections.  I hope Diana goes back to her previous storytelling in the next book, told for her faithful readers, not written to catch up all the television series newcomers.  I hope I can try to read this book again and like it more, otherwise I can't see me caring to wait for the next 7 years for book 10. And that makes me sad.,If you are a fan, you will be disappointed.  Anything new could have been covered in a couple of hours.  Then some of the stories seemed rushed, I don't get it!  The rest were flashbacks, and explanation of when this and that.  I waited for such a long time for this and planned and scheduled myself for this book.  I'm dissatisfied, nothing like all the other books,  Perhaps the next one wont take as long and it wont be filled with the past.,The story feels rushed. To many new situations and characters that were not resolved or dealt with, and old characters almost ignored. Dottie and Denny,  barely mentioned.  Agnes baby and marriage ignored.  Bree's pregnancy was barely mentioned before she had the baby. This book felt like is was ghost-written by someone who didn't fully grasp all the storyines.,I have just finished this book. I really loved it, but I wasn‚Äôt surprised by that. If anyone wants to know. I read this book at speeds varying from 2.6% speed and 3.1 speed. Divina Porter is a fantastic narrator as always. I love that the story picked up up where book 8 ended. I also love that we got to see characters from some of the older books and see their stories wrap up. I will warn everyone though it does in on a cliffhanger. That was hard, but I can always wait for book 10.,What I love about this series is that the characters remain consistent and interesting. Well done Diana and Davina! I thoroughly enjoyed it and am excited for book 10. It was worth the almost 7.5 year wait.,PS, for those of you who are curious, I finished the book in 17 hours and 12 minutes.,Probably my least favourite of the series but still really enjoyed it. Not as gripping as previous installments and lacking in character development for many, some fleshing out would have been nice, but I loved the tender moments. Enjoying seeing the couple growing older together. Looking forward to seeing where they end up after the ending here, time will tell. Not necessarily the most thrilling experience with Claire, Jamie & co, but I for one would happily listen again and enjoyed being back at the ridge all the same.,as ever the characterisations and narration were excellent. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of everyday life  but for me the story lacked the excitement and dizzying twists and turns of the other novels.,Having read and listened to all of the books in the Outlander series, two times over, it was fabulous to finally find out how this installment would unfold.,Used to the fast pace writing and action, interspersed with slower chapters of daily life, that Diana Gabaldon is normally expert at,  I found myself slightly bored with this book half way in, of course I persevered til the end as I love the characters.,There was not enough action or drama this time, and considering the war was about to break, I can't figure out why this book and the next were not dedicated to life during the war years. Nothing of real note really happened in this book and any action scenes seemed to be cut short and were disappointing. It seems to have been used as a vehicle for setting the scene for the much anticipated final book.,Davina Porter, as ever, did a fantastic job in the narrating of this book, if there are awards for narration she needs to win.,I know I will have to wait years for the affirmed final book and I really, really, hope it's a great finale.,I like this book very much. Finished and started again directly, just to enjoy the story, the details, the writing and, not least, Davina Porter's excellent reading"

Fall of Radiance,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The story draws you in and builds well.,The narrators individually are good, however, together are not. They each do the voices for all of the characters rather than having them choose characters and doing them constantly through out the story. As it is, the voices become confusing chapter to chapter. Real missed opportunity and really detracts from the book.,I've listened to Tolkien, Jordan, Rothfuss, Sanderson...etc... This was a struggle to listen to.         Not a huge fan of Kate Redding (female narrator) but other stories have made that not matter so much.,The story had potential. But everything was rushed and half assed. Terribly predictable. Cliches stacked on cliches. Blatant rip offs from more talented authors.,I have to finish a book once I start it. So... If you're like me, do yourself a favor and just don't.,I'm gonna listen to The Wheel of Time series again to wash my brain out.,The only great thing about this purchase besides the length is the narration. The story is not bad, just uninspired. The characters and their relation to each other is formulaic and run of the mill. Sometimes the writing by the author is so unvaried and repetitive I literally wondered if I was listening to a chapter or paragraph again or if I pressed ""rewind"" on the audible. The main magic user is quite questionable with how she manages to get out of some fights too. She can do some things that the author literally says ""she has no idea how she casts this spell"" like she has never heard of it and never knew the words to it but she did it anyway. Far too convenient. That's just the first of many convenient saves she does. If you want something that just takes up time but won't impress you or hardly make you laugh then this is an okay investment.,I read some bad reviews and some good reviews before deciding I usually end up enjoying what others don‚Äôt. This was worth the listen all day. Michael Kramer and Kate Reading do a fantastic job as always. If you like The Cycle of Arawan/ Cycle of Galand series, the Licanius Trilogy, Stormlight Archive, then you‚Äôll like this. I‚Äôm sure I could find some negative aspects of the story but I‚Äôm not one of those people to pick apart a story. I listen to my fantasy audible books so I don‚Äôt have to suffer repetitive Spotify playlists. If you‚Äôre reading reviews to figure out if the Fall of Radiance is worth the credit, my vote is yes. Now off to find another series!,The duo of Michael Kramer, Kate Reading do it again. They bring a great story to life. I'm sure these two can read a phone book and it would sound good but when it's paired with a story like Fall of Radiance it makes a good series even better.,I had purchased book 1 several months back and while I felt it had some notable shortcomings, I still felt the series held the promise of righting itself and becoming an epic fantasy. Especially so with considering two renowned narrators in their own right, Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. So, when the series came out in box form, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase the whole series.,,While the medieval fantasy series hadn't descended into 21 century mores it suffered from a large imbalance of leadership roles between the sexes. Women were generally the brightest characters and the best leaders while men in power mostly were ruthless and evil, with a few exceptions. Even for the men who were good, they were often portrayed as having significant character flaws. These flaws were focused on so much of the series, I kept thinking I was hearing Michael Bubl√© in the background singing, ""Call me irresponsible, Call me unreliable, Throw in undependable, toooooo ..."". Even worse, the primary male apprentice warden, Owen, was a moody, whiny and insecure person making Zarra's fascination with him seem like more of a mothering mate than that of a lover.,,Blake Arthur Peel's writing skills are quite good but his decision to write this fantasy as a mixture between adventure and harlequin novel along with the constant repetition of over-used homilies throughout was off-putting.,If this wasn't the GREATEST story I've ever read!! The world building the characters are believable and amazing.  I found myself outwardly screaming in surprise as well as triumph cheering the characters on at every turn. I laughed I cried. just absolutely  THE BEST,10/10 would highly recommend!!!!!,I previously listened to, liked, and reviewed the first book. Listening to this collection has not changed my opinion.,,I was given this audiobook for free (again) and have voluntarily left this review.,Well written and solid narration by the two narrators. The story moved at a good pace and the character development was rich and detailed. The action scenes were very descriptive and I felt caught up in those scenes. Highly recommended - another hit from the folks at Aethon Books!!,This was a fabulous series. I am sorry to see it come to an end. The writing picturesque in detail was performed in such a way that I never lost track. I could see all in my minds eye. I‚Äôm keeping this one to listen to again. Thank you so much. T,Both readers were brilliant and brought each person to life  left me wanting more a sad ending to Owen and Zara and Mages  Warriors,Got through the first two of the cooks but gave up on by the third deciding to listen to something I could enjoy. Badly written and thin poorly considered plot.,Totally absorbed from start to fantastic finish. Highly recommended, an amazing listen. A world I just don‚Äôt want to leave.,This is basic modern fantasy tale. Mostly suited for young adults or if you are new to the genre. Experienced fantasy readers will most likely find it mundane and lack orginilaity / uniqeness.,I usually listen to audio books while doing something else but sometimes a story is so compelling that I sit down and listen to it - this was one of those.  It's a story of enduring love and the struggle between friendship & duty.  Unputdownable,I purchased this as I had a spare credit and I‚Äôve always enjoyed performances by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading before. As always their performances can‚Äôt be faulted but unfortunately the material they had to work with was not great. I listened to the whole thing but at time it was a struggle for all the eye rolling.,The premise is somewhat interesting, but the characters lack depth and consistency, the world building is lacklustre and the many plot points rely on minor characters acting irrationally in a way that was obviously just designed to further the plot.,Added to this that the use of first person narration is somewhat jarring and I just can‚Äôt recommend the book at all.,predictable in a good way,.all the right formular.................,i will definitely look at more books by author,,It takes a loot for me to quit a book, even if it's not great but this is 1 I will be returning. Don't listen to the review that said if you like Sanderson or Sarah J Maas you'll like these as even with 1 of my favourite narrators, I couldn't carry on, try as I might.,It's boring beyond belief; like he took a template of the usual things you might find in a fantasy novel but with no creativity. Nothing happening of import for hours & no personality of it's own, no suspense or anything really. Just 'blah""!,Getting 50hrs is only good value if it's at least passable & this series isn't. Not sure how it's got so many good reviews unless people are bought off by the complete series thing being offered. I'd rather listen to constant re-runs of good authors like Raymond E Feist, Robert Jordan, David Eddings, Brandon Sanderson etc than any of this dire-tribe but each to their own I guess.,Great story and Characters involved. Just a really involved situation from start to finish. Had to list for the last hour to hear how it ended.,,A struggle with flat characters, predictable, silly with every fantasy trope available. Good narrators.,I DID listen to the whole thing, but by the end it was getting to be a real struggle.  Truly awful grammar in places grated on my nerves and pulled me out of the story .. ""closed the door/eyes shut""  etc., together with another of my pet hates - ""off-of"" or ""bored of"" .. like nails down a blackboard, if anyone remembers those. Additionally - a little (or a lot) too ""preachy"", gauche, naive, ingenuous? .. maybe not the right age group for my tastes perhaps. Also, much as I have really enjoyed listening to Michael and Kate in other books, I'm finding they're all starting to sound the same. Maybe time for a 'palate cleanser' for me. üôÇ,Likeable characters doing stupid things and with sensibilities out of the 1940s ""not that kind of girl"",villains and allys so stupid, the only justification is the extent of corruption in the isolated government. let's go to extreme lengths to keep the demons ravaging the world a secret.,A willingness to kill characters akin to that of game of thrones. No plot armour here(outside of the main 2),Overall it's not a terrible book though slightly cliche.,Michael and Kate put on a stellar performance as always.,I hate giving a bad review but well what can I say? good story concept, written flatly and sloppy as porridge. Good ending though.,great narration concept, if it wasn't for the near monotone of Kate, it could have made the book.,Sorry but I would say this was a waist of time if it didn't help me go quickly to sleep.,It may be alright for a 10 year old young reader in the original book form.,Just loved the entire story, the only thing that annoyed me was the 2 main characters romance.. But everything else was great.,Great story, good pace, sadly a bit predictable, but overall glad I tried it,These novels will frustrate avid fantasy readers familiar with works of Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan. Heavily inspired by these authors, fans will find the direct references to similar characters and world-building elements jolting and lacklustre. YA and teen readers unfamiliar with common fantasy plot lines may find this a fun, well narrated series.,while somewhat of a predictable ending, they overall story was good. The first person narration worked,Really enjoyed my time listening to this story. Sad that it had to end but glad to finally see what the ending was to be.,I enjoyed the story line. the narrator's did a good job. The characters were great.,took a while to get invested in the story but overall quite good and great value for a single credit."

Broken Dreams,"Contemporary,Romantic Comedy",Romance,"I want to move to small town Sugarloaf where the air is sweet and the residents even sweeter. But, right now, the air is full of the town‚Äôs gossip about Single Dad Grady and Single Mom Addison - two strangers who, the town think, seem perfect for each other, However good the show seems, nobody but Grady and Addy really know that it‚Äôs all fake with an agenda and an agreed end date.. a boyfriend for an upcoming wedding and a girlfriend to woo and win over some investors. In front of everyone (including friends and family) Grady and Addy play their part very convincingly.. too well perhaps. Because behind the ‚Äòfake‚Äô scenes it‚Äôs become very real.. they like each other.. they open up to each other.. they‚Äôve both been heartbroken with the death of a spouse.. and they‚Äôve got so much else in common.. and their cute little kids are becoming best friends. And the growing friendship, desire and sexual chemistry is going to blur those fragile lines. However, one of them is ready to move on.. but one is still living in fear that lighting will strike twice. So let Corinne‚Äôs bitter-sweet beautiful story of love second time around grab your attention, soothe your soul and melt your heart.,,Worth a credit? Yes, I loved the slow-build.. the loveable hero and heroine.. the blossoming relationship that gets stronger and stronger.. the secondary characters including their precious 3 yr olds. I also love the sizzles and the love that builds, binds and bonds the four of them into a beautiful loving family. The narration by Sebastian and Kit was on-point and made the cast of characters, their very real rollercoaster of emotions, the fire and flames and the variety of feels come alive. It‚Äôs also got family banter, a community of well-wishing gossips, a happy ending and a beautiful bonus Epilogue too.,OVERALL:¬† ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´/5 -all the stars,‚ñ™Ô∏éSpice Level:¬† üå∂üå∂üå∂.5/ 5,‚Ä¢Recommend: Yes,‚ñ™Ô∏éRe-read/re-listen: Aslo, yes!,‚Ä¢Trope: Single parents, fake relationship, forced proximity. Love After Loss.,‚Ä¢Narrator: üéßüéßüéßüéßüéß/5 - standing ovation,‚Ä¢ Thoughts:,I love and I mean love a Corrine Michaels book. I know when I pick up her books, I am getting a novel that is nothing short of perfection.. I have several favorites from this author, but Broken Dreams is easily my favorite now of all of Corrine's books. There was something that just hit differently for me in this book. I was engaged and didn't want to put this book down, so yes, it was completely done in a day.,I absolutely loved the banter that took place in the book. I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. Seriously, just add it to your TBR and make sure it's the next book you read.,The incredible Kit Swann and Sebastian York narrated the book. Hot diggity dog were they special together. They 100 percent made an already incredible story even more fantastic with their performance.  Just speechless. This book!!! ugh seriously nothing but amazing things to say about this book.,I love how Corrine has managed to interwoven characters from all of her series! I had no idea that Devny was Emmets cousin, there‚Äôs always a cameo, or a mention of characters we‚Äôve known and loved.,I‚Äôm glad that we find closure for Addison!!!! She truly deserved it! She comes alive in this book. Two mourners that become friends and build their relationship on trust and understanding.  I‚Äôm not going to say anything else. It‚Äôs a beautiful story, I laughed and I cried.,This book was absolutely perfect!! The story as well as narration completely made me fall in love!,This was a heartfelt love story and well written but not my favorite CM book.. She is one of my favorite authors, so talented with her ability to perfectly draw you in and keep you engaged.. This story was good but a bit uneventful and predictable. Still a great love story just not my favorite CM book! Sebastian York is audio gold but Kit Swann is just ok.,Corrine is my favorite author and I preorder every book.  Sebyo was  fantastic as always, but Kit Swans  voice was very whiny and her kid voices a struggle to listen to.  I would probably read the next book instead of listen if she narrates it.  I'm sorry to write this, but want to give an honest review.,This is such an enjoyable story - you can not love Grady and Addy! Two lost loves, two cute kids and you want this happy every after. Also, it was great to bring in the Arrowoods and hear from them again in this Whitlock family story. Then, Addy's family connection back in Rose Cannon, Oregon come to town, YES! You will love this story, however, the female narration...not a fan. I almost quit the audio book and went to ""paperback"". However, I love Sebastian York and he helped me get through. To me, Addison sounded like a long time smoker who quit, or she had breathing issues. Here's what's weird, all other female voices were well done. I am not a voice actor and this is a lovely story. Listen, enjoy, and post your thoughts. DON'T miss out because of me - Corinna Michael's, thank you!!,I enjoyed this book very much.  when a book is able to bring out different emotions it means it is doing what it is meant to.  I laughed, cried, got mad...Look forward to the others,Addie and Grady have both gone through heartbreak.  Grady,rescues Addie from a bad date.  Can Addie be the one who can,help Grady in his business?  What 2 precious children.,Can true love be found?,Although I spent a LOT off this book calling Grady an idiot‚Ä¶. He grew on me and got smart!!  Addie was/is perfect for him and their story made me laugh and cry.  It an amazing tale of love after loss that will keep you reading all the way through‚Ä¶ or listening which is what I did.,Excellent narrators..  great story.. I want more!!!,I absolutely adored this book. A wonderful follow on to Forbidden Hearts, which featured Grady's oldest Brother - Asher, finding love with Phoebe.,This is Grady's story a single Dad, widowed far too young, finding new love with Addison, who we originally met in Corinne's excellent Rose Canyon Series.,Lots of great cross overs with other characters from Rose Canyon, as well as many of the Arrowoods. Always love it when Authors bring in previous characters from other books that we have already read and loved.,This is wonderfully written, and brilliantly narrated by the always amazing SebYo, and the very talented Kit Swann.,A book I will happily listen to again and again."
Red Rising,"Fantasy,Adventure,Dystopian",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"THAT'S WHAT CONVESATION IS.,This is entertaining and it is smartly written. It starts out similar to Wool Or Silo. One reason this appeals to most people is the, can do attitude, of the main characters. The book starts with The Reds, who are the most oppressed group in the Universe, a Universe they do not even know exist. Once they do realize that they have been lied to all their lives, the odds against them seem unsurmountable. Many times I thought the author had really gotten his characters in so deep, he surly was not going to be able to get them out. It has been a long time since an author has been able to make me wonder how in the world things were going to turn out.,RULERS HAVE A TENDENCY TO DISLIKE THOSE WHO BREAK RULES.,Then the book turns a 180 degrees. What was a story about a primitive, downtrodden people changes to high tech. In the past when an author has done this to me they lose me. This time I stayed with it and enjoyed the ride.,PRICK LICK,The last half of the book is similar to Hunger Games with Greek Gods. I liked it a lot better and there where no whinny characters. This part of the book reminded me of the writing of Robert Reed. The only complaint I have is that I did think this section of the book went on a little too long. It was very entertaining for the most part, but  I was ready for them to finish the game, long before they did. When they do finish, it is a grand finale that you don't want to miss. I will be getting the sequel.,The narrator is excellent,CHEAT OR BE CHEATED.,,I don't remember the last time I stayed up all night to read a book, but this one had too much intensity too much momentum to put down.  I just had to finish.  Darrow's story is rich with memorable characters and emotion and had plenty of suspense.  It's one that I'll remember for a long time.  I can't wait for the second novel.,Tim Gerard Reynolds makes it come alive.  his accent brings the story a perfect edge and he does the wide variety of characters justice.,A must read.,First, let me say that the fact that this book was narrated by Tim Reynolds was a primary reason I took a chance with this story.  I was not disappointed in the least. The story is told in the first person, which I particularly enjoy, and begins with a very dark and hopeless setting for our main character and his family and people. Even though our main character, Darrow, is only 16 when the story starts, I would hardly call this a young adult fiction. There are some pretty gruesome moments but nothing that is out of bounds.,The beginning is a bit clunky as the author is setting the stage for our young hero, and confusing at times if you let your mind wander. However, once Darrow's path is set, the story moves along smartly. As Darrow is faced with challenge after challenge, he learns about sacrifice, compassion, patience, and qualities that leaders must have in order to overcome incredible adversity. He learns...,Brown is effective creating believable characters, both good and bad, that are complex and struggle with life and death choices. There are some lighthearted moments which help ease the tension, but not many. I've read some comparing this to Hunger Games, which is a stretch I believe.  Maybe some elements such as overcoming oppression and injustice but everything else is quite different.,Reynolds is at the top of the class in terms of quality narrators and bringing a story to life. Simply outstanding.,The story does end a little abruptly and clearly sets up the next story, but hardly detracts from the quality of the book. If you like epic fantasy yarns, and this one clearly sets up nicely for the remaining two books of this trilogy, you will enjoy this one. Most highly recommended.,Any additional comments?,This book was really hard to rate because it was well written, but it felt like a collection of YA book tropes.,Is it set in a Dystopian future? Why yes it is.,Is the main character avenging the tragic rebellious death of a loved one that happens to get played on TV? Well, now that you mention it, yes.,Does the main character have to attend a special school, where more than 70% of the students die in training (which is utterly ridiculous by the way)? How did you guess?,Is there a game in which the contestants fight each other to the death? Yes, there is.,Is the main character very cocky and smarter than everyone else, despite the fact that they are all better education than him? Yes, yes he is.,Name some more YA tropes and they are in this book.,Now if I had not read any other YA books in the last 5 years, this would probably be ranked as one of the best YA books ever written. However, there is just way too much, ""been there done that"" feeling when reading this. Which makes it an OK read but not great, and thus 2 stars, which means, ""It was OK"" per good reads.,20K+ ratings are believable - it's a great book.,All the reviews prior do a better job at explaining, so mine will be simple...,Logical, smart and creative world building.,Likeable characters. Good and credible twists and turns (for the vast majority of the time).,Excellent book.,Any additional comments?,What a tremendous series.  This was one of my favorite listens in a long time.  The first book starts off a little bit slow, but picks up the pace quickly and maintains it all the way through the end of the trilogy.,One of the biggest draws of this book, for me, was how deep and rich the character development was.  Each character is so multidimensional.  And the complexities of the characters' personalities are reflected very well in the dialogue and the plot.,The narration was one of the best I've heard.  I loved hearing TGR's representation of Darrow mature with the character over the course of the trilogy.,I highly recommend this book.  And the next two as well!,Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?,Yes. Already have. This book has everything a fantasy/sci-fi/dystopian lover could ever want.,What was one of the most memorable moments of Red Rising?,There were so many! I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice it to say, there are many ups and downs, lots of twists and plenty of tension to go around. The rise and fall of allegiances and friendships, betrayals and unswerving loyalties, is always surprising. Other than that, I guess I'm always a sucker for a good makeover...,If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?,A red son rises.,Any additional comments?,The only reason I didn't give Red Rising five stars (and maybe this isn't fair) but many elements of this novel seem cliche... like Hunger Games, Ender's Game, Sparticus and various classic mythologies thrown in a blender. Makes a very delicious smoothie though... Plenty in there to distinguish it from other dystopian works but enough similarities that it was a touch... banal? Still enjoyable. Still a thrill-ride.,My kids devour a lot of YA fiction. I read this to see if it would be something they would like, to scout the ground ahead. It is quick and fast. Seems to resemble the whole Harry Potter (school), Ender's Game (school/space opera), book:The Hunger Games|2767052] (kids fighting to the death dystopia), with just a dash of The Maze Runner and Divergent thrown in for sport. My kids will adore it. They are young enough to get past some of the clich√©s and SF short-cuts. But of course, they are only 13 & 14.,As far as BIG SF, I'm not quite convinced. It seems a bit too contrived, too packaged, too made for Hollywood optioning (write every book as if it is a blockbuster and make it a series for sure). I'm not quite sure if it will stand up, long-term, to the big ONES. I'm not sure if I need to make room on my top SF shelf next to Dune orThe Foundation Trilogy. But I will keep reading the series. I will give it tot the kids. It was fun. It was cotton candy.,I have over 300 books in my Audible library and this is the only book I've listen to twice. I look forward for the next books,The way these books captured my heart caught me completely off guard. I am not a Sci-Fi fanboy. I thought after the 1st few chapters that I knew how the whole book would play out. I was wrong. I am so elated with these books that I am crying. The only bad thing I cannot stop thinking about is that I heard they are going to make this book into a movie. A movie will in no way capture the heart of this book. A movie will ruin it. A TV series will be needed. Zero doubt in my mind.,Many good reviews drew my attention to this book, it didn't really sound like my thing to be honest but because of the reviews I thought I'll give it a go.,I wondered were it was going at the beginning and it wasn't griping me, but out of nowhere it did! I grabbed by the throat and wouldn't let go.,once it started it didn't stop the was never a slow moment in the book. the story may not have been the most original but the way it was told and the characters were. I think it was a new take on the story of Spartacus.,I thought it was brilliant and if you are stuck for a new book to listen to I would recommend Red Rising.,,I was listening to this book at 3am when I should have been sleeping instead.,Would you listen to Red Rising again? Why?,No, but I generally just listen to books once. There are just too many good ones to get through üòè,Who was your favorite character and why?,Easy , has to be Darrow. Very likeable character that you are always rooting for and hoping that he doesn't get consumed by his anger,,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Tim Gerard Reynolds ‚Äì was your favourite?,Fitchner - makes you laugh the way he does the character.,If you made a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?,Make gold bleed red,Any additional comments?,If you like the hunger games this one is for you. It's more sci fi in a good way. I'm reading the next book already...,Firstly, I did enjoy this story. It is well written and the dialogue worked for me with a couple of pivot points where the narrative could turn one way or another. That said, there's an awful lot of Ender on Mars here (Ender even gets a hat-tip in a line of dialogue) with a good chunk of Paul Atreides and some obvious allusions to Katniss' story. So much so, that it really began to annoy me in the middle section of the book.,The narrator is decent and clear but having the poor underclass speaking with Oirish accents and the cruel elite in mock RP is crass and hackneyed. There's a lot of dialogue and thankfully, the narrator doesn't quite sustain the level of shrieking he delivers in the first third.,This has been one of the most enjoyable books ever ! I absolutely loved the story, which had so many memorable moments. strongly recommended !,Absolutely brilliant,story gets better and better,brilliant character development, twists, surprises.,the anger and rage in the book is visceral!,,superb narration also,loved it. Read the book a while ago and thought I'd give it a listen.  an excellent telling of the story.,I wanna start off by saying that Tim Gerard Reynolds‚Äô narration was really good, and I‚Äôd listen to something narrated by him again in the future.,However, this story was just dull.,It started off really well, and I had such high hopes that this was gonna be an epic rebellion story. Maybe a more mature Hunger Games with a male MC. The world building, the way they manipulated Darrow‚Äôs physical appearance to infiltrate the elite, and his reasons for agreeing to it all, it was all great!,Then I hit about the half way point and things just stated to drag. Darrow‚Äôs time in the academy was just monotonous and repetitive and boring. I started to really dislike Darrow and he just became snivelling and dull, and I really wanted a passionate force of a MC. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. There was plenty of violence and brutality and gore, if that‚Äôs your thing. But for me, there just wasn‚Äôt enough emotion in it.,I stuck it out, as I thought the ending might have been worth all that bland in the middle, but it was very anticlimactic.,Unfortunately this one just wasn‚Äôt for me, although I know it‚Äôs a fairly well liked series, so could be for you!,Coming off the back of The Gentleman Bastards and First Law series I had big shoes to fill and this did just that. Only one book in but loved it and great narrative.,Here‚Äôs hoping the follow up books are as good!,Absolutely bloody mint, hooked from start to finish. Can't wait to listen to the rest of the series.,Best narration I have heard on audible.,I have had the pleasure of reading some very good books lately. But it has been a long time since a story utterly enveloped like Red Rising did. I found myself completely drawn into the story as the world around me evaporated just like in the scene from the Never-ending Story (that shows my age).,So what is it about this book that elevated it above all the other excellent books I have read recently. For me it was the completeness of the book. From the character development to the world it was set in. The author winds the narrative through it all and as he does the world becomes more and more real.,Red Rising tells a tale that's very essence is as old as time. It is how this tale is delivered that makes this book stand out in the crowd. Halfway through the read I was already planning how I could get my hand on the next book in the series. I have not done this for a long time and that indicated to me just how fantastic a read it was. The narraor adds another level to this book as well delivering one the best audible experiences I have had to date.,So my hat goes off to Pierce Brown for this truly masterful piece of writing. I recommend this book to all that are interested in being thoroughly entertained.,,I found the story well told and interesting. I found the character grew as the story developed. There was something close to real emotion in the book at times. Though the book has its flaws it worked for me and I will read (well listen) the next book ASAP.,However it is a little annoying how one character person can be so great, so brilliant. It is a common trait in fantasy for a character to be so excellent and essentially make decisions with such unerring accuracy that they can come up with the goods despite any set backs. A little less perfection may have made it a bit more realistic. I think he could put more into the secondary characters who some times seem a bit slim (though generally okay).,Gareth,,I nearly lost patience with the bleak beginnings, but so glad I didn't.,Where Dune meets Lord of the Flies on Mars.,I didn't think I was going to get along with this book at first but I soon got absorbed into the story and ended up thoroughly enjoying it.,I loved this book. The story, the characters, the performance. Couldn't recommend it more. A fantastic start to a brilliant trilogy .... It's Game Of Thrones / Hunger Games / in space,10/10,The narrator of this novel was great! It was a pleasure to listen to him, his delivery was fantastic.,,,Now, as for the plot: It really wasn't anything ground-breaking, but it was an easy read and had great pacing.,,The protagonist is a Mary Sue with little personality, but the dynamic he had with other characters was entertaining enough.,Pretty much all story elements have been explored in several well known novels and franchises before, but they came together pretty nicely in the end.,In some parts, the world building was a little lacklustre in my opinion, I would have liked to see more concepts explained and explored.,As such, plot holes and logical inconsistencies were ample, but I'm not sure if that's due to author oversight or exploration of these plot holes in later books of the franchise.,,So, if you're after something easy, yet suspenseful, Red Rising is a great choice - just don't think too hard about it.,,(Also, don't read this book if you're sensitive to blood / gore / brutality. Red Rising doesn't necessarily go overboard, but it doesn't exactly hold back either),For lovers of the greats, look no further.,Once you start you won't want to put it down.,give this a shot if you liked Hunger Games. i didnt like HG but really enjoyed this.,Given it's an audio book hard to ""put down"" doesn't sound quite right! Definitely clever to offer the first book free. Interesting story and characters you actually care about who have some depth to them .I've bought the next in the series already,very quickly grips you and doesnt let go until the last word. highly recommend it."
The Fall of Cadia,"Adventure,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Probably one of the best 40K novels I‚Äôve ever listened to. Robert Paints a realistic portrait of wartime Cadia from a smattering of places rooted in reality, and it shows. This is believable, and while tragic, has some heartfelt moments and more than a little bit of comedy that will make you grin like an idiot. Worth the read, every bit of the way. Cadia stands!,As a relative newcomer to the 40k universe, I‚Äôd heard the general gist of Cadia before, even of its final climactic encounters. But this novel lays it out in character-rich style that I was enthralled in to start-to-finish. I tend to struggle in keeping my attention to some 40k literature, which can devolve into unbearably one-note battle schlock if written without care, so I‚Äôve become pretty picky with my choices. This one broke the mold in every respect.,So much love was obviously put into the writing of this book. It‚Äôs a pleasure to read, even down to the author‚Äôs note at the end which reveals just how much this author was committed to getting this book right.,My only criticisms would be with the narrator‚Äôs voice for Abbadon. Maybe I‚Äôve become too acclimated to Keeble‚Äôs iron, rustic tones when he does Abbadon. This narrator makes him sound‚Ä¶like a demon with a too-deep, too-round voice. It was a bizarre choice, but not enough to put me off of it.,Highly, highly recommended.,5 out of 5, only sad part is a warlord titan did NOT show up on the flank of the chaos forces. Genuinely gripping story and narration! Its a long listen but I was sad when it ended.,Lol WTF did I  just listen to?,Hilariously mismatched voice acting for the ensemble of characters. Space Wolves sounding like The Wagner Group advising Putin, 900 year old decrepit women in power armor, Abbadon is narrated by Jabba the Hutt of Nurgle, constipation runs rampant when anybody is shouting and the list goes on. The writing itself is amazing, 5/5. The narrator clearly never got the memo that this is Warhammer 40k and not the Spellmonger series. 0/5 for performance purely because I kept forgetting I was listening to 40k.,I guess that in itself was pretty impressive from the narrator. Oh yea... and Darth Vader has a brief cameo.,Story is great and glad I got to see additional development for Trazyn in line with the author‚Äôs other work.,After listening to The Infinite and The Divine multiple times with a different narrator it was jarring to hear Trazyn portrayed so differently but once I got into the story this narrator did a great job with the characters, especially Creed, once I got over the initial differences in performance.,Elstob takes a lot of flak - rightly - for parts of his narration. Any Space Marine, Trazyn, and any female character just do not sound right. As someone else pointed out though, after a while you become inured to it and can focus on the story. The story is good! I enjoy the series of vignettes with a couple narratives that traverse the course of the book.,,In short, if you can get past Elstob, it's a good listen.,The little I was able to actually retain was great. The narrator completely ruined this book for me. Constantly distracted me with how bad the voices were. Probably a great narrator for non fiction reference books but his character voices were absolutely terrible. I hope they get another narrator and redo it. Sorry to be so harsh but it really ruined my experience. Hope he gets better and does well in the future but this was butchery.,I give this Audio Book all 3 5-Star Rating. It felt like a Terry Pratchet / Neil Gaiman novel ... a Good Omens kind of vibe; despite the 'all is lost' feeling about the event there was humor. The performance was great, the actor Black Library used to read the book gave it so much effort in bring to life the story, Mark used different voices to distinguish each character bring to them their own personality. He interpreted the characters and it was marvelous... Creed was confident and had it all under control and went out in a blaze of glory.,,This book also sees the conflict from the ""Big Picture' point of view; there is the Imperial Guards Planetarty Comander's point of view, the Necron's, Mechanicus of Mars, Chaos, Eldar, Sister's of Battle, and the Black Templars. Its really cool.. guys!,,Listen to it for the skill of the Narrator changing his voices to express an interpretation of the characters, and enjoy the humor, the grim dark 'smilling at death' humor as the apocalypse is happening and the Hords of Chaos is charging in at you. CADIA STANDS!,,Also, if you have:,,Cadia Stands in your audio book collection, this book will help you understand Creed's strategy and fills in the mystery.,,,Recorded fairly quietly. That is my only gripe. Otherwise it is an AMAZING story, very good setup and foreshadowing. I cried when certain characters fell and Creed is the best. CADIA STANDS!!,story is great. the narration was awful.  the character voices completely ruined the experience.,This story is one of the most amazing, important and critical to the 40k universe in recent history. The story itself is brilliant but, and it's a huge BUT... Mark Elstob needs to be stopped. His normal reading voice is completely fine but the moment he ""acts"" it becomes the worst experience possible. I feel like I go from grim dark to a local theatre panto. It's torture akin to Drukhari or Slaaneshi afternoon tea. Please, please, please stop giving this man anything over the narrator's role.,Gave up after an hour, what on earth are the accents, about? Could have been a great story but fails on a grand scale. I thought my phone was possessed, the,narrator needs to have a think next time. Shame on you GW for allowing this, roll on next months credit.,Really great story bringing together elements of the fall that I was not aware having not read the campaign books, mark elstob‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard to describe how poor his characterisations are, ok when just narrating but when he inflicts his voices on the listener it makes all these characters seem like naughty hysterical children,I can't comment too much on the story but it did seem to be building quite well. I just couldn't listen to the stupid voices the narrator was making for some of the characters. I don't mind the accents but the 'effects' he was trying to do are awful.,I didn't mind him reading Ahriman but he's out of place in a book like this. shame really.,But yes what everyone is saying about the voice actor is correct, don't get me wrong it works in some places  but others definitely not.,The writing, the performance, the scale, the descriptions, the drama, the laughs, the tears. everything was amazing. Fantastic book and very much hoping to hear from this writer and narrator again.,Also I didn't know the initial colony ship to Cadia came directly from Newcastle...,Whenever the narrator tries to do someone shouting it sounds like someone struggling to poop. The voices are just terrible. The story itself is pretty good.,Performance is terrible, pacing is terrible. The actual story is poorly laid out and it's just a simply a bad book. Disappointed to say the least. Save your money/token,I've never been able to stick with the Millitarum books..  thankfully this is so much more.,but I will agree with the other reviewers, the Narator is great at narration, but his voices for the different charactors, such as Abbadon simply don't fit -  this really needed Jonathan Keeble, since he's the man for the Black Legion books, it would have provided perfect consistency,,An absole marvel from start to finish, but the ending - the Foxhole Poem ending was truly one of the most brilliant and melancholic ways to end the story. I also loved the fact that the writer himself opened up about the inspirations and background for this book and I hope that other Black Library writers will do so themselves in the future ü•∞,good story, nice to see what happens everywhere. the narration grinded me a bit the voices of the characters just felt wrong and took a bit to get used to. but overall good listen,Great and engaging story with plenty of depth and tangents. Unfortunately the Voice acting takes away from the story. The voice acting is not unbearable but does distract from an otherwise excellent story.,Story seems good but the voice actor is so bad it's distracting. will refund for now,,A nice, long, very solid story that is almost entirely RUINED by horrendous voice acting for virtually every character. Chapters that should be great are a slog to get through. Some characters are almost impossible to understand. Narrator's... well, narration voice is fine, but his portrayal of characters is unfortunately terrible.,VA makes everyone sound like whining babies the whole time. While I enjoy the story it makes it hard to enjoy when everyone sounds like they are more at home in a wallace and gromit movie."
The Rules of Dating My One-Night Stand,Contemporary,Romance,"Please let Sebastian read all male lines! His voice is so manly. He even does a better job at female lines than girl reading male lines.,This story was a typical Vi and Penelope story. Started off really slow then progressed. The story had some funny moments but it just didn't mesh with me. The female narration was way to high pitch and her male voice was annoying.  Sebasti√°n York was great hints the 3 üåü.  The first and second books were much better.,Shocked this was a vi book. The characters were lame, the story was unbelievable and dragged. I put the cadence on double and just wish I wouldn‚Äôt have finished it. Not worth a credit and I never thought I would say that about a vi book.,Just finished listening. And of course the narration was phenomenal as usual from these narrators. The story was OK. There wasn‚Äôt anything I hated about any of the characters. I just didn‚Äôt feel that pull between the two leads that you would expect to feel. And honestly, the storyline felt like a retread of a lot of things I‚Äôve read before‚Ä¶re-organized maybe into something new, but just not what I was looking for. That being said, the writing was great as usual from these authors and it‚Äôs probably just a bit of what I‚Äôm looking for versus what the story is. Big Spoiler: this is a love triangle with a surprise baby story‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôd had an idea of that going in I might not have bought it.,This is a kid/baby focused story which is NOT mentioned in the summary, my least favorite troupe. The heroine‚Äôs character was not formed enough for me to care about her. Which made the fact that two men loved her very unrealistic. The authors do write good steamy scenes which plays out as maybe the reason the hero is attracted to her in the first place. Typical story nothing special. Narrators were good.,,Penelope Ward and Vi Keeland are two authors I already know and love writing as a dynamic duo or individually, so I knew this was going to be a great story. However, this story wasn‚Äôt just great.. it was packed full of emotional highs and lows, push and pulls, rocky roads littered with feels and a tight group of best friends who supported Devyn and Owen, gave them great advice and had their back no matter what. It‚Äôs an (off book) one night stand who unexpectedly meet again in a plot that‚Äôs got its few sexy times but certainly isn‚Äôt drown out by them. There‚Äôs heart and heavy and humor as this caring supportive hero proves he‚Äôs all in as the emotionally overloaded heroine struggles with choices and feelings, trust issues, family drama and responsibilities.. and an unplanned surprise. Then, pair all that deliciousness up with the fantastic voice acting by Sebastian and Vanessa, and you‚Äôve got an easy on the ears compelling listen. With a hero and heroine you‚Äôre going to love as you root for them on their torn journey as the years of baggage gets lifted, as their romance slowly builds and builds and as the roadblocks eventually all lead to a very sweet and happy ending. Great secondary characters too.,,Worth a credit? Yes, it‚Äôs an emotionally conflicted story that‚Äôs full of charm and I couldn‚Äôt wait for the rainbow at the end of their difficult journey.,I‚Äôve read almost all the books written by both authors. They are both favs of mine. I love this series. However, I felt like this book fell short. I wish they would‚Äôve went into more detail about the ‚Äúone night stand‚Äù they had. Like I felt like the MCs didn‚Äôt have that explosive chemistry they wanted us to believe they had. Like this amazing night they swear happened didn‚Äôt roll over into this relationship that was formed.,This story was beautiful, definitely worth the read!!,How to survive a hardship and make it a love story!,I love everything  that  Sebastian York does. He makes every story so great!  Can‚Äôt wait for their next story!,I realized at one of the ending scenes of them together, that there weren‚Äôt many moments where you really felt their connection. I was surprised the book was ending because I would have thought that there would be more moments of them growing their love together, instead of just managing the issues. I love the narrators and how they portrayed the characters, I think that made up for some of the lost moments of their connection.,She leaves the MC on while still keeping the door open for her friends with benefits open.. she tells the MC she‚Äôs his girlfriend yet doesn‚Äôt correct the friend when he talks about moving in and being a family.. I found this book frustrating and couldn‚Äôt wait to end it.,Disappointed I use a credit on it. Authors have better books!,Let me just say the reason I decided to listen this book was Because I love Sebastian Yorks voice. Anytime i listen to an audible book when its paired With something from Vi catalog you know, it's gonna be good and this one, It did not disappoint. I loved every minute of it i was never bored and it never lost me at any point in time. it started out just slow enough to get to interested but not bored And the drama is well-timed. Nothing in the story was useless information and it was not overwrriten . Props to the other Author I don't know who she is but afternoon this afternoon I'm  gonna know who SHE IS.   I love the book. I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone so read it yourself, but it's really good.,What a,fabulous story with such great characters the narrator s voices were great to,This is the third book in the series and so emotional and funny this story has everything,So looking forward to the next in the series x,This was a DNF for me.  Just too much repetitive thoughts/dialogue. Not even my favourite narrators could make me listen to the end. Threw in the towel with 4 more hours to go,Once again another great book.. romance, friendship, humour, family and suspense. Cannot wait for the last of the friend's stories. So good... Thank you."
He Who Fights with Monsters 4,"Action & Adventure,Fantasy,Epic,Urban",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Listen im an American and im also a marine corps vet... I see alot about this book hinting towards racism and anti American propaganda in the reveiws... first thing is first... its a story a very well written story, it doesn't matter where you stand on politics... the only racism I seen had to do with the way his mother treats people... and just in case many of you don't actually know a lot of other countries hate our government because our government is pretty irredeemable at this point and unless you've worked in the government you stand absolutely no chance at changing my mind... most countries do like the American people and our values but our government as a whole sucks... so it's the absolute truth when he said what he said and his cheap shots were completely valid... along with the fact that we knew from the start MC doesn't like government figures of any kind... this book... hell this series is amazing and it is beautifully performed. I hope to see what comes of his niece in the future and I can't wait for him to rank up again but I'm here for the journey and the lighting fast quips. I absolutely need more!,Overall I hate leaving bad reviews but I can't deny that this book feels like a step back in writing and character development story wise. I am glad there's a continuation and more to the story as well as we get to visit Jason's home and family, especially his niece, there's just not much substance or progression in this 4th book.,I gave it 3 stars though honestly I'm not sure I would have given it that if not for the voice actors performance. A lot of the new characters are enjoyable though rather side stepped at certain points leaving them feel at times one dimensional without any of their own sense of urgency. In part my feelings stem from re-reading the first three books again and in comparison to the other books this book doesn't spend as much time developing characters as much as it just comes off as a rough draft for a screenplay.,By the end of this book I couldn't tell if the author was trying to convince the reader or themselves that they need to go on their own walkabout before finishing this series. I mean if you're going to critique the end of the game of thrones tv series, which everyone agrees was rushed, you could have written a more developed and substantial homecoming that took into more consideration the experiences and character development from the first three books. and I get that that's a rather harsh criticism to level but I just believe Shirtaloon can and has done better with the previous books and I will still look forward to more in the series.,Can't wait to enjoy this story more! Best litrpg series to date! Well worth the listen.,I love this series. The third book ended on a brilliant (and tragic) cliffhanger - one I couldn‚Äôt begin to resolve on my own - so I‚Äôm up and listening to book 4 as soon as it came available (at 2am local time, lol). I‚Äôm already eagerly awaiting the 5th installment.,About the most clever thing Shirtaloon did throughout this book was to wait until nearly the end to unveil that he's been stricken by the same malady of many current ""popular"" fiction authors: This almost pathological insistence that their personal real-world political opinions are somehow necessary, desired, or more inherently profound than that of literally anyone else, therefore they MUST share them directly with you the reader. Plot be damned.,If you've managed to  finish this almost entirely pointless entry into the series,  you'll know exactly what part I'm referencing. Shirtaloon takes the absolute minimal effort setting up a scenario where he's able to launch into a sudden diatribe against real world political figures (entirely divorced from any plot relevance), with all the intellectual gumption of a toddler's bowl movement. It's so unnecessary and out of place it's absurd. Let me elaborate.,The author sets up some hasty caricatures of government officials from both America and China, in which he praises, for literally no reason, his invented Chinese delegates, mostly because one of them is a hot young woman (I guess?). Then he pivots nearly immediately to a meeting with the hastily constructed strawman of a stuffy white ""American guy"", where he demonizes him and America to a nearly comical degree, complete with a ham fisted Donald Trump rant. It's so bad, I literally quit listening and I'm not sure I'll be finishing the few hours left in this audiobook. Hell, I'm not sure I'll be finishing this series.,Typically this sort of turn into politically progressive virtue signaling is chronic and terminal. I'll hold out hope, but I'm not optimistic Shirtaloon will recover. It's seems once this cancer starts, the urge to shoehorn in real-world political hot-takes only gets worse. I'm fully expecting the Book 5 to go full on ""Ready Player Two"", and you fellow reader should be as well.,HONEST REVIEW,First of all the people rating 4 star and 5 stars are complaining about the book, drop the stars to 3 or and honest 2 and things with change the author does read reviews unless the rating are low and true for this book.,A lot of people are calling this a filler book no its book 4 its just really bad, very little action mainly take about morals and whose right or wrong and Jason has a huge problem going on a rant about what ever then at the end of the rant say whose knows if I'm right I could be wrong. EVERTIME IT SEEMS,Then the weird thing he does with his niece.,This is a masterpiece. We get to see the origin of Jason and learn about why he is how he is. Also with some casual awesomeness. Truly this is the turning point in the series where Jason starts becoming a legend while also foreshadowing some crazy things for book 5.,So the author horribly places current time politics and public sentiment all throughout his book so much to the point that It completely ignores the most important thing about a Fantasy book. That being that it is a Fantasy book. He over reaches into every area looking to broaden acceptance.,I am not one to see or care about it but when the character is donning  the mantle of Savior of all humanity but then refuses to help America because of their arrogance but helps the country that has tried to kill him multiple times and toured his dear friend. well that means the author just wanted to say screw you to all Americans.,Book 1 and 2 were very well written and gave alot of promise to the series. book 3 had ALOT of lazy writing which made it a weak addition and hard to finish. Book 4 leaks small political ideals of the writer I tend to hate in books. Small subtleties meant to make characters more complex with more depth,  instead it makes them all seem too similar. Don't get me started on how the women in the books interact. There are only 2 personalities for female characters. Sophie, Anna, and Erica read so much alike you couldn't tell them apart with out the ending dialog.,I end up listening to them withing 2 days of release and then have to wait for the next book!,,Seriously though great books.,It took its time getting back into the story i was expecting more hopefully book 5 will pick up better.,I hoped this book would focus more on the story arc we knew but I suppose I will have to wait for that.,Cheers to the burp at 09.24 in chapter 44.,The whole series is fantastic. Great story, amazing depth of character and excellent narration. I repeatedly found myself laughing out loud. Thoroughly entertaining throughout. Can‚Äôt wait for the next instalment.,How long till the next installment? April for the kindle edition, so I may have to join the patrion,Want book 5. 6, 7, etc‚Ä¶.  Come on get going that pen an‚Äôt smoking yet.,I have even decided to re listen for the book 5 release. I love this series and aspesiali the way it is narrated the personality oft the main character is shown in full,,This volume was good but spent way too long on the MC smugly rubbing his powers in the face of family, old friends, and acquaintances. It was fun at first but after a while got very repetitive.,In this book, we'll finally learn more about Jason family, his world, and how he was hurt by his brother a long time ago,Jason might be the most unlikable char out there. if the author could stick to fantasy and story it would be decent. but the way the author makes jason spew out all the liberal garb takes in rants,doesnt sit well with me. im here to get lost in story not to get force fed political agendas. Could just aswell listen to a political podcast instead. Its a shame like the format of the powers and world. but not the virtue signalling,A great series from beginning to end. As an Australian the material was even more relatable. Full of humor, action, fantasy and emotions. The main character is annoying and loveable at the same time. I had a lot of laugh out loud moments through out the whole series so far. For the frequency that Shirtaloon pumps out these gems its surprisingly well written and cohesive. The performances by the reader are perfectly suited to the style as well the way he verbally contorts himself between characters is amazing. I recommend these books to anyone looking for a great escape from reality. 10 out of 10.,I am still enjoying the story but DAMN the personality of Jason was really starting to annoy me by the end of the book. The other books i have read in the kindle app so i can skim over the long sequences of sarcastic smug conversations or the rambling of 80's tv shows but this time i bought the audio book and i was struggling with it by the end of the book. there were times when they spent what felt like 5 min straight of the audio book talking about tv shows and i wanted to just sikp over it to advance the bloody plot. I think it is even worse with his sister\family in this one, they all seem to have varing degrees of jason's sarcastic personality but thankfully toned down to a more human level. Maybe it was because i went through the audio book in like 4 days but it was really annoying by the end.,i enjoyed the plot but it did seem to drag alot. i am pretty sure large parts of the story have already been written but if the author can tone down jason's smart ass personality, for lack of a better term, i would enjoy that.,i am interested in where the story will go from here. The performer did a great job with the different characters and accents.,overall i enjoyed this book, a change of pace\setting from the others keeps the story fresh, i would have enjoyed the author exploring jason's interactions with the family members he dosen't get along with a bit more than all the time that is dedicated to his sister an niece, like his mum and brother an ex gf, there are moments but they seem short and unexplored compared to the other family relationships.,anyway thats my 2 cents,This series just keeps getting better! Brilliant concept and great narration. Love having an Aussie reading an Aussie book too.,Great story, awesome to here something that's not American centric. Really look forward to the next book.,hesitant woth the ""change"" at first but was pleasantly surprised it grew on me as fast as it did.,Honestly, this series brings me so much joy.  It makes me laugh out loud, cry real tears and replay quotes over and over until I‚Äôm sure I have written them down correctly.  The main thing I wanted to say was a huge thank you to Travis and Heath for bringing this world and it‚Äôs characters to life.  It has been getting me through some of my worst days.  Next book already preordered üíú,I did like it wished it was longer but I don‚Äôt know something was kind of missing, maybe it is the fact I‚Äôm use to more monsters or I‚Äôm use to the rest of the team but yeah. Can‚Äôt wait for book 5,Jason's latest shenanigans are highly enjoyable and the whole book was so well done!,great read! and bloody great  lemonade!!!!!,More Brilliance from Shirtaloon.,awesome worldbuilding and  story development, great pacing more books please.,,great progress in the story. witty, charming and action packed. highly recommended, can't wait for the next one"
Outlander,"Fantasy,Historical",Romance,"I downloaded this book years and years ago and settled down to a 30+ hour listen.  Based on many raving reviews I thought the book was a time travel tale of beloved fiction. There was so much about the book that I knew I would enjoy.  The time travel, the Scottish highlands, medicinal herbs, life hundreds of years ago, gardening...the list goes on.,However, I have to state up front I hate romance novels.  At the half way point I had the sudden realization--I know I'm quick-- that this book was a dreaded romance novel.  I was horrified and had heard enough of what Jamie wore or didn't wear under his kilt to last me forever.  The heaving bodices were weighing me down as well. This was before Audible allowed returns of hated books.  So I shelved the book with a shudder, gave up, and it sat there in my library untouched for years.,Fast forward to last month when the Outlander cable program started and I watched just to see what it was like.  Well--to my shock--it is wonderful.  The filming, the setting, the costumes--all fantastic.  So I'm listening again with renewed interest.  I cringe a bit every now and then to be honest.  But I am enjoying the book at long last.  I can see what those positive reviewers were about.  Living proof that if you don't like a book give it time.  You might like it after all.,I had read a few audiobooks and had even joined Audible.  But until I read this book I did not understand the magic of the format.  Before reading this book I had no interest in1) romance 2) science fiction or fantasy and 3) time travel genres.  I'd heard enough about the series that it piqued my interest because I loved historical fiction.  Especially the period of time I knew the book covered.  And I always found the challenge of tackling a big book rewarding.,This book changed so many of my perceptions of genre and reading format.  While I still argue that though there is definitely a romantic and sexual relationship at the books core, it was only one part of the adventure.  It still doesn't fit the romance genre to me, but it did such a good job of weaving romance and sexuality into the adventure it made me curious to read more traditional romance novels and see if they handled the topic as well.  They didn't, but I discovered other good books I never would have tried of not for Outlander.,Likewise, other than Anne Rice's Vampire series which I had read many years ago, this was one of my very rare ventures into fantasy-science fiction.  Setting aside my understanding of reality to accept someone else's is always difficult.  But reading Outlander and the subsequent books in the series, I found myself trying to work out in my mind how this might have happened.  It encouraged me to explore this genre more thoroughly as well.  Even more surprising, it made me evaluate my perception of ""time"", what it means and how it works.  I found myself paying more attention to physics and the study of the time and space relationship.,The twists and turns of the plot kept me turning the page just like the best mysteries I read.  While reading the book there were enough unanswered questions, clues and short glimpses of scenes or events that caught my attention and made me store them away to remember ""when all was revealed.""  But all was not revealed at the end and I found myself turning over these clues and snippets, trying to determine their significance,  what I thought they meant and what their purpose was.  One requirement of a great book is that you cannot get it out of your mind after you turn the last page.  This book met that criteria.  I thought about it for weeks.,Most importantly I learned that other voices can bring a whole new level to the reading experience, if it is the right voice for the right book.  I would have enjoyed this book regardless, but if I read it myself and heard my voice in my head the characters would never have come so alive as they did in Davina Porter's voice.  This is a perfect marriage of book and narrator.  I was so surprised when I later discovered more about Porter's age, experience and background.  She made a 21 year old Scotsman come to life.  Her voice is Jamie to me.  She handled each character wonderfully, although it is the first and only time I have ever listened to a book or series of books and thought a woman narrator did a better job on the men's  voices than she did on the women's.  I have loved hearing how the narrator has aged the character's voices throughout the series.  You hear the young Jamie in the middle aged Jamie's voice, but you also hear the growth and maturity.  I have accepted the narrators in the Lord John series, even when the book includes Jamie and actually think they are narrated well.  But I am not certain I could accept another narrator for future Outlander books.,Finally, my initial interest in this book was from a historical fiction viewpoint.  A good historical fiction novel, by Bernard Cornwell or Sharon Kay Penman sticks to as much historical fact as possible but presents it in an engaging and relate-able format.  It makes you interested enough in the times and events that you will endure the dry-er, less lively recitation of facts of that same event or time in a nonfiction book, just to learn more.  Outlander and this series delivered that in spades.,,This book was written by a woman for women.  About 15% of this book is graphic romance from the woman's perspective.  Men listening to these sections will find the discussion extremely boring if not nausiating.  These sections are not pornography, but by being graphic and explicit, come close enough to be annoying. During these sessions, the book becomes a Harlequin Romance, and the main character becomes Fabio-like.  This greatly distracts from the story-line and will drive many males away from the book.,,So why did I give this book a 4 star rating?  Because the rest of the story is compelling, the reader is excellent, and the characters have depth and realism during the non-Fabio moments.  The author takes pains to be historically accurate, and if one has visiting Scotland, the descriptions are enjoyable and vivid.,,Be warned, however, that this is not science fiction.  Time travel is a mechanism, not a concept in this book.  As the author herself admitted at her website, this happened by accident, and she simply went along with it.  So dont get this book if the goal is to explore the ramifications and paradoxes of time travel.  Such topics are explored superficially in the second book, and ignored here.,,If one wants a great time travel story, I recommend To Say Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis.,i have 4 things to say about this book:,,1. the narration is excellent,2. the romance is...very romantic,3. the history is...fun,4. the ""naughty"" stuff is...(see below),,it's common for romance novels, especially ones that appeal to medieval European settings, to bring in sexually charged themes of bondage, whipping, and nonconsensual intercourse.  this book goes rather SO far in that direction, though, that it distracts from the otherwise dignified plot.,,Below is an abbreviated breakdown of the action, just to let you know just how kinky things get.,,MH=Male Hero / MF=Female Heroine / MV=Main Villain / V=Villain,,1) MV threatens to force himself onto FH,2) random V's threaten to force themselves onto FH,3) MV whips MH and forces himself onto MH's sister,4) 2 V's force themselves on FH in front of MH,5) MV forces himself on FH in front of MH,6) MH whips FH (gives her a ""strapping""),7) MV tortures MH,8) MV forces himself on MH (!!!),9) FH pretends to be MV in (non-psychologist approved) reenactment of #8 designed to ""cure"" him of his shame (?!),,and all of this in lurid detail, with a great deal of time spent recalling past whippings and beatings and tortures.  not sure how all this made it past the editor, but...,,at least now you're warned, and there is a good story and some good writing buried in there!,,I bought this audiobook because it was in the sci/fi fantasy category.  The write up claims it has ""a dash of time travel"" - and that's all it has in the way of fantasy/time travel - a dash.,,Time travel is used as a way to launch a HISTORICAL ROMANCE. And, ultimately, this is exactly what it is: a very detailed romance novel set in 18th century Scotland.,,Keeping that in mind: it is VERY well done.  The narration is terrific and the story engaging (though I did use the fast forward several times to get through the long descriptions of clan family lines, or details of the clothing/housing/etc of the time).,,I don't like romances and I don't like historical fiction so I thought the two together would mean I had wasted my credit.  Not so.  Even though it's as far from my usual listening choices (sci/fi or cop/detective stuff) as it could be, the story flew by: I caught myself smiling at events in the story pretty regularly.,,Assuming a starting point of 3 stars for an average story, I added one star for the narration (which brings the story to life) and a second star for making me smile in public.  I took off a half star for requiring me to fast forward some of the descriptions = 4.5 star story.  So I give it 5 stars because 4.5 is not possible.  (I did buy the next book in the series too.),,Remember though, this is a romantic novel with some/lots of sex (though having made it through the sex scenes in Altered Carbon, this is pretty ""romantic"" sex) - so if you're looking for sci/fi or fantasy, you will be disappointed in this.,,Otherwise... if you're not the romantic type but, like me, stumble onto this story by accident only to find that you like it - don't worry, we won't tell anyone...,,,This IS NOT A SMUTTY ROMANCE BOOK. By any reasonable standards! But Ive been Shocked to see the neg reviews calling this incredibly famous novel just that.,*****A tip for the prude or those who aren't interested in love stories: read the description before you get the book. If you can't stand any mention of sexuality, or cant understand and appreciate the story of two lovers amidst tragedy of war and time, don't purchase a 32-hour, time-travel, Scottish romance novel.,Considering all the positive reviews, I rated this book, but never wrote a review bc it was all said already.  This is a beloved novel, and it is also a beautiful work of literature that will stand the test of time. I am obviously not the only one to think that.,The reason I write this review is in response to the readers who call this a silly romance, a piece of smut, or overly and offensly sexual. Oh my God! I can't imagine anyone thinking there was too much sex or graphic sex in this book. Moreover, I was annoyed for the first 15 hours that there wasn't more love and romance. This author writes the few love scenes with grace and tenderness, choosing precise words that are not offensive in the least. The few major intimacy scenes are brilliant, in fact. Diana Galdaldon was able to convey the intensity of the moment without resorting to brash language.,I wanted More time for the lovers to talk and get to know each other, mentally and physically. Thus I gave the story 4 stars instead of 5. But I still gave the overall a 5, because it was excellent.,It actually both angers and scares me that anyone is so sexually repressed that they think this PG novel is too sexy or smutty. Of all the fantasy novels I've read, excluding Harry Potter :), and of all the romance novels I've read, the sexuality is mild, to put it lightly. There are some wonderful scenes, and they are needed and important as part of the story. But as I said, these are written with precision to avoid offensive language.,So to anyone who fits the uptight mold I describe- start looking for your fantasy books in the kids section.,,Not that this series needs one more great review, but if you are still on the fence about giving it a try, I would urge you to do so. I'm a 3rd year doctoral student, overwhelmed with work and obligations, and quite literally the only thing that gets me excited about my 45-mile commute to school each morning is Davina Porter's amazing voice bringing to life Diane Gabaldon's epic adventure/romance story. I miss these characters when I'm away from them for too long - it's that good!! I've read a few comments about these books being too long, but I love them so much that I'm grateful to get to spend this much time with them. It should time out that I will get my degree right as I'm finishing the last book (I only listen on my commute so they last), and I intend to start them all over again when I do. They are simply that good.,My mother was a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon's work when I was growing up and I had always blown it off as a silly interest of my mother's like most kids. I'm 23 now and I thought I'd give it a try to see what all the fuss was about. I was so surprised to find out that my mother had great taste in books.. if not other things :) The idea of a woman going back in time to Scotland in the 1700's and falling in love with a highlander sounds kind of ridiculous, right? Well I was wrong, it was fantastic! There is a real story line here with genuine problems unlike some other 'romance' novels I have read. The sex scenes are tasteful and do not overpower the story. It isn't all love either, there is plenty of fighting even to keep my macho brother entertained. The places, historical events, tools, and lifestyles portrayed in the novel seem very well researched. The narration is excellent. Davina Porter has a very believable highland accent. I would highly recommend this book!,I was skeptical at first, my fiance picked this book for me and after reading the description, I wasn't eager to listen. I even teased him a bit about the time travel element.,,After exhausting my credits for the month, I grudgingly started Outlander and I am so happy I did! Oh my goodness! I could not believe how much I loved the book. I was drawn into this amazing story and the lives of all the characters. Diana Gabaldon paints a wonderful picture and Davina Porter is a fabulous narrator. I love that you know who is speaking before she even tells you.,,I have listened to all 7 books without stopping to take a breath in between. Having just finished the last book in the series, I feel a little empty, like something is missing. I have been trying to pick a new book, but I feel a bit like I am cheating on Jamie and Claire.,,My fiance, needless to say has been enjoying my addiction and has not missed an opportunity to say ""I told you so!"".,,,I was looking for something long because I have a lot of mindless chores for a week or two, and I like to be mentally somewhere else when that happens. It is long. I was looking for something light for the same reason. But the reviews and description I read of this one never did tell me what I was buying. This is a romance-novel, bodice-ripping, soft-porn excursion with little plot and less character development. I know women who like Harlequin romances and the like. If you do, you will probably like this one. But I'm bailing on it. I'm not interested in 20 more hours of near-rapes and outdoor sex, punctuated by saber fights.,This series is a mixture of science fiction, history, medicine and romance.  Forget historical or geographic accuracy.  This is escape and should be taken as fiction based on fact. Diana Gabaldon wrote this as an exercise and did it extremely well, even though she had never visited Scotland before writing Outlander.  It is thought provoking, funny, sad, erotic and dramatic.,There are, to date, six books in the series following the Frasers from Culloden (and the lead up to it) to the beginning of the War of Independence in America. There is one or possibly two more books to come.,Ever wondered where certain ideas came from?  Who thought of putting phosphate on bits of wood with an air proof covering? Could have been someone who had already seen the idea in action.,I thoroughly enjoyed the books and Davina Porter is an excellent narrator.  She manages to capture a 1940's English female accent but still does a very good Scottish male voice. Quite an achievement and well worth listening to.,What would have made Outlander better?,The story gets the narration it deserves. Both are tedious and more Mills and Boon (I imagine as I haven't read any) than serious historical novel. A possibly good idea is interrupted by so much sex and ""oooohhhhh Jaaaammmmieeee"" that it never really gets a chance. I did listen right through to the end, even though I wanted to stop half way, and have masochistically even gone part way through the second book, thinking it may improve, which it didn't. If anything it got worse. Unfortunately I bought three of this series at the same time on the basis of other reviews, but just couldn't face any more of this tedious drivel.,Would you ever listen to anything by Diana Gabaldon again?,Emphatically not!,Would you be willing to try another one of Davina Porter‚Äôs performances?,Highly unlikely.,If you could play editor, what scene or scenes would you have cut from Outlander?,About 60% of it.,Any additional comments?,I can honestly say that nothing I have read has annoyed me more than this series.,I thoroughly enjoyed this. Being a bloke I was looking for a nice time travel adventure but I soon got caught up in the thrills and spills of highland life without missing the real reason for choosing the book. The first couple of chapters drag a bit but keep close attention as they make historic references picked up later on. I was fascinated and enthralled!,I found this painful to listen to. Firstly the reader speaks as though she is the Queen, which I found really off-putting at times. Secondly, the chapters before the time travel drag on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.... and they go into so much boring detail about things that no-one could possibly be interested in. It also included some of the most excrutiatingly embarrassing and unsexy sex scenes.,I thought once the time travel happened, I would be embarking on a thrilling historical romp. I was sorely disappointed. It was more of the interminable detailed descriptions of the most boring events and more of the awful sex scenes.,Dreadful!,I actually fell for the 5* reviews on this book and feel like a bit of a fool for doing so.  This really is ""chick lit"" and quite poor at that.  The story is historically very weak indeed and is really aimed at female titillation because every other scene revolves around sex and, to be honest, it's so damned boring!  What's more it has the clich√©d goody v baddy storyline that has been done to death since time immemorial.,It took so long to get going that I almost gave up on it on three or four occasions. It's a shame really because when it did get going it was actually quite good but for 70% of the time it wasn't.  If it wasn't for Davina Porter's amazing narration I don't think I'd have stuck it out til the end. Without her wonderful voice the whole thing would've ground to a halt rapidly.,To put it in the sci-fi/fantasy section is a bit misleading because the only thing that is faintly related to this genre is the initial time slip.  With a bit of imagination from the author we could've really been put into the excitement and terror of a 20th century woman suddenly finding herself in the 18th century but instead we have a main character that knew exactly how to behave and speak from the start and was all too accepting of her situation.,Because the times where the story got moving were quite good I give it 3*s but for the most part it was a load of tosh and I certainly shall not be listening to any more of the series!,A page turning bodice ripper with added pornography.  The book started off ok but I found the increasing dominance of the sex scenes became boring.  Definitely written to appeal to women rather than men - my husband couldn't stand it and gave up on the first book.,I acquired this as the free title in a 3 for 2 offer. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it!,Be very careful, the sample is taken from the sensible start of the book.,I only managed half of it - 16 hours of sex and violence fantasies are more than enough for me.,If your idea of fun is a huge 18th century be-kilted Scotsman being beaten and having sex incessantly, this may be for you.,,Having read the books many years ago as they were written, I thought it would be interesting to listen to the first one being told.  It was very quickly addictive and many things went by the wayside until I finished listening to the story.  Davina Porter was very good, however, I agree with the reviewer who commented on her Scottish voices. I am Scottish, and the accents did grate slightly.  However I appreciate the difficulties in being female and trying to narrate in an 18th century male Highlander voice. Overall, very entertaining, and very enjoyable. I look forward to listening to the others.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,Some degree of historical reality/accuracy is useful in a historical novel,.,What was most disappointing about Diana Gabaldon‚Äôs story?,Lacked any depth, just a bodice ripper using a historic setting - the Scottish highlands. No conception or the era or realistic characterization.,Did Davina Porter do a good job differentiating each of the characters? How?,No. Heroine, ""oh gosh, I've time travelled, never mind."",You didn‚Äôt love this book--but did it have any redeeming qualities?,No redeeming features for me.  A big error.  Thought it may be interesting and a little different. It was certainly different to anything I would spend time listening to.,Any additional comments?,My mistake, but perhaps it should have been made clearer in the blurp that this was a shallow bodice ripper in Mills and Boon gendre and should be avoided by all but those of a certain gender and age.,The time travel concept made the book sound promising.  However, the lack of knowledge of the geography of Scotland and other Scottish themes made some of the listening laughable.  So much extraneous detail made for extremely long listening, resulting in impatience ""to get on with it!""  Less sex, less words and more actual story could have saved this novel...perhaps!,What would have made Outlander better?,not sure there was anything that would make it better, i just didn't like the interminable sex (yeah i get it, they were hot for each other) unbelievable close scrapes and escapes for Claire, and Jamie the superhero surviving beating after beating. just toooooooo much.,What could Diana Gabaldon have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you?,obviously lots of people really like it and the series ‚Ä¶ why should she change it for me?,What didn‚Äôt you like about Davina Porter‚Äôs performance?,Davina was fine, is was the content,If you could play editor, what scene or scenes would you have cut from Outlander?,most of them‚Ä¶but particularly the escape of Claire from the prison only to land in a pit full of bodies, then get attacked by wolves, which she kills single handed (NO weapon) then gets picked up by some dude who wanted to marry Jamies mother way back when‚Ä¶ oh dear, REALLY?!?!?!,Any additional comments?,obviously I accidentally chose a genre that i really don't like, but i did go on the many many previous reviews‚Ä¶.almost 100% positive ‚Ä¶ so maybe its just me‚Ä¶.,What didn‚Äôt you like about Davina Porter‚Äôs performance?,I couldn't pair the narrator's voice with the character - the narrator's voice felt too old and stuffy to be the young, headstrong Claire. I couldn't keep on with this audiobook after the first 3 hours. I have now read the book in its normal written format and loved it, but still cannot bring myself to return to the audiobook version as narrated by Davina Porter. Sorry Davina, it's not you, it's me!,I found it unbelievable the voice actor sounded much older than the main people's perspective and it just kept me back from sinking in to the book. she had a lovely voice and it was pleasant to listen to. I just couldn't merge the book and the voice. But it did sound like a good story, what I got through. so listen to the sample and if you like her voice give it a try!,the narrating was ok, the background out of sync echo when listening on headphones is very distracting and the random coughing throughout in the background is also off-putting, I found myself tuning in to the background.,What did you like most about Outlander?,I absolutely love the story and I can't wait to get into the next book in the series. I also love the Narration by Davina she is very believable with all the various characters.,What did you like best about this story?,I love the time traveling and of course the love story between Claire & Jamie,,Have you listened to any of Davina Porter‚Äôs other performances? How does this one compare?,This is my first Performance by her but after this series, I will be looking at other stories.,My new mantra is ""don't rely on best seller claims"". I'm 6 chapters in and so far there's been a long winded instruction on gardening and another on how to dress a wound, and not much else. I picked the book based on the summary and claim of reader popularity. I was expecting something clever but instead found a lot (an awful lot) of words that presume to be clever, about a woman whose husband's only interest is sex, and who appears to divide people Iinto 2 categories: overweight or not. I'm at the end of my tether as I obey the Stay-at-home orders and persevere with this book. Or will I? So far I've had about as much enjoyment as I get listening to President Trump drone on about nothing each day in his ""Corona taskforce briefing"". Oh man, I should have taken the blue pill.,Update: I'm on Chapter 13 and FINALLY something appears to have happened. Hurrah!,update again. I'm now on Chapter 15 and can't go on. This book is awful, nonstop drivel. I'd rather visit the dentist. At least I tried.,time travelling mills and boon. yawn. most interesting part, time travel, 90% dialogue and romance..,I started my journey to read the series way back in 2004 and eagerly awaited each new book. I love the books and wanted to give audible a try. I wasn't disappointed my only bug bear is that the narrator, Davina, at times, sounded a little to ""listen with mother"" in the way she spoke. Her Scottish accent was god though.,This series is brilliant if you are in doubt, don't go by the BBC tv series currently out, as usual the transfer from book to tv is poor.,Our Jamie Fraser is a bear of a man, big, strong, with reddish blonde hair and if swooning was still a thing, I'd be doing a lot of it!,Claire is tall and confident and a five years older than him.,Do yourself a favour, either buy the books or download them here. I am using my monthly subscription to buy them all on audio although not sure if I can wait till next month, might have to get two a month. üòé,With ones own imagination coupled with the writers own admirable talent, this is a delight to listen to. The author has told a story that in another less talented scribe would not fill you with all the emotions that Diana has done. A great deal of thought, research and hard work has given us, the reader a journey that I cannot wait to continue in reading the second in the series ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,Absolutely loved this book. I'm a huge fan of The Bronze Horseman series by Paullina Simons, and I've been looking for something as good as. Throughout listening to this book, I drew a lot of parallels out of both books. The characters are well defined and the story is full of detail. The voice actor does a great job and I'm looking forward to listening to the next one.,"
The Movie Book,"Art,History & Criticism",Arts & Entertainment,"great narrator and story line and flow.,I wonder if there is a 3rd book...the end of 2nd half left me hanging.,will need to research if there are more.,A good book to listen to when you're trying to fall asleep...as dull as a Chinese restaurant's take-out plastic spoon.,a great list and brief explanation of various movies around the world and how they are meant to be watched."
Hidden Shadows,Romantic Suspense,Romance,"Was looking for a shorter read (4-5 hrs). This was my first book by Nyssa Kathryn, but I enjoyed it, so I will probably look for more. I enjoyed the narration, too.  Didnt know it was in duet beforehand, but that is always a bonus imo. Both narrators were great. Avery Caris was new to me, but very easy to listen to. Connor Crais was great as usual and had more parts to play.,,This was such a great Christmas story that really can be read all year round. I also love the bodyguard trope. This was a quick listen and Connor Crais did a bloody amazing job as the male narrator!"
12 Rules for Life,"Psychology,Ethics & Morality,Society,Personal Success,Self Development,Self Improvement,Personal Growth",Health & Wellness,"I won't lie an say this was an easy text to listen to. Not even close. Jordan Peterson does not throw his proverbial punches. He says it exactly how he sees it and then elaborates his position at great length with personal anecdotes, scientific research, and professional experience he has had as a psychologist.,If you are willing to do some hard self- and social-analysis, this book may truly change the way you view the world. It may not. I guarantee if you go into it objectively and willing to consider Peterson's extremely well thought-out and carefully worded advice, you will gain something from this book. Even when you disagree, which I certainly did at times, you can gain another clear and honest perspective -- and that is always valuable, in my humble opinion.,It is evident and worth noting that the author has strong political beliefs and values, as well as a Christian background and moral foundation. But he does not harp on any religion being right or wrong-- at all. So be assured that you can find value as a Buddhist, a Muslim, an athiest, or any other spiritual foundation you may have personally.,As for his political stance, as a political 'swinger' myself (as in I vote for the candidate's platform, apparent values and plan, NOT party affiliation), I found Peterson's beliefs to be heavily Right leaning, but don't be fooled by outside accusations of him being anti-liberal, sexist, etc. While he clearly feels strongly against certain political constructs, his views struck me as being more pro-humanity than any other petty label. Again, he backs his points with evidence of many types and explains why he believes as he does. This is how discourse begins, and how blind idealism without logic or critical analysis, ends. Peterson invites a conversation about how people often wear metaphorical blinders and how we might remove them and truly see each other's unique and often valid perspectives. This is how we as a society can grow. That said, sometimes I felt his points were specifically aimed at certain hot-button issues, which valid and valuable, got a tad soapbox-y.,Regardless of how I personally feel about his 12 Rules (which, to be clear, I mostly agreed with, at least in principle, if not always practice), I feel the book is absolutely valuable for EVERYONE to read. I will certainly be re-listening to it.,My biggest beefs with it is:,(a) sometimes the sentences were so dense with meaning I would have preferred to read them, rather than only listen. But that's just how I comprehend complex and often abstract ideas the best. That's just me. But it would be fantastic if the text was available with the audio.,(b) I just have to say -- the focus on women as mother's more than anything else cuts straight to a very personal place for me -- as I am unable to bear children -- so I personally felt a lot more like I was being indirectly told that I had fundamentally failed at something critical for my existence, failed my family, and society after finishing the book -- at least according to Peterson's greatest valuation of the feminine. I am confident that wasn't his intent AT ALL, so I am not offended, just saddened that it was not broached as a side-note as he went into great detail about mothers and women primarily as child-raisers. Biological motherhood is not always a 'choice' we can make, but society as a whole seems to view women primarily (and historically) in terms of their ability to produce offspring. That perspective needs to be reevaluated by everyone, in my humble opinion, including Mr. Peterson. I would like to hear his thoughts on that sensitive, and often devastating, subject. Are childless women still to be held in such high esteem? Or is that our only real value after all? I certainly hope not.,Regardless, I still gained a lot of perspective from this book, a lot to think about, and some of his points really spoke to me in powerful and positive ways, regardless of my gender. So thank you, Jordan Peterson for sharing your opinions, experiences, and values in such an open and deeply considered way.,In this book, I found what I have been lying to myself about. I have been trying to climb my way up the dominance hierarchy by being successful in the world‚Äôs eyes. I‚Äôve been trying to raise my status to make me more attractive to a potential wife. I‚Äôve been doing this by being successful in business, eating healthy, reading books, working out, trying to gain fame, and becoming surface level friends with high status individuals. However, I realized in this book that a lot of it is a farce. I have mainly been doing these things to avoid doing the hard work that terrifies me: deep, meaning relationships. This book isn‚Äôt really about that, but a good part of it is about cleaning out your own closet before you try to save the world. I think anyone can read this book and realize another dragon they have been ignoring. I am going to start it again soon, and I have already made hard moves and had challenging conversations towards cleaning up my personal relationships. Maybe a year from now I will actually be someone that someone great wants to marry instead of just looking like someone who is. Thank you Jordan Peterson.,It's hard to imagine a more impactful work than 12 rules. There were moments, many moments, when I had to stop the book and think and reflect. As other reviewers have mentioned, the author is brought to tears during the reading. This was not some stunt, the topic he was discussing was so biting and deep that it was impossible not to cry.,It's important not to go into this book pre judging Peterson. His or your ideology is not relevant to the importance of this book. He speaks truth, simple and plain. Of course, it is HIS truth and you must understand it as such. It's also not simple. Peterson has this uncanny ability to talk for an hour and have 20 soundbites you want to remember. It's honestly, uncanny.,I can't possibly recommend this book highly enough. It's interesting, it's funny, it's biting, and it's deep. It will change you, but in a good way!,The trouble with Peterson is that he's long winded, but won't stop saying meaningful things, won't stop speaking truth, and won't sugar coat reality to make us feel better, and is therefore impossible to stop listening to. That's good.,It's so disturbing to hear a grown man cry during a reading, because it forces us to encounter vulnerability and strength and breaks apart our denial of reality as a place of suffering. That's good.,Only listen to this book if you want direct blunt reality, wisdom, and odd encouragement. Only listen if you want life to never be the same. This book has helped to initiate me as a man, because, perhaps for the first time, I don't feel ashamed of my masculinity, and so have lost some of the guilt around being a man in western culture.,I think this book will mark a turnaround for men (and perhaps women)  everywhere who feel disillusioned with life, because here, implicitly, he calls out the gold in men by telling them, ""You have something to offer the world."" Now I know there is something worth fighting and suffering for, a better tomorrow for me, and for those around me, because I've realized that because I'm a man, I can make a little more chaos into order.,If you could sum up 12 Rules for Life in three words, what would they be?,Ancient Modern Wisdom,Who was your favorite character and why?,The underdog lobster has to be the best. Some antidepressants and he's right back in the fight.,What about Jordan B. Peterson‚Äôs performance did you like?,I liked his intellectual honesty and also he is a good narrator.,What did you learn from 12 Rules for Life that you would use in your daily life?,If you do not run from your suffering, one day you will overcome it.,Venture into the unknown and slay the dragon of chaos.,Share the treasure.,And become some sort of hero.,How to live a meaningful life, in a practical way.,Any additional comments?,If you like Jordan Peterson, Jocko Willink has similar ideas from a very different perspective, also worth checking out.,I've listened to many of self help crap and even read, The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F#ck. It didn't matter what I read or listened to, I wasn't finding the answere I was looking for, to a question I truly didn't understand. This book along with Peterson's many online lectures put more into perspective for me than anything has in years of searching. I've identified the Dragon growing ever more powerful in my life and come up with a game plan for slaying it!...This book didn't solve my life problems,  it helped open my eyes to the most obvious issues that I'm responsible for correcting....,This is by far the best audiobook I ever bought. Very deep, authentic and healing. I want to give the highest recommendation that I have ever given to any audiobook.,I feel that Jordan Peterson balances perfectly between science and his own life experiences.,It‚Äôs like a good late night talk with a really smart person. The type that when you go to sleep you would like to reevaluate how you are living your life. But you are happy that this talk happened.,,I'm a huge fan of Dr. Peterson, however, as a non-believer, half of this book is painfully tedious. most of the chapters start with scientific facts and anecdotes that are both informative and interesting. Dr. Peterson uses almost there second half of each chapter illustrating his point using the Bible and interpretations of these passages.,I've always been a pessimistic person since I was a young kid (I'm 26 now). Although my family who I rarely speak to anymore is and raised me with religion, I am not religious. I've been depressed since high school and struggled to find a validating meaning to life other than to go with the flow and enjoy the roses.,I got this audio book specifically because I'm beginning to feel as though every time I feel like I'm on the right track with my pursuit of happiness and meaning, I'm always proven otherwise. I picked this up in the hopes of finding an antidote to my chaos.,A lot of the rules in this book were generally things I already knew - however hearing someone else not only say them, but also give much deeper meaning and examples for them helped reinforce them for myself. There are a lot of religious references and examples used but they aren't forceful or anything other than just examples.,After finishing this audio book I do feel more confident about myself and have more of a grip on how to manage the balance of chaos and order in my life and within myself. I'd recommend this to anyone who feels like they need an extra or even the first nudge to get them started on identifying what's wrong in their life before you can begin fixing it.,As a side note, I love when authors read their own audio book. Jordan B. Peterson has a teaching voice (duh), but I couldn't help but smile every once in a while when I would start picturing the words come from the mouth of Kermit the Frog. While comparing the rules to my specific chaotic situation, it was additionally comforting to picture Kermit giving me advice. I mean no offense to the author, and this only made my enjoyment of the book larger."

There's a constant look how evil white people are in the narative of this story. It's not the trolls on the internet that's causing animosity between races in the world. It's the writers for Amazon.,Transgender love, Black women in highest positions of authority, global warming will destroy the world, people who don‚Äôt take the Covid vaccine want to destroy humanity, and a self-professed ‚Äúbleeding heart liberal‚Äù saves the day.¬† The villains, murderers and rapists are mostly straight white males. If that‚Äôs your thing, this production will reinforce your worldview.,Preferred pronouns, top and bottom surgery justifications, pointless story jumping around trying to find a plot, deeply disappointed. No wonder it is free. Only listened to it because Brandon Frazier is in it.,Way too much liberal agenda involved in the story. Very anti God.,The foul language was unnecessary to the story. I really don't read to get involved in more politics and more woke agenda trash. I want to read a story that is just a pure story without all the extraneous garbage inserted.,I really like the concept and so much could have been done with it. Unfortunately, it has more political and social grandstanding than story and the authors opinions detracted from the story.,Listened to hundreds of books.  First written review.  If you like woke narratives about ‚ÄúCovid 50 ‚Äú ,  LGBTQ,  mocking believers in GOD and just unimaginative trash, this book is for you.  Narrators great, storyline predictable, subtle and in my opinion trash.,I needed a quick listen though wanted a apocalyptic scent to the theme and this story wetted my taste. A selling point was the comments calling the story ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù. I found it amusing that treating others as you wish to be treated, and real history upset those reviewers so much.,Only thing I wish it had more of is both the final moments of the last humans left behind. As well as more detail about Home.,Rob Sawyer takes us on an adventure through virtual, physical, and psycho-social space in a story of survival and transformation as five groups of entities five centuries in the future decide their respectively destinies, on Earth, Mars, and the distant stars.,The voice acting is excellent and helps carry the tale effectively. Highly recommended.,Very well produced.,Usually these dramatisations fall into a trap of killing the story with pointless exposition.  This is a well performed and entertaining listen.,Starts out okay; becomes a political piece halfway through. Very strange. If you can overlook the time wasted on that and inconsequential characters, it's an okay story about being brought back to life in the future.,Great listen, I was expecting the usual scifi listen but the book took a surprising turn.,Thoroughly enjoyed this story.,It had a very original storyline & good narration.,Would definitely recommend.,Interesting story with intriguing ideas about cryogenics and their uses. Well rounded characters just wish it was longer.,The constant social commentary (murderers are the type of people who don't get the vaccine) and identity politics is tiresome.,I enjoyed this and will look out for more by this author. I liked that there were several different voices for the characters so it was easy to follow. Excellent freebie.,Unfortunately this book is well and truly on the bandwagon that is putting the demise of earth on humans whether by nuclear means or destruction of the ozone layer. It does so in a manner that makes it even harder to bear as it is very cheesy. How about a different topic audible?,Not the normal type of book I‚Äôd listen to but this was rubbish. Story seemed to jump all over the place and then just ended!  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,Great storytelling the plot was excellent but did not see why it was necessary to include the trans covid and climate issues smacked of virtue  signalling the message in the story was powerful enough without them,Plot is simple dumb fun and the performances are good, But its as if the author has some kind of nerousis and is constantly worming his far left politics constantly in every chance he gets.,You'll very quickly learn which races he likes and which he dislikes, Which views he is completely intolerant of, his sexual fetishes and what fears keep him awake at night.,It almost feels like a parody at times.,My least favourite book on audible.  Found it monotonous .  I do not recommend this one.,This story had so much promise until the woke leftisms took over the story. Why the author felt the need to ruin the story with political nonsense is beyond me. Stopped listening with around an hour to go as I couldn‚Äôt stand it. Reads like something that has gone through the Canadian ministry of truth editor.,The narration was good and the premise was interesting. It was off to a good start but got quickly bogged down in the human element, with frustrating infighting. What killed it for me though was the author injecting his strong views on certain things such as climate change, covid masking and vaccination, left wing politics, woke agendas etc. Then of course there had to be the token trans character, with the only love story being a trans one that made no sense at all. Please just stop. I made it to the end, but the last two thirds were a bit of a preachy gag fest. Shame,,I‚Äôm not usually a fan of dramatisations, however this one was subtly done and very well put together. Brendan Fraser was captivating, and is now my favourite Audible Narrator (sorry RC Bray). I enjoyed the story line and its developments, as well as the manner of story telling. Don‚Äôt let the dramatisation out you off, it‚Äôs a great listen.,Was fine, right up until The injected some woke garbage. Give it a break already. Disney has done enough. Ôøº,Enjoy the narration. Keeps you interested. However, storyline is uninspiring with an attempt to introduce twist and turns which simply provoke a reaction like‚Ä¶. Ok, what next.,Did not finish as narration could keep me interested for so long.,Well acted by a stellar cast and a story that kept me spellbound to the end.,Took a punt on it and was kept engaged - it had a bit of everything - mystery and imagination, sci-fi and adventure - it was fun!  A refreshing change üòäüëçüèª,Short and sweet, I loved the production and the quality work of the various narrators. As far as the story goes, it was thoroughly enjoyable and kept me hooked. Listened to the whole thing in only two sittings and I don't regret a moment of it. If you like speculative Sci Fi and apocalypse stories, you'll like this one. And it's not too heavy on the science either. Cheers"
Attached,"Psychology,Communication & Social Skills,Love, Dating & Attraction,Self Help",Health & Wellness,"There were just too many tests and checklists in this book for it to be a descent audio book.  The information is good, but much better suited to a real book to get the most out of it.,I am of the rare category this book briefly touches on: An individual who simultaneously possesses both an anxious and an avoidant attachment style in relationships.,Between this book and B. van der Kolk‚Äôs, The Body Keeps the Score, I feel almost reborn. To be aware of the issues I have brought into relationships, even if they‚Äôre of a platonic nature, feels incredibly enlightening, powerful, and revealing.,This book in particular felt as though I was being liberated from ‚Äúfate‚Äù, while at the same time, exposing me to the unhelpful thinking patterns that have been accomplice in keeping me from having the type of relationship I truly desire with a partner.,It helped me understand my accountability and the accountability of others in a relationship; it helped me reshape the way I viewed dependency; gave me incredibly relatable scenarios of areas where I know I need to improve (without making me feel awful); and gave me tips on how to spot behaviors that aren‚Äôt going to be helpful in myself, or with a potential/current partner if I want to be the most fulfilled I can be in a relationship.,To say I‚Äôm grateful is an understatement.,If you‚Äôre tired of leaving things to chance and sincerely want to understand the simple things of what you can do to be ready for and aware of the type of relationship you want, this book is the best place to start.,My main complaints about this book are that it's not very inclusive of folks who practice ethical non-monogamy or polyamory. And I disagree with some small parts of what they say. However, the main information in this book is incredibly helpful in all relationships, even if this is focused on romantic and sexual ones. Helped me realize some things about myself, and I will recommend it to others. Essential reading for anyone dating in the modern age.,I have never written a book review before but this was easily one of the most important books I have ever read. Do not hesitate. Highly recommend!!!,This was a great read! Very eye-opening. It however could have been much better.Its faults include: it is very obviously biased towards those with the anxious/preoccupied attachment style; it gives the impression that those with secure attachment style are holly good fellas that just roll through life in a state of perpetual joy and satisfaction;  it does not mention anything about the underlying cause of the attachment styles (which was utterly disappointing); and finally, it gives the impression that the attachment styles are fixed across all relationship types (including non romantic ones) and I dont feel this is true.,Overall the book is average, based on its one sided point of view. Often times the author sided with the Anxious attachment perspective. This view point could leave someone with the thought, no change is necessary on their end. I would reccomend this book to almost anyone, but don't take it for gospel. I believe this book allows you to understand your attachment style and recognize your protest cues, so I'll recommend based on that perspective.,This helped me so much to get over a relationship and recognize what I need in a partner.,The theories presented are undoubtedly helpful in our understanding of relationships and how we ‚Äúattach‚Äù to others. However I found the content slanted in favour of traditional monogamous pair bonds. In no way did it consider or even acknowledge how this information may be applied or interpreted in other viable emergent relationship arrangements.,Basically it says, anxious people need to avoid dating about 90% of the available dating field. Then it gives you red flags to look for in who to avoid.,I always thought it‚Äôs just me (I have both anxious & avoidant behaviours) but after this book I know what my problems are, it‚Äôs good to view my issues in relationships from a third person.,I love how this book put a lot of examples/stories and also tell us how we should do instead. But I wish it could explain more and deeper on how to change the mindset and behaviour.,Recommend to everyone."
Broken Money,"Security & Encryption,Banks & Banking,Economics",Computers & Technology,"I've been listening to Lyn Alden for a couple years on podcasts and YouTube. I subscribed to her free newsletter last year. I follow her on Twitter. I say all of this because sometimes people just consolidate what they say elsewhere, but this book is so much more than her greatest hits. I strongly recommend you follow Lyn wherever she is. She has incredibly useful insights and can word them quite clearly. I've read all the books on finance and the history of money, and this is as god as any of them,,As for Guy Swann, he is a Bitcoin legend and is really great on Audible. He has a vey pleasing voice. He can be listened to very well at 1.5 speed also, if that's your thing.,Lyn does a deep dive on money. Why gold failed, why for the first time a bad money pushed a good money out, etc. very extensive. Guy does a great job with the read.,Loved the book, the performer was good as well. I could have done without the inconsistent accents when reading quotes, but otherwise very solid.,Lyn is one of the great minds of our time and if you care at all about money, freedom, Bitcoin, or even, dare I say it, ‚Äúcrypto(currencies)‚Äù, then this is a must read.,I'm anewbie to most this info and she laid it out beautifully.  some was over my head so will be returning to this book again and I'm guessing again. definitely recommend!!,Lyn's ability to process large amounts of information and boil it down to an understandable and well organized format is impressive.,The first two thirds of the book is a well researched history of money.  Even with extensive study in this area, the book was still able to give a new perspective and understanding of the evolution of currency.,The final third of the book was focued around the Bitcoin ecosystem and its monetary adoption to date.  This section layed out a very wholistic view on the Bitcoin network, pointing out both its potential as well as possible avenues of failure.,Overall I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in monetary history and especially for anyone who is looking for a better understanding of Bitcoin.,The first 2/3rds was great, the last 1/3 was absolutely awful. It was so bad, I‚Äôm left wondering if the author is either not as smart as the first part of the book implies, or is being actively disingenuous in comparing proof of work and proof of stake systems. It‚Äôs ironic that at one point the author mentions the straw man fallacy, and yet proceeds to construct straw man arguments in the proof of work vs proof of stake section. It‚Äôs really, really poorly reasoned, and as such I think this book is a net negative for the crypto movement. A real shame,Well thought out overview of money from first principles. Lyn is so intelligent and able to break the most complex ideas in to simple to understand pieces,The best book I‚Äôve ever read on the past, present, and potential future state of our monetary system.,Best book ever written about money, currency, financial systems and importance of privacy in plain language,First of all Lyn‚Äôs book is great! You won‚Äôt regret getting it and you‚Äôll be a lot more educated and wiser for reading it.,It goes through the history of money, what it is, how it evolved, the problems it sets out to solve and how it‚Äôs been corrupted by banks and governments throughout time. You‚Äôll also learn how to protect yourself against debasement, how to store your wealth and various options you can use, most notably Bitcoin (the best, hardest, most sound money ever discovered).,This book is essential reading and deserves a full 5 stars.,I spent years looking into XRP, ADA, ETH only to come back to BTC. THIS BOOK EXPLAINS WHY.,An excellent read from Lyn Alden, packed with history, insights and clarity. Highly recommend it!"
Elfslayer,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I‚Äôd buy every Felix and gotrek book right now. Hopefully I don‚Äôt have to wait another 6 months for shaman slayer,I think it‚Äôs fair to say that after William King was replaced by Nathan Long, the Felix & Gotrek stories started to feel a bit tired, and I was starting to feel like it was high time Gotrek found his Mighty Doom and the pair of them were gracefully retired. This caper, however, is Long‚Äôs best by far, worthy of William King‚Äôs glory days. It is hugely helped by the return of Greyseer Thanquol, the Skaven Dick Dastardly of Warhammer, as petty and incompetent as ever. The narrator does a sterling job as usual.,The series gets back to it's best with Elf slayer. All the Nostalgia of the older books returns,as expected from this awesome series, the fights, the details, the voice acting. just wonderful!,Jonathan keeble is the definitive voice of gotrek. He makes some interesting choices with the dark elf characters but nevertheless, another instant classic.,Please Please Please release the Ulrika and Brunner series! I‚Äôll buy them like I bought all the Gotrek and Felix books.,Amazing performance  by Jonathan Keeble!  His performance made me love this book series all over again.,Another great Gotrek and Felix story read by the fantastic Mr. Keeble. Just excellent superb even,I absolutely love the gotrek and Felix novels it is by far my favorite Warhammer series and there‚Äôs still more to go. I‚Äôm not quite sure why Audible has the last three before the rest in the series, but it is what it is. I‚Äôm gonna listen to it all over again please give us the last few books. Please,Love the Gotrek & Felix series, really exited for the next one and to start the AoS series afterwards.,really enjoyed the story and the narration. left a smile to move on to the next book.,looking forward to the next one.,This is probably the most grim dark G&F so far, I like now that the novels have possible far reaching consequences and development to the plot without losing the small comedic charm. One of my favourite G&F novels now. Really looking forward to where the next one picks up.,This is as good as the original Felix & Gotrek books, the humour and the characterisation was excellent, and with Mr Keeble narrating it can only be great,Brilliant story and delivery. Enjoyed this one almost as much as Skavenslayer. Please keep them coming üôèüèª,Not quite up to the level of the original William King novels, but a great romp nonetheless!,Rich storyline and more provacitative than the earlier stories. Parts are unpleasant in a way that make you detest the Drucci. So as a big fan of G&F and having heard them all this is my favorite to date.,this is as good as the earlier books. looking forward to the next one cheers,Really enjoyed this, been waiting for it to come out on here, one of the best ones so far,Good story and telling as always. Loved every second. Can‚Äôt wait for the next noe,Alot of the other G&F adventures are often somewhat static, staying and moving between one or two places of the Old World. This one actually takes our heroes on a good old fashioned world trotting quest once again, along with friends and enemies, old and new, from varying factions.,,Jonathan Keeble's performance is once again a great thing to hear for this series, it's sad that we only got a couple more books left to go!,,Nathan long and Jonathan Keeble have done it again.,Awesome story, awesome narration.

And the Primarchs series is also good.,Even if you do not know anything about the board games, video games and warhammer universe, these are great books and fun reads.,This is war. War against aliens, orks, demons and more. There is politics and religion, honor, deception and tragedy in space, but mostly war.,In the far distant future mankind has spread across the universe and many branches of humanity have been lost for 1000's of years.,1. The Emperor of Mankind: A immortal human, given power beyond any being in the universe, by powers beyond space and time, serves as the ruling monarch of the Imperium of Man.,2. The Primarchs, created by the Emperor, were the 20 genetically-engineered trans-human sons of the Emperor of Mankind.

Why?,No because I would rather listen to the next books in the series and there are many of them, although I could certainly enjoy listening to this again and again.,What other book might you compare Horus Rising to and why?,I've read a lot of sci-fi and my favorite genre is what is called ""military science fiction"".  This is by far the best of this genre I have ever read, and it only gets better in books 2 and 3.  Currently I am on book 4.,What about Toby Longworth‚Äôs performance did you like?,Longworth's voice is rich, powerful and dynamic enough to make you believe the different characters.  This is a top-notch reader.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,No because I wanted to relish it and look forward to a chapter or so per day and the chapters are quiet long.  However, if I was on a long drive cross country this book would make an excellent companion.,Any additional comments?,If you love military sci-fi, then this series is a must read.  It's gritty satisfying stuff with great characters and interesting plot twists.  It doesn't matter if you played the Warhammer games or even know anything about it, because you will enjoy these books regardless.  Although I should warn you much of it is very dark and disturbing.  I am currently on book 4 and completely addicted to this series.,It's no exaggeration to say that this is the most entertaining thing I've read in years.  I highly recommend it.,Started slow and was almost going to give it up. Then it gave me reasons to care and continue,I read one of the Horus Heresy books a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. I then read another shortly thereafter and kept waking up to a book in my face.,The different authors aspect is great in theory. Some of the authors tell a fantastic story, whereas others are very long winded and never really bring the story to life. This book is an example of the latter. I was unable to get ‚Äúhooked‚Äù. I found my mind wandering away from the story throughout. I even tried to listen to it a second time to see if maybe I missed something that would bring the story back to my interest, and still couldn‚Äôt pay attention.,The narrator did a fantastic job with the material he had to work with.,I may or may not try another, but certainly not right away. This one left a bad taste in my mouth.,I was really looking forward to this book, and I was not disappointed. Dan Abnett is one of my favorite Warhammer writers and Toby Longworth is without a doubt my favorite narrator for the books. Story itself was epic and grand and a great prelude of things to come. It is also sad in a way knowing the fate that is to befall many of the great heroes in the story. I can‚Äôt wait to listen to the rest. One down, only about 40 more to go. Oh boy.,The story is good, but the audio is so quiet and filled with grumbling voices that it's practically impossible to do anything else while listening.,Descriptions in the story seem to differ from normal Warhammer lore. They paint a much brighter, more beautiful, universe, although one that's still extremely brutal and violent. I found this to be a good place to begin learning Warhammer lore.,So again: good story, but an annoying choir to listen to.,In the future there is only war, and it makes for a great story.  Well written by Abnett, and narrated wonderfully, this is a must for 40k fans and sci fi afficienados.,This book isn‚Äôt so much a narrative plot where you have a conclusive beginning middle and end. It‚Äôs really a impression of the Imperium before the Heresy. To that end, it‚Äôs tinged with sadness as you know the inevitable conclusion. Still, a interesting read and would recommend.,very well performed and cannot aist to hear more. superb job on the reading and voice acting,A great book to a very very long series. Pulls you in and keeps you going till the end.,Horus Rising was spectacular. I have listened to a few Black Libary audio CDs and most have disappointed me. Mainly due to their length, most are only an hour or so long. Horus Rising is over 12 hours long and they are 12 truly amazing hours of splendid back story. This story achieved to paint true depth and colour onto so many key events and characters that I was only basically aware of before. The best scene for me was the diplomatic dialogue that occurred between Horus and his counterpart. So wonderfully well written and the voice acting was splendid in its execution.,Here you are introduced into the world of warhammer 40k at the beginnings of the Horus heresy. It is a great book as a stand-alone piece even if you don‚Äôt like warhammer it is a good sci-if book. The second book in this series builds up momentum very nicely as it thickens the plot,Dan Abnett is possible the best living Sci-Fi author.  Toby Long is one of the best Narrators particularly of Gothic fantasy.  The two of them together are fantastic.,This story makes a great kick off to the Horus Hearsay, but possibly not the best start to Warhammer 40k fiction as a whole.,Dan Abnett is a brilliant writer, but this book was just very dull. I purchased Horus Rising because I so thoroughly enjoyed his Eisenhorn series. Horus Rising seemed to have no real focus, just a lot of random elements and bits of story. It follows one particular soldier, as he hops from planet to planet, killing everything on said planet. This crusade seems to be the only major plot thread in the story, and it's a very dull one. Characters with no previous mention will die, and nobody cares. The prose is fantastic, but the story is just uninteresting.,Toby Longworth is a fantastic narrator, as per usual, it's just a shame the content isn't quite on par.,If you could sum up Horus Rising in three words, what would they be?,Funny, knowing, bloody,What did you like best about this story?,This is the Imperium of Man at it's brightest everything it was meant to be just at the point where it all starts to go wrong,Have you listened to any of Toby Longworth‚Äôs other performances? How does this one compare?,I've listened to a few of Tobys performances this is one of my favourites there's a lt of sly humour in Dan Abnetts writing that Toby gives brings out he also gives a different weight to each characters lines so you wouldn' t mistake the main characters for each other,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,A small joke made by the books protagonist to those among his peers that had previously intimidated him was I thought an excellent way of showing his growing comfort amongst them,Any additional comments?,This is the place to start with Warhammer 40k arguably it's best author takes on the Imperium just as it's golden age is about to end. It's a smart, funny, visceral and violent tale but if you've any interest in the Warhammer universe I'd start here.,Only recently started the black library, this is my second book, and I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far! Toby does a great job with narration!,I thoroughly enjoyed it, casts a completely different side to the warmaster and his legion.,Really good story engaging and made me love the Luna wolves and feel sad at the knowledge of what is to become of their honour and sorry for Logan and Hourus.,Would really recommend very very good did not expect it to be that good. P.,If you were ever intrested in Warhammer 40k at any point of your life, start here and learn about your favourite legion/chapter. I left 40k in the dust as a child but refell in love with it when I started listening to the audio books. Listen for the emperor, brother.,I‚Äôve listened to a number of Audio books now, this one is awesome and such a good start to the epic that is The Horus Heresy.,I cannot understate how amazing this story is. With the knowledge of how it all turns out, there is an air of majesty and sadness that plays out in this Golden Age that Dan Abnett has depicted. With a debate over the ethics of the argument ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right because I say I‚Äôm right‚Äù and a depressing hypocrisy towards those debating it, the foreshadowing of the eventual future we know and love is bittersweet. Abnett has written each of the primary Astarte characters as their own character, rather than simply copy pasting a single idea over multiple.,I‚Äôd highly recommend this to anyone who hasn‚Äôt read it, even if they‚Äôre not into Warhammer 40k.,On a final note:,F**cking Erebus.,5 stars is not enough for this.,fantastic story, looking forward to listening to the rest of the series,I have mixed feelings about this book. In many ways it was quite interesting, with a new slant on space warfare. However, it seemed to glorify war a bit too much. Some quite novel scenarios. However, some of the characters lacked depth and were less than convincing. Worth a listen, but I won't bother with any more in the series.,if you are a warhammer fan you must get this and the rest of them they are incredibly,Im fairly new to 40K and newer still to audiobooks, so to say this was an experience is an understatement. I still think I prefer reading a book, but this is a close second.,,As to Horus rising. What an introduction. The language can be occasionally vague and the dialogue leaves alot to be desired. But it is a fascinating story none the less. I dont know the audible equivalent of page turning, but there are chapters that I could not stop listening, no matter how tired I was.,loved it. the narrator was sublime, the story was detailed and thorough in dialogue and description of characters.,unreal voice acting and tough content üí™. will be picking up more in the series.,Stumbled onto this gem when someone on line recommended me to check it out.,It‚Äôs probably the best fiction I‚Äôve listened to in my pass 12 months of audible sub. The story is gripping, the descriptions of the gritty and full of glory as well as perfectly descriptions on inner doubt and conflicts. Stellar performance from the narrator.,I have gone out to purchase to purchase the next three books already.,Yes. It was that good, for me at least.,I thought the pacing was odd, overall good start to what looks like quite a ride.,,I'm really just not a fan, it was suggested by a friend and I thought I'd give it a shot"
Other Plans,"International Mystery & Crime,Literature & Fiction","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","If you're listening in public be prepared to embarrass yourself by alternating between snorting with laughter and whispering oh no, oh no!,This book is superb. It's hilarious with the usual gang of loveable characters plus some new ones and an ending that leaves you hoping the next book isn't too far away.,Amazing story brilliantly read great book ! Gripping from start to finish and so funny as are the others."
Flat Lake in Winter,"Mystery,Legal","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","This is my forth Joseph T. Klempner book and for now my last one on Audible (I hope there are more). I thoroughly have enjoyed all of his books.,This is a very good book with a very difficult subject to review without giving anything away. Basically there is a very wealthy dysfunctional  family. Dad is uninvolved, mom is closet alcoholic. Now add three beautiful blonde haired, blue eyed children, the youngest showed signs of fetal alcohol effects with intellectual deficits. Include guilt, isolation, incest and a pregnancy and you have one gritty story that kicks off right from chapter one.,The two older children leave home as soon as they are able. There is a suspicious fire and the parents die. Then the grandparents are brutally murdered and the youngest son is arrested. Enter the protagonist Matt Fielder, who is a very nonjudgmental attorney whose ethics ride an internal roller coaster.,This book deals with some uncomfortable topics and unfortunately it has that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" feel to it. Very good book with an ending that is slightly predictable but well worth a listen.,George Newbern does a very good job narrating. I especially liked his interpretation of Matt when he questions his own judgment.,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,If you found this review helpful please indicate so.,Thank You.,This is a terrific book. It's really too bad that so few readers have found it, because it is full of enjoyable characters, a terrific plot, and an ending which will truly shock you. Matt Fielder, the lawyer who represents Jonathan Hamilton, is a fine lawyer who sticks to his beliefs and will not give up for any reason. Jonathan is being charged with the gruesome murders of his grandparents, with whom he lives in an old mansion on Flat Lake, in Ottawa, New York. This is very upstate. Gil Cavanaugh is the DA who is charging Jonathan with first degree murder, with the death penalty as a possible sentence. The case draws a great deal of attention in the small towns in the rural area. Matt is the primary character in the book, and he is very likable. He has taken on a difficult client. Jonathan is quite disabled, perhaps retarded, perhaps autistic, but in any case he is uncommunicative in the extreme. Matt knows virtually no one in the community, and so he has to work very hard to get to know all of the people and the factors involved in defending his client.,The book slows down a bit toward the and, but not all that much. I won't spoil the ending for you, as it is just flat-out fantastic. No one I know could possibly predict it with any confidence, but it is very satisfying. Great endings are very hard to write, and many good books falter at the end. This one does not.,Matt assembles a good team. The DA is a terrific politician, whose re-election depends on the outcome in this case, so he pulls no punches in trying to convict Jonathan. The atmosphere is also terrific: It is winter in northern New York State, and the elements combine to make Matt's job even harder than it otherwise would be. Both the author and the narrator are gifted. The book held my interest very well. There is no trial, which is a good and rare thing in the world of legal thrillers: most books in this arena spend way too much time on the details of a trial, which are actually as boring as they can possibly be. The book focusses on the pre-trial maneuvering, which is quite suspenseful.,I recommend this book very highly. Mr. Klempner deserves a much bigger audience. I hope that more Audible readers find him. You will not be disappointed.,Flat Lake in Winter, first released in 1999, is a murder mystery that contains far too little action and suspense to be classified as a thriller.  But it is an interesting and compelling story of damaged siblings from a horribly dysfunctional family.  I did not enjoy the novel, but it is not intended to be enjoyed.  There is a major plot twist at the end, but that cannot be a major surprise considering the family dynamics.  People who like very dark psychological mysteries are most likely to find this novel to fit their taste. Narration is excellent.,The premise of the book is good but the telling of the story leaves a lot to be desired.,For starters, there are comments made in the beginning of the book about the investigation procedures indicating that this or that would be questioned later....but none of those things ever come up again.,Add in a lazy attorney who simply wants to have sex with every single woman he meets and drops working on his case for days at a time while he's off having a good time and it's a very weak story with some ridiculous story angles and dialogue.,The narrator is the only thing holding this story together. George Newbern is the only thing that kept me in to the finish.,1. Lettuce get this out of the way first: James Klempner is a terrific technician. He's got the chops to wrap a murder story tighter than a DVD.,2. James Klempner fiddles with enigmas. He wraps this tale around a seemingly simple question that has a couple of correct answers: They're both disturbing.,3. In Flat Lake in Winter,  Klempner hauls us along the line between passion and reason.,,He's so authentic that, for a lot of chapters, I really thought this was a true crime story.But the niggling clues dribbled out of hiding to reveal a crafty legal/murder/mental - well - conundrum. Here's a good story, well crafted, with just enough complexity to make me want to unravel it...,,4. Yep, liked this book a lot. And George Newbern's as competent and creative as Klempner. They make this as good as mystery-stuff gets.,,,A good idea gone to waste with a shallow, horny, lazy lawyer. The narrator is not bad, but given the flat writing of Flat Lake, he was out of his depth. It would take an extremely talented narrator to keep the listeners interest in the writers style. There was very little dialogue in what there was, was mostly secondhand. Sentences like ‚Äúshe told him that she would‚Äù would‚Äôve been better phrased with ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù When there is no trace of direct dialogue for pages and pages the narrator was stuck with just reading. And reading. Giving the overall 3 stars was hard, because it mostly deserved 2 stars. But as I said, there was a good premise, and occasional good twists. Characters came in, then droped like flies in the last half of the book. No, they didn‚Äôt die. They were either confined to an occasional phone call, or never mentioned again. One of the best characters, a guide named Bass, is well-developed and very interesting. The problem is that after the first scenes, he‚Äôs not heard from again until the end of the book. The End. Thank goodness.,great narration and an interesting story. warning-  if you listen to this to try to take your mind off the Supreme Court, there is a character with the same last name as our last ""justice""  and described as a friend of the NRA and very conservative . it's a good book, but not the refuge I was hoping for.,I thought it started off a bit like a documentary but slowly the characters came to life.  It's a good story and I enjoyed listening.,I give it a lower score only because it was not my thing. I think the author is very talented and narrator excellent!Too much detail in the first 2/3 that did not interest me. Finally in the last third it became a story and I wanted to know the end.,No real mystery, but an intelligent  written courtroom drama with interesting characters. The reason for my 4 stars and not 5; The incest stuff bothered me. Jennifers ""helping him out"" and initiating the sexual contact . Was this necessary?  I'm not buying that!   The novel is good enough without this part which is the reason for 4 stars.,At first you are overwhelmed by the detail and authentic explanation of concepts in law and the process of taking up a defence position to protect a limited person who cannot defend himself but as the novel progresses it is the humanity of all concerned even the brash prosecutor which becomes the focus of the work and your understanding and appreciation for this work of fiction grows as the writer reveals his prowess. It is a great read and there are more books by this author of equal stature if you have yet to find them. They and this will reward the reader with enjoyment, excitement and insight. What more do you want from a novel beyond this except knowing there are more to come. Read it, you will not regret it, only be sorry you finish it!,Once again , totally absorbed in following the trail he sets through the book.,Highly recommended!"
The Widow's Watcher,"Family Life,Women's Fiction,Suspense",Literature & Fiction,"I literally listened to this story all day. I've been blessed with a few exceptional ""reads"" this year. Psychological thriller, not horror.  Woman loses entire family in plane crash and takes their ashes and intends to die with them. She is saved by an older, grumpy man with a painful mystery in his past; and a cast of characters so real, I forgot they were fiction. The best ""trinket"" is the women (main character) sometimes hears her teenage daughter talking to her;.No paranormal elements. I can't say anything else without giving story elements away. 5/5 stars!,This was my first time listening the one of the authors üìö. I was so pulled to the narrator 's  excellent voice of each person in the book! Between her and this story I fought with myself to stop listening at that time. OMG.. I was drawn so deep into the story!  I was drawn in deeper and deeper as the story unfolded. Not thinking that it would pull me deeper, but it did!!,This book was excellent!,The Author is captivating! Fantastic AUTHOR!!!,I kept waiting for a mystery or something to emerge to make me care about what was going on. It seriously takes until at least Chapter 20 for this book to turn into something even mildly interesting, because until then it's just us (the readers) following around a suicidal and barely communicative Jenna as she grieves for her husband and children. And oh what fun, she's also got a once precocious and now sarcastic teenage daughter scolding her in her head. Add to that the utter joy of Jenna being trapped in a crappy little ""town"" in Minnesota with a 70-something cranky old man who's also dealing with a lot of tragedy and loss. How is this a recipe for success?,,This book has such high ratings, and even after reading through the reviews here in Goodreads, I can't figure out why! I feel like everyone else read a different book than I did, one that was interesting, with great characters, and a rich story. I didn't get any of that out of The Widow's Watcher.,I found this story  painful then healing which I am so grateful for.,It made me face my own sorrow and loss. A fascinating mystery,Taking unsuspecting turns reminding us to appreciate what we have every day and not assume what appears is always what it seems.,It teaches that we are stronger than we know.......have faith.,This book pierced my heart. So beautifully written. Beautifully narrated. I love how the book ended snd how she tied it all together. This is a new favorite of mine.  I love the theme of forgiveness - for others and for ourselves. This book will be listened to, and read, again and again.,This though heartbreaking is such a touching story. If it doesn't pull at your heartstrings, I dare say you don't have a heart at all..,This was my first book by the author and I absolutely loved it. I have listened to many books narrated by Angela Dawe  and I have to say this was her best. The author and narrator complemented each other. I agree with the reviewer before mine that the story kept drawing me deeper and deeper and I could not put it down until the end.,,This is now in my favorite books list. I know I will listen to it again and again.,Every Maxwell novel that I‚Äôve read is a treasure. My mother and I read them at the same time and love discussing the characters  and stories like a mini book club. Great writing!,First listen for this author.  The title was a bit misleading for me and certainly not what I expected.  Spoiler alert:  When it first starts I am thinking this is way too depressing and I wasn't sure I would finish but I kept going and I am very glad I did.  This was a very complex story of immense grief from a young widow who has lost her entire family and a senior curmudgeon who is grieving his lost daughter and son and dealing with a wife who is in a mental care facility.,,There was constant interest from the ways this story took place and the ways they were able to overcome grief that makes one want to give up.,,Give it try and stick it out!,This is the fourth Eliza Maxwell book that I've ""binged listened"" to. She's my new favorite author!! This book was awesome!!,Good but sad story, that twist and turns, narration really good,Would definitely recommend, left me wanting to know more all way through,Got it on audio book, had a few late night's listening to it, was extremely seductive to listen to the more you got into the storyline and  characters."
Brisingr,"Fantasy,Literature & Fiction,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This book is an absolute gem, a must-read for anyone who might enjoy the genre.  It has everything, adventure, magic, romance, humor, suspense, surprise -- all of the elements that make this the kind of story you want to read over and over again.  The narration is very good, except for one vital flaw.  The interpretation of one of the lead characters, Saphira the dragon, is way off base, and it ruins the story.  I thought I'd start this audio book from the end and work my way back since I've read the book many times, and thought this would be another way to enjoy it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Read, read, read the book.,As a fan of the series, I expected a bit more action, a bit more information and not so much detail. This one could definitely be abridged by several hours. I'm about half way through the audiobook, and am having a tough time finding a reason to keep riveted to it.,Robert Heinlein once said that a good writer must be able to tell his/hers story in as few words as possible.  This was once called editing.  If you do not have the ability to delete whole chapters for the benefit of the story you do not have a story to tell.  This book should have been cut by at least 200 pages.  Even Gerard Doyle was sounding tired at the end.  I had great praise for Christopher Paolini after Eldest.  I felt that he had grown as a writer, but his editor is just plain awful.  And after hearing the bubble headed MTV voice of his ""editor"" I can see that Christopher Paolini's only hope for a future is to get a serous editor that has more experience then he has.,,This said I am giving the book 3 stars because it is not a terrible read (listen).  Mr. Paolini has brought us a good book, I am just sorry to see such talent being manipulated for the publishers good.,,My favorite character in this book has to be the dragon, Saphira.  She is portrayed as so caring for Eragon.  The bond is immeasurable.  I have enjoyed following the two of them through all of their adventures. I look forward to the next book series to see what happens.,Great detail, great story lines.  Can't wait for the next part.  Plus I love Gerard Doyle's animation of the characters.  His voice is the best ever!,I loved the first two books and eagerly awaited this, the third and final installment of the famous Eragon trilogy.  Unfortunately this is not the end.  Evidently there will be another book.  This book covers no ground.  Most of it is mindless rambling or filling just to stretch out the adventure for another book. If Paolini is a great writer, he will write other great books with different characters, why does he see fit to drag Eragon out until he pulls the character down from one of present day literary greatness to a mediocre after thought.  Greed is the only answer I can think of.  It is such a let down and such a shame I spent 2 credits on a book I could skip completely with the exception of maybe three sentences and pick right back up with the next.,I enjoyed the first book, tolerated Eldest, and hate this one. The things that annoyed me in the first book just keep getting worse.  Paolini strips the magic out of magic and the mysterious romance out of adventure.  He insists on explaining and analyzing everything endlessly.  He is unceasingly introspective, and lacks the moral authority to kill his enemies without suffering sleepless nights of recrimination.  What a whimp.  I seem to be identifying the author with the main character, but I have little doubt that he does himself.  The dialog in this book drones on endlessly, interspersed with pointless exposition on minutia that I suppose was intended to add color, but succeeds only in adding bulk.  It will leave you praying for some action.  Paolini needs to get himself a cheeseburger with everything on it, a girlfriend, and a job digging ditches so he can learn what life is like in the real world.  Then he will be able to put some color into his writing.,Emotionally flat, with the occasional anthill or small valley, this book leaves you with nothing.  Unable to capitalize on his earlier success and grow, this installment by the author lacks the depth and range that make a good premise into a great novel.,,Instead it is a tiresome plodding series of events that do not flow, and characters whose motivations lack the ring of authenticity. His world has elements that are interesting in and of themselves.  It is a place of magic, and mystical creatures, love, war and strife, things that almost always make for a good escape.,,That is why it got three stars.,,That he took those elements and made a hash of it is disappointing to say the least.  If you are interested in those sorts of worlds, Goodkind, R. Jordan (RIP), and George R.R. Martin are genuine masters, even if they have the occasional flaw.,,If you read the first two novels of this series, you could take this one or leave it without gaining or missing out.,Now this is a book that is just being drawn out WAY too long if you ask me. This particular title in the book I found almost irrelevant and listening to the final one in the series before writing this review basically confirms to me that the author was simply bidding for time or had no idea how to continue with the book. I truly think that this book in particular was the author's desire to either stall for time to think of what else to do with the book or simply milk it for all it's worth. My take on it.... It was a combination of both and this was absolutely positively no worth it....,The narration in this book which normally for me is pretty good but seeing that the story for me was just a whole bunch of useless fodder got downright annoying to me after a while. He did the best he could do considering of course, but irrespective of his wonderful inflections and great tone if the story itself is annoying you chances are some of that will seep over to the narration.,As for the story itself, normally I would say that this book sets up well for the final book in the series however there wasn't much added to this book for me to say ""Yes! This was completely and utterly necessary"", instead I kept hoping they would get on with the story. Yes there were some interesting battles and whatnot but hardly impressive or noteworthy enough in the grand scheme of things to think that it required a book for itself. I found myself, at the end of the book, feeling unfulfilled.,I am still trying to figure out how or why this book was as long as it was and (in my mind) so irrelevant. I can hardly remember most of the happenings in this book and were you to ask me to give you a play by play of this particular book I couldn't (which is just plain sad if you ask anyone who knows me).,Ok, so I'm actually really impressed with with the author. Sure it's obviously that he borrowed a little too much from LOTR and Star Wars but I can forgive that for a good story, which it is.,,That being said. The major problem with this series is that instead of going into detail about the things that are very important to the story, the author seems to talk about everything forever just to prove that he can make this place real for you.,,The major events of the book are great but they are interrupted by very long, seemingly unimportant plot lines that make the story drag on. In this book's case, it was forced into two books when it clearly should have been one. This is the first book I would ever say that I think I would have enjoyed an abridged version more. However, it is worth the read if you can take it.,I read the first two books of the series 6 years ago and liked them, but since the series was not complete then and I don't like reading a volume every 2-3 years, when I no longer remember the details, I waited for the last two to be out and then started again with the first volume. I'm just about to finish the last one and... no matter how it will end, I already know I love this series and I will read it again several times in years to come.,I love the way the dragons are portrayed, I love the world the author created, I wish I could visit and meet all the characters... Someone mentioned their child loved it. Well... I'm 35 and I loved it :) I would venture to say they are not for children, though. Teens, yes, but they are scenes of cruelty and torture and... that's not for children.,These are serious books, very well written. Wisely written, I would say, since they really contain lots of wisdom, in nuggets and... spread throughout. Buy and enjoy, they are well worth your credits!,Brilliant set of books, I loved every minute of them. G√©rard Doyle is so emotive and engaging. I don't think I'll ever tire of listening to him read.,The story grips you and the promise of adventure keeps you hooked. I can't recommend this series strongly enough.,This series had so far been fantastic! I never got around to finishing it when I read them the first time, so I can't wait to start the next book. Apart from the raspy voice of Saphira, Gerard Doyle does a fantastic job narrating. My best bits: Eragon's new sword, the final battle chapter and Orik's speech to the dwarves in Tronjheim.,This book and the whole series narrated by Gerrard Doyle is beautifully written and narrated.  These books are rich with detail and twisting turning plot.  I almost didn‚Äôt read them because of people commenting about the annoying dragons voices, I found them appropriate myself.  Definitely the sort of books that I will love to read again to absorb more and more detail.  Superb work thank you!! What great value for money too!,Another brilliant sequel. I've read all the books and the different voices of the characters brings it to life!,Would you listen to Brisingr again? Why?,This is the second time I have listened to the series, it is very well read so I find I a joy to listen to it while out and about. As the story unfolds before you, you feel like you are along side the characters in the plights as you are transported in to their world by Christopher Paolini's words,My favourite book in the inheritance cycle. It is just as good as I remember. I well worth listen.,You should listen to it at a faster speed than is set, Paolini writes a lot, some of which is a passing pleasure, and Doyle reads at a very slow pace, so you will get very bored very quickly.,its the best story every I want they to hurry up and make the films,Where does Brisingr rank among all the audiobooks you‚Äôve listened to so far?,Very high! I found the story to be so captivating!,Who was your favorite character and why?,Safera. Easily! You can't beat a dragon.,Have you listened to any of Gerard Doyle‚Äôs other performances? How does this one compare?,He is a very good narrator. Would recommend him.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,If I would have yes, but it's obviously very long!,The narrator was OK but the actual story was great definitely recommend this book and the whole series.,The story was too long, I think a lot of it was pointless, could have combined with other books. There were some good parts, and some important events, but I was glad to get to the end of it!,great story but why dose saphira sounds like master Yoda and Gollum combined why ????,These books were my whole childhood and when I got audible one of my first purchases, I have to admit at first listen Doyle's Sapphira voice grated me deeply and i struggled listening but finished them all. after a year of other titles with some brilliant ( Stephen Fry and Kobna Holden-smith)  but mostly average narrators(could be my choice in books some being lesser known) I came back and listened to Gerard Doyle's narration of these amazing books and I was blown away with his consistency and skill, his ability bro replicate so many voices so fluently is astounding. 10/10,Simply sensational range of character voices, sounds and emotions. Doyle heightens the humanity (elfinity, dragoninity...) of the protagonists of Paolini's epic.,The story is so well written and Gerrad Doyle performs it so well, The character's voices are so realistic.,-NYXandtheArts,,This book is so descriptive and hooking I‚Äôm hooked like a fish man I‚Äôm hooked like a FISH I love this BOOK!!,,C'est un tr√®s bon travail de narration mis √† part le timbre de voix des dragons."
A Court of Silver Flames,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure",Romance,"I have been waiting for this book for months now. I was so excited to hear another story from a beloved series. Until the narrator ruined. It was over exaggerated to a embarrassing degree and especially during the intimate scenes it was absolutely laughable. Amazing book, but I would recommend recording it with one of the previous narrators if you want it to be successful. This one can‚Äôt even compare to the last 4 books as far as narration.,I know how many Sarah J Maas Fans have been anxiously waiting for this book with high anticipation and hopeful expectations...I am one of them!! *sigh*,My review is not for the book itself, as I haven‚Äôt gotten very far into the story. My very sad and disappointed review is for the Audio version.,I don‚Äôt mean to diss or be unfair to Stina Nielsen, I have listened to her narrate prior books that I enjoyed. I‚Äôm just not sure what happened here with the Major Overacting. It‚Äôs almost like listening to something being narrated for very young children.,So yeah, it‚Äôs been very distracting to the story, which is SO unfortunate! It sucks when a beloved series changes narrators that may not know, or get the feel of the characters, or how the story has been told in the prior books.,I really don‚Äôt like being negative or critical about an artists‚Äô work... I‚Äôm sure Ms Nielsen is very talented and well regarded in her field. Sometimes things just don‚Äôt vibe right.,I would just recommend listening to the sample before purchasing the audio version.,Posted by: ShaunaSmiles üòä üéßüìö,I've been waiting over a year for this book! I pre ordered the audiobook and woke up today excited like Christmas morning. However, after suffering through 4 hours of the narration- I had to give up. I am loving the story so far despite the rough narration (which is a testament to Maas and her amazing series) but I feel like I have to continue reading on my own so I can pay more attention to the plot line and less cringing at the narrator. Everything is so overacted, voices all sound the same (especially the women) and I find my mind constantly wandering and missing the narrators of the last 4 books. If you are able to read the actual book, I recommend saving your audible credit, buying a copy and bringing the characters to life the way they deserve.,Nesta, Feyre, Mor, and Amren all sound the same. I had a hard time knowing who was talking. There is no cunning to Amren's voice, no light to Mor's, no sharpness to Nesta, and no hopefulness in Feyre's. They all sound tired, bored, and ""sultry."",I should have purchased the hard copy instead.,Love the story; HATE the narrator. Everything is over done, the accents are terrible, character voices are all the same. Do yourself a favor and read the print version.,I feel badly being this critical of someone‚Äôs work, but it seems like the narrator was purposefully trying to sabotage the book.,This is a long novel and many readers waited months for its release, so it is unfortunate that the audiobook was so disappointing.  The author and this narrator appear to have worked together before, but the narrator sounds seriously impaired on this project.   I‚Äôm not sure what happened, we all have off days.  My advice, if you are a Mass fan, is to buy the hard copy and save your eardrums.  It was that bad. It didn‚Äôt matter if you increased or slowed the playback speed.  It was like a train wreck at times, you just couldn‚Äôt believe how bad it was.  I don‚Äôt even remember most of  the story because you can‚Äôt get past the overly dramatic ‚Äòacting‚Äô.   There will be a lot of refund requests on this.   Sorry, I know this is harsh, and the author likely had no control over the final copy, but hoping it prevents someone else from enduring countless hours of torture.,TERRIBLE narration and a rip off  storyline of the first 3 books that goes nowhere.  I wanted this book to work but oof, very little happens in this plot except Nesta has lots of sex, trains, and deals with her insecurities,  This book doesn't move the ""A Court of Thorns and Roses series"" forward at all, and felt like an excuse to write raunchy sex scenes for the devoted reader for a quick buck but none of the magic of the 1st 3 books.  I forced myself to finish it but would die of deep shame and mortification before ever recommending it to a friend.  Guilty pleasures are great but this book was a pale, empty experience.  The author did a disservice to her fans.,I‚Äôm counting down the minutes until I return this for a refund because of the melodramatic and silly  narrator. At this point, I‚Äôm like, one more minute, one more minute. Also, when did this series turn into the Black Dagger Brotherhood? Same-same! The author dialed it in, so I guess none of it matters.,This review is going to be short. I'm going to have to buy the book and just read it. This performer did not listen to the other books to properly research her roles and it shows - big time. The voices she gives everyone are so incredibly off, it's jarring and frankly disappointing. I was so looking forward to this latest installment to the series. This performer missed the mark by a lot.,Still in the beginning, but holy mother of God, are these characters insufferable. The only good character is Nesta. She had literally several story options and we choose the route of making her a prisoner because they don't like her lifestyle. Forced relinquishing of freedom never sits right with me and I would love a story where Nesta deals with trauma her own way discovering something on her own while battling back the Night Court and her sisters. Maybe Nesta could learn more about herself by being the independent woman she is and that she need helps. But I know where this story is heading and it's going down the road the other books went down. Feyre and Rhys are ones who call the shots completely. I get it, they rule the joint, but still. I just want someone who knock them down a peg. Please!!!,Another thing, she doesn't have to fall in love. seriously, she seems like the person to not fw with this characters to begin with so this forced relationship that is already building with Cassian is not doing for me. Nesta is literally the only character with actual character.,I just want someone to punch Rhys in the mouth. Just one time please.,Really disappointed with the narration of this book after waiting so long for its release,This book was ruined by excessive graphic porn scenes!  Why oh why did SJM have to ruin a perfectly good series with trash!!  The story is good enough without descriptions of what was dribbling down her leg!  The graphic porn scenes added NOTHING to the storyline, and why the heck so many, I got fed up in the end.   On this premise I'll return the book, and hope SJM goes back to good quality story telling.  If I wanted 50 shades of... or Jackie Collins I would have bought that.,,Did SJM really need to sink to this depth to sell books?  Surely not...,,I loved the series up to this point.,Very disappointed with the narration, I've had to buy the book to read instead as the characters aren't at all in keeping with the narration for the previous books in the series. Gutted.,Stina Nielson is a great narrator but not a great choice for the characters in this book, didn't reflect the steeliness of Nesta.,Bit disappointed with the ending, I wanted the drama between the characters after being faced with the challenges, but instead got about 30 mins of round up that was flowery and didn't match up to the intensity of what they had been through.,Also a bit disappointed that Nestas triumph got completely ingnored by her family for the sake of making it about Feyre (the stuff with Feyre could have just happened a week later).,,,Firstly, I went in thinking that it's hard enough writing a sequel for a great book, but this author has pressure with a capital P after the whole ACOTAR series because each book was phenomenal. So where would this land in the scheme of things?,,'ùë∞ ùíâùíÇùíóùíÜ ùíèùíê ùíìùíÜùíàùíìùíÜùíïùíî ùíäùíè ùíéùíö ùíçùíäùíáùíÜ, ùíÉùíñùíï ùíïùíâùíäùíî. ùëªùíâùíÇùíï ùíòùíÜ ùíÖùíäùíÖ ùíèùíêùíï ùíâùíÇùíóùíÜ ùíïùíäùíéùíÜ. ùëªùíâùíÇùíï ùë∞ ùíÖùíäùíÖ ùíèùíêùíï ùíâùíÇùíóùíÜ ùíïùíäùíéùíÜ ùíòùíäùíïùíâ ùíöùíêùíñ, ùëµùíÜùíîùíïùíÇ. ùë∞ ùíòùíäùíçùíç ùíáùíäùíèùíÖ ùíöùíêùíñ ùíÇùíàùíÇùíäùíè ùíäùíè ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíèùíÜùíôùíï ùíòùíêùíìùíçùíÖ‚ÄîùíïùíâùíÜ ùíèùíÜùíôùíï ùíçùíäùíáùíÜ. ùë®ùíèùíÖ ùíòùíÜ ùíòùíäùíçùíç ùíâùíÇùíóùíÜ ùíïùíâùíÇùíï ùíïùíäùíéùíÜ. ùë∞ ùíëùíìùíêùíéùíäùíîùíÜ.‚Äù,Remember that?

So much more.,Before we get into it, let me just say that this is 100% defo not a YA read‚Ä¶ like, at all‚Ä¶.,,This is where A Court of Silver Flames comes in and completely upturns my emotions. If you were contemplating whether to buy the book, let me tell you right now that you should. And if that still doesn't convince you, maybe the fact that I finished the entire book in just over 24hrs will. You heard it right, I read all 750 pages in under 2 days because I just couldn't bring myself to stop.,,There has been so much hate for Nesta that many people seemed not to want to read her story. For me, she was awful to her family, but I knew that awful came from somewhere profound.,‚ÄúùíÄùíêùíñ ùíïùíòùíê ùíèùíÜùíÜùíÖ ùíÇ ùíÑùíâùíÇùíëùíÜùíìùíêùíèùíÜ ùíñùíë ùíâùíÜùíìùíÜ?‚Äù ùíÄùíÜùíî. ùëµùíê. ùíÄùíÜùíî. ‚Äúùë∞ ùíïùíâùíêùíñùíàùíâùíï ùíöùíêùíñ ùíòùíÜùíìùíÜ ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíÑùíâùíÇùíëùíÜùíìùíêùíèùíÜ.‚Äù ùë®ùíõ ùíïùíâùíìùíÜùíò ùíâùíäùíé ùíÇ ùíòùíäùíÑùíåùíÜùíÖ ùíîùíéùíäùíçùíÜ. ‚Äúùë∞‚Äôùíé ùíèùíêùíï ùíÜùíèùíïùíäùíìùíÜùíçùíö ùíîùíñùíìùíÜ ùë∞‚Äôùíé ùíÜùíèùíêùíñùíàùíâ.‚Äù,This book has kept me up through the nights, learning Nesta's past, long before Fayre went into the woods and killed the wolf. Her sullenness eventually turns. With her entire family around her, she realises that she can't talk to anyone, to explain why she is the way she is. Nesta needs to forge her own bonds, forged in blood and silver flame, she finds her family, and herself.,,Sarah told us that this book was going to be about healing and self-discovery, and that's exactly what it did. We saw a different side to both Nesta and Cassian, a side that was never completely visible from Feyre's first person perspective.,,""ùë¨ùíóùíÜùíìùíöùíêùíèùíÜ ùíÖùíÜùíîùíÜùíìùíóùíÜùíî ùíâùíÇùíëùíëùíäùíèùíÜùíîùíî. ùëªùíâùíÜ ùíìùíêùíÇùíÖ ùíïùíâùíÜùíìùíÜ ùíäùíîùíè'ùíï ùíÜùíÇùíîùíö. ùë∞ùíï ùíäùíî ùíçùíêùíèùíà, ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíâùíÇùíìùíÖ, ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíêùíáùíïùíÜùíè ùíïùíìùíÇùíóùíÜùíçùíçùíÜùíÖ ùíñùíïùíïùíÜùíìùíçùíö ùíÉùíçùíäùíèùíÖ. ùë©ùíñùíï ùíöùíêùíñ ùíåùíÜùíÜùíë ùíàùíêùíäùíèùíà.  ùë©ùíÜùíÑùíÇùíñùíîùíÜ ùíöùíêùíñ ùíåùíèùíêùíò ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíÖùíÜùíîùíïùíäùíèùíÇùíïùíäùíêùíè ùíòùíäùíçùíç ùíÉùíÜ ùíòùíêùíìùíïùíâùíòùíâùíäùíçùíÜ."",I loved the character development and the whole process of Nesta's recovery (as much as one can recover from trauma/ptsd), as well as the relationship‚Äôs that we saw between Nesta and the other women who had been through terrible things. I think that this book was important and had to be written very carefully and with a lot of consideration. And I truly believe that Sarah delivered that.,I found the book to be highly amusing, often humorous, with the perfect mix of angst, anger, love, and consideration. Nothing really seems to be rushed, but it was amazing to see into both Nesta and Cassian‚Äôs minds and perspectives. It really gave a massive insight into those characters, their story, and their past. I loved the new characters that were introduced.,,I just want to end my review with this final note: whilst this story is being sold as the love story of Cassian and Nesta, it's so much more than that. It's about the importance of friendship, family and ultimately, loving and forgiving yourself.,All in all, it was a fantastic book that I would definitely recommend (maybe not to younger viewers though due to some of the more explicit scenes).,,If you want to offend your ears by all means waste a credit, but the narration of this is shockingly bad. A weird breathy, unlevelled, overacted performance. I found myself getting so frustrated at the bizarre narration that I couldn't finish it. I may purchase the book at a later date, but after 10 hours of listening hardly anything happened, it was just repetitive.,,I don't mine a sex scene, but these were not steamy they were just crude. Considering this started in the young adult genre, its a bit excessive. Paired with the narration, I just felt uncomfortable. down right awful.,,Its worth noting I read the original books, so I'm not being bias in favor of the previous narrator.,this did not need to be this long. I think the valkyrie storyline was well done and sweet. But holy moly all the sex scenes where so looooong and happen very often.,It was sad not to follow feyra anything at all in this book, or elaine for that matter. And mor was nowhere to be found?!,overall it had potential, but it fell kinda flat.,So much snarling, growling toxic behaviour it was really a struggle to get through and I kept having to stop the book from pure cringe. I gave an extra star for the blood rite. That part was good.,Let me preface, I am a true fan. But this just wasn't it.,,I'll try not to spoiler but just beware.,,I loved the idea of what she was trying to do, and she did justice to the two main characters, their development and what she was trying to achieve with it, though you know its coming from the start,,HOWEVER,,Most of the plot around that main storyline was completely pointless? There was too much training and stacking bookshelves to the point it was repetitive and boring. There wasn't enough true threat from the villain for the ending to mean anything substantial. Feyre and Rhys. Well, also not enough substance really so rendered their little bits rushed and unfulfilling. That should have been told from their point of view in a different book maybe.,,The narrator was an absolute 'mare. Too husky and weird, especially for Mor and Azriel when the old narrator did so well at giving their characters life and personality. And there were some moments I had to pause and recompose myself from cringing. I don't know how the technicians that recorded her reading the sex scenes and got through it without laughing and dying internally.,,And as for those sex scenes - yeah cool we all love a bit of sexy time but it was a bit OTT after a while. There were 3 or 4 words that I heard way too many times to be necessary and despite one particular word not being as 'omg' in the UK as it is in America, I actually gasped in horror lmao. It was all too try hard to live up to this 'big sex scenes reputation'. And I really pity the young girls listening that will be filled with highly, highly unrealistic expectations of their adult lives to come.,,Really disappointed to be honest. Waited so long for not actually much substance.,I really tried to keep going with this book, i went back to it multiple times but i just couldn't do it  - didn't get past chapter 5 anytime i tried again. The stupid voices the narrator put on seemed like they screeched through my air pods.,,I'm hoping that Sarah J mass goes back to her previous narrator - makes no sense to switch narrators throughout a series of books anyway, We get used to the voices of the characters and suddenly it changes and not always in a good way.,,Why on earth did they changes narrator anyway?!,,I loved this series of books and fell in love with the characters but i'm returning this book and giving up on this book series for now.,,,,,Absolutely love this book. Sarah j Maas has done it again. However the I really struggled to listen to the narration.,Entertaining story but the narration could have been a lot better. Still worth listening to.,I loved the story, but the narrators voice was so irritating, especially compared to the other narrators in this series.,Sarah J Maas, as usual, has written an incredible book and I absolutely loved it! I cannot wait to see who's story is next and devour that also!,,Original narrator preferred. Once invested in a series, it is really jarring to change the voice that has become familiar. The characters are no longer the same.,I loved the rest of the series, but this narrator made it impossible for me to get through this book, so I will have to read it instead of listen to it.,Struggled to listen to this book because of the narration. All characters sounded bad, especially Cass.,Scorching hot! It was a roller coaster ride with Nesta and Cassian. I am very impressed with the character development for both of them and how my hate for Nesta turned into admiration for a woman who learned from her mistakes and fought so hard to accept herself and her choices. And, cauldron blessed! The sexual tension and smut scenes are mind-wrecking! I will personally not recommend this for very young readers as it was pretty wild and rough from that perspective. Once again, the world building is just astounding as how it was in the first books. The battle scenes are action-packed and screaming feistiness both from the main characters. I enjoyed the fact that the author made Feyre and Rhysand step back to remain as secondary characters as per the synopsis and flow of the story. This is epic and definitely worth the wait. I loved each and every part of this book: the good, the bad, and even the smutty scenes. Damn! SJM‚Äôs writing style has always been incomparable. *standing ovation*,Liked:,Character Building,World Building,Solidarity of the crew,Disliked:,Book Cover,Too smutty,Not for young readers,Setting: 5‚≠êÔ∏è,Character Building: 5‚≠êÔ∏è,Writing Style: 5‚≠êÔ∏è,Message: 4‚≠êÔ∏è,Overall: 5‚≠êÔ∏è,Overall, SJM gave us another powerful character and plot. I would like to read more on Elain, Azriel, Mor, and Lucien. I really do hope that the next books will talk about these characters in a detailed manner so we can get to know them deeper. I will also be expecting a more conservative approach although I‚Äôm not really complaining but it was so hard to listen to the audiobook with all the sexy scenes. I highly recommend this if you want to know more about our night court crew and how things fell into place.,Five monstrous stars! Definitely worth it!,~JaNnA~,I enjoyed this 5th installation of the series. Seeing Nesta's point of view as she grew out of severe depression was inspiring.,I just had an issue with the change of Narrator. The first 2 books were perfectly narrated. The change of narrator in book 3 was jarring for the first chapter, but she copied the voices for each character so perfectly that I barely noticed. But this one... Just not good. Her voices for other characters changed consistently, and we're so jarringly different from previous voices that the change was a bit much. Her 'sultry' voice was very distracting and her breathy voice for Feyre and basically every character except Nesta and Cassian was extremely off-putting.,But the story was good, and I enjoyed their love story, even if the sex was very intense haha,I would have liked to have seen more bonding between Nesta and her new friends. Nesta's character development was good, but the predictably raunchy sex scenes were mind-numbing - less truly is more, and some things can be left to the imagination of the reader. The narration was too soft for my liking. I was disappointed that Nesta lost so much of her bite at the end, only to become a 'blushing, complient bride. Also, where is the diversity in the range of characters? As far as I can tell, almost everyone is white, stunningly beautiful, and mostly heterosexual. This is echoed in the Throne of Glass series, where the fae males all sound like they eat anabolic steroids for breakfast and grunt, growl and snarl their way through the books. Tedious and shallow, but less so than the other ACOTAR books. And please - stop with the smirks and excessive eye-rolling!"
At the End of It All,"Coming of Age,African American,Sports",Literature & Fiction,"I'm in love with Rae Lyse! Her writing style reminds me Love Belvin. She is on my favorites list along with CCJ,Love,and Alexandria. Ason and Phat remind me of Tori and Ashton IYKYK. It was good to see cameos from Dom and Claudette. Can't wait for her next drop!,I enjoyed this novel so much. The story line kept me glued to my phone, The love story of Ace and Phat was an emotional rollercoaster, but it made for a great story. Also, I‚Äôm a HUGE Jakobi and Wesleigh fan! My only con, if you can even call it that was Gus‚Äô accent. I could have done without it.,Rae Lyse knows how to tell a story. She captures your attention from the first page, and takes you on a journey. While love is the foundation of the story, it is intertwined with flaws, weakness, life lessons, strength and endurance.  Ace‚Äôs struggles, growth and redemption are documented in his relationships and love of basketball. His story is gritty, complex, and controversial, and I loved EVERY minute.  I also enjoyed the baby‚Äôs growth to a ‚Äúlittle lady‚Äôs‚Äù.  Narration is on point.

Ace and the way he was a child of  privilege and super talented but was just so humble and giving. Phat the young inexperienced slightly immature girl that dedicated herself to taking care of her Mom was heartwarming. Wesleigh and Jakobi‚Äôs voices are THEE BEST. They could narrate an old yellow pages and I‚Äôd be hooked,I‚Äôve listened to nothing less than a 100 romance books on here, but this book is extremely childish and unrelatable for me, so many details were unnecessary, I listened to the end tho but rolled my eyes literally half the time,,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. it was real and relatable. I like it wasn't all unicorns and rainbows. The addressed real life issues. The story was beautifully written and the narration was perfect.,Love and Basketball never fails. I love a good long story that can keep my interest from the beginning all the way through. I didn‚Äôt want it to end. Perfect narration to top it off. Definitely worth my credit.,I love it I like how u get in to the character story love you style .. a must read for the rae lyse fans.. can't wait to see what's next.."

Iron Flame,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I loved this story‚Ä¶. The narrator made me want to pull my hair our. She made Vi sound like a guy and her voices were horrible. Probably one of the worse audiobooks I‚Äôve  listened too. Teddy Hamilton once again was great but Rebecca Soler wasn‚Äôt.,I really wanted to like this. But it felt like 70% of the book consisted of the main characters whining about trust and honesty and how they love each other but they can‚Äôt BE in love because they can‚Äôt communicate. The world building doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense and some of the writing feels out of place. While the first book felt like a cheesy combination of Divergent, Hunger Games, and every other super popular YA novel involving young people starting/fighting in a war/rebellion, it was still interesting enough to get through. The characters felt much more solid in the first one. But everything fell apart in this one and the ending just made me want to buy the physical book just so I could throw it off a cliff. If you were on the fence for the first book, you probably won‚Äôt enjoy the 2nd.,Not sure what is so bad about the narrator. I like her style. She does a nice job acting as well. I like that she adds in little details like yawns, laughed, huffs, etc to draw the characterization beyond just the words of the author.,This story really had me hooked. The ending has me locked in for book 3. I can‚Äôt wait. Keep these coming. The story and characters are so good.,It has the same problem that grossed me out the fourth wing did i can consistently hear this lady breathing heavily swallowing and sniffling she sounds sick it‚Äôs gross sorry. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE STORY THOUGH.,Rebecca Soler breathes into the mic, swallows, sniffs, she can't keep a steady pace, or volume. I enjoy her narration other than I genuinely had to slow down and speed up in the story so much that I had to be more active than if I had just picked up the book. This is incredibly inconvenient for those who are visually impaired and switching these would be more of a nuisance. I restarted chapters over and over trying to figure out what happened. My normal speed is 2x-2.5x, however, I had it down to 1.15x and that was too fast. Then she would slow down again and 2x then felt slow.,,I can't even guarantee this is a good audio for a reread because of her bad narration. The audio for Fourth Wing had to be redone because Rebecca was sniffing up snot for 11 chapters. You can still tell she was sick, but this is telling about the quality we're expecting from her now.,Great book, but this narrator is just not good. Teddy Hamilton is fantastic as always, but Rebecca Soler is just not right for audio. I listened to the last book, and thought she was just sick, but no it‚Äôs just her voice. The swallowing and breathing are just so off-putting, it‚Äôs kind of gross to listen to, even at 1.5x speed. She also starts to do voices for different characters, but they all tend to blend into one voice and it‚Äôs hard to tell who is who. I liked this story more than the first one though. It felt more complete and the amount of depth in the story was great.,‚Ä¶.. I am unwell. I loved the first book fourth wing and was hoping this one would be equally as good and I am not disappointed. Story is amazing! Sobbed multiple times. 10/10. Rebecca Soler does a fantastic job portraying the characters and their emotions. Guess I‚Äôll have to listen to this on repeat until the next book comes out.,I enjoyed the first book but this one just wasn‚Äôt it for me, it‚Äôs overly long and contrived and loses most of the entertainment factor of the first sadly.,This is very likely my favorite book of all time but the spots where the narrator is reading spoken character lines using the wrong character voices she‚Äôs established things start getting lost. It‚Äôs way better than the problems in Fourth Wing‚Äôs audio but had I not been reading along I would‚Äôve been kinda lost. Def worth it but still kinda wish they did more edits,Soler uses different voices for each character but then fades them all into the same. Violet also is made to sound like a whispering male at parts that are not only distracting but off putting to point of clearing the app. Why Rhiannon (a poc) was ever given a cali-valley accent is beyond me. Soler‚Äôs choice to raspy breathe and audibly gasp was a detriment to the storytelling too but not nearly as gross as her hard swallowing at pointed intervals (many of which are NOT indicated in the book- yes, I checked prior to writing this review). Hamilton was great as always and professional. Half of me wanted more Xaden POVs just so Hamilton could take over for longer in the storytelling role.,See, I really loved the first book. The meat of this story was lacking. The female narrator put me off especially during action scenes. It made it unbearable‚Ä¶ maybe I need to buy the book and read‚Ä¶ I might feel differently. As of now, I actually couldn‚Äôt wait to finish the book (out of boredom).,Unlike this first book, I just couldn‚Äôt get into this book. I‚Äôll give it another go later on,Fourth Wing gripped me, Iron Flame was a struggle.,The majority of the book was a couple arguing repetitively with very little time spent on character development and world building. There's no subtlety in Yarros' writing to help you build up to pivotal/emotional moments. It was a struggle.,I liked the narration. She tended to speed up during battle scenes which helped set the frantic, desperate ambience.,The narrator is nasal, bad at making different voices (makes it hard to differentiate the characters) and tend to sound aggressive even when the character isn't supposed to be.,Narration aside: (might contain spoilers),I did enjoy the story, but I feel like there are quite a few plot holes. Violet is supposed to have the mind of a Scribe and be very intelligent - I would then assume she's curious, questioning everything, and highly observant, with the ability to add up everything the observes. However, she seems to be the opposite. It is a bit annoying, as a reader (listener, lol), to understand multiple things loooong before the main character does. So I did feel like it was quite predictable at times. I did not, however, see the plot twist at the end, and I'm excited to see where she takes the story next.,I would give the story 3,5, but I rounded up so people will want to check it out for themselves.,All in all I did enjoy myself, but it is a bit lacking.,I honestly wanted this series to be brilliant BUT Jesus. listening to the two title characters go back and forth arguing for 70% of the book. it's like EastEnders with dragons. can I have my money back please.,This book is like getting punched in the head and stomach continuously for 28 hours. 10/10 would recommend.,The character building, twists and turns in the plot that I didn‚Äôt see coming. The performance by Rebecca is incredible, I cannot recommend this enough,Completely gripped from start to finish of this long book, new and original story. Fantastic,I love this series so far. really enjoyed it. I hate that I have to wait for the next one. Recommend to anyone,I have missed being this captivated by a book. can't wait for the next one.,There were some parts where the writing was a bit cringe. The ending made me roll my eyes.,One of the most disappointing tales I have heard in a long while. Written in the first person it maybe should have been retitled as I. Narration was terrible, screechy and childish tones. Please think twice before purchase.,Honestly, the narrator is awful. Not a fan of the constant shouting in many scenes.,The plot is okay but the romance is so cliche and just stupid. I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at how ridiculous it is. Didn't particularly enjoy the writing style either.,Probably won't read the next one.,Please replace him. it does not suit the character at all.,Well done to Violet' voice actor, though.,Another great book from Rebecca Yarros.,,violet is so irritating in this one. the events were hugely predictable and repetitive,the loves scenes and the main characters emoting over one another is nothing short of tedious,loved it!!,i went and got the physical books to reread!! do it! fantasy isnt my usual genre but OMG.im hooked,Twists and turns and villians abound.,Thoroughly enjoyed the stories of the Dragons, their riders and the strength of characters.,Enjoy how no one is safe how for the thrill of battles characters are changed.,Story line is fantastic so many twists and turns. The narrative style could be improved,I really do enjoy these books. The narration is excellent too. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book."

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,"Personal Success,Self Help,Self Development,Self Improvement,Personal Growth","Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","I think The Subtle Art... might have had more impact upon me if I was 20-something instead of 59-years-old. The language isn't really an issue (it just becomes another word that doesn't even seem to have much meaning); it's more that Manson is repetitive and doesn't offer anything original that most people haven't learned for themselves in a few decades of experience. For me, the same ideas are expressed much more elegantly, cogently, and thoroughly in The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking by Oliver Burkeman.,Part of me bought this book because I thought it was funny and quirky, part of me bought it because I was sick of giving a f*^k about so many little things  that ate up my day, I didn't have any energy for the things that really mattered.,This book isn't about throwing everything to the wind and turning in to a useless blob. It's about giving f^*ks where f^*ks deserve to be given, placing your f^*ks where they're going to do you good instead of drag you down. I highly recommend it, but if you pass on it, I really don't give a f^*k.,I think their is some merit to the ideas of Mark Manson, but they do not give enough content for a whole book, which was rather a waste of time. The first parts of the book were interesting, but later on it was just dragging on and on with no real content. Most of the writing is &quot; I think&quot; rather than &quot;I know&quot; - there are rarely examples or evidence. It's like a living-room chat with a friend.,You could probably sum this book up in a 20 min TED talk without losing anything that matters...,This must be a book for the intellectually challenged. He takes the Buddhist concept of suffering being the central element of life and the acceptance of this in the 21st century then hits you on the head with it for many hours. This epiphany comes after many  years apparently getting it wrong and now at the sage age of 30 he rediscovers it like an undergrad sophomore and should perhaps reread his book again. Anyone who purports to get it, doesn't get it.,Is there anything you would change about this book?,No,Would you recommend The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck to your friends? Why or why not?,Not really, most are smarter than that,What aspect of Roger Wayne‚Äôs performance would you have changed?,He was the best part about the book,Did The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck inspire you to do anything?,It inspired me to disconnect from my Social Media,Any additional comments?,This is really basic, simple shit. I can imagine if you have no familiarity with the basic principles of Buddhism and Taoism, you might dig this. Its basic philosophy rephrased with significantly more uses of the word Fuck.,This book has a funny and intriguing title.  And Audible‚Äôs editors declared it the best self development title of 2016. So, I bought it.,The book sets out a more or less complete philosophy of life.  Given this, I assumed the author had lived a long life, learned and relearned profound lessons, and was at a point where he could distill which lessons were truly the most valuable.,The book starts off strong with some interesting ideas.  But its assertions seem to get weaker and more debatable as the book progresses.   By the end, it felt to me as if the book had lost its way.,About halfway through I found myself wondering whether my assumptions about the author were correct.  I checked.  Nope.  He‚Äôs just a smidgen over 30.,What leads a person just out of his 20s to decide he‚Äôs qualified to instruct everyone else how they should best live their lives, I don‚Äôt know.  I finally lost all faith in the author when he quoted Timothy Ferriss.,Would you recommend this book to a friend? Why or why not?,Probably not.  It has an interesting premise, and a lot of the points the author makes are useful and logical, but as a 34-year-old woman, I found it hard to relate to a lot of what the author said.  It seems he's garnered most of his wisdom from years of partying and traveling.  Both of those are things I haven't done extensively and don't really do now.  The principles still hold true, but I probably didn't need a whole book to learn them.  I think a simple blog post would do.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Roger Wayne ‚Äì was your favorite?,I really liked the narrator.  Even when the book became repetitive, I was able to pay attention to him, which is saying something for me.,Take an intro to philosophy class instead...read Plato...something with depth. This book is watered down bs...not worth the time or money.,If you prefer your self improvement advice packaged in vulgarity and frivolous stories of the author's sexual prowess, then this book is for you.,This was written well‚Äîthough sometimes I found the anecdotal descriptions a little tedious or obvious.,The book is funny, direct, and for the most part, I agree with a lot of Mark Manson's ideas.,However, after listening to the book once, it seemed like his point was: ""Your problems aren't that bad; don't be narcissistic; get over it."" But there are some issues that are much more complicated than that‚Äîand the cause and/or result of all problems can't just be roped into selfishness, narcissism, and immaturity. Granted, these can be causes/results of behavior, but the view is limited.,In my opinion, this book is helpful for getting through the day to day minutiae and trivial problems we have in relationships and business, and perhaps not in-depth enough for those with more deep-seated issues or trauma.,All in all, this book is worth a read, if not for the entertainment value alone, but also for a crash course in how to not be a big baby about things that don't really matter in the long run. It's a good introduction into some older philosophical and religious concepts as well.,Initially I thought this book was superb. An interesting take on analysing oneself, sharp humour, a breath of fresh air.,But then about 20% of the way into this it is abundantly clear there is no substance. As soon as the humour thins out and the author starts going into lecture mode he‚Äôs out of his depth. Very simple anecdotes that have been heard in various guises many times over. Then it seems to turn into a platform solely for the author to constantly tell us how many sexual conquests he has supposedly had. Most people know the psychology behind that.,It took so much effort to try and get through this increasingly mundane and narcissistic book but I finally gave up when the author made himself out to be some sort of holier-than-thou deity because... he‚Äôs so honest. So honest that he doesn't refrain from telling his wife if she doesn't look good before nights out, resulting in her storming off in obscenity laden huffs. What amazingly profound, deep and admirable people. But most of all...honest.,I was thinking about stating what a rip off this book is, then it dawned on me - I bought a book that clearly states on its cover, in no uncertain terms, that you shouldn‚Äôt care about anything. What a mug I am! This guy is really funny.,The first part of the book, with its slight over use of vulgar language, gives a different perspective on how to approach life. I liked the description of where best to place your ""f**ks to give"".,Unfortunately the second half of the book descends into waffle about the authors life experiences, which are not particularly interesting.,This audiobook would‚Äôve been alright if the word fuck wasn‚Äôt repeated literally 5 times in every sentence. I consider myself a pretty liberal person, and maybe it was just the annoying American accent, but it feels like using fuck constantly was just a way to make up the word count. This audiobook has no substance, the narrator is annoying, and the author comes across like a massive knob pretending to be down to earth. It‚Äôs not funny or enlightening - don‚Äôt download.,The book contains many self praising statements and anecdotes where the author glorifies himself to sometimes cringeworthy levels, but the message is agreeable. The book could have the same effect as a 20 page essay, most of it seems to be filler and personal anecdotes.,What absolutely ruins the experience is the narrator. With the most condescending voice, he emphasises curse words like an edgy teen like the rest of a sebt and mimics the voices of women in falsetto,lots of swearing and immaturity initially followed by patronising generalisations. profanity masquerading as wisdom. disappointing but good in small parts. sorry for non use of capitals. I'm being lazy and don't give a f#ck,There are a couple of good points in this book and it is funny sometimes,  but there is nothing new and I got bored by the end.,Another shallow self help help book. Nothing special on this one. Its actually quite the opposite.,This book is dreadful. It has no soul. Just a load of nonsense sewn together with even more swearwords. Boring and uninspiring- a waste of a credit.,its not for everyone, dont know if its right for me, but it made me hopefull, and thats somerhing I havent fellt in a long time,After scintillating start, I found it developed into a collection of uncorrelated ramblings . I hoped for instruction and less observation. Maybe I'm missing the point.,This starts out really punchy, with great humour. But it soon descends into cookie-cutter self help preaching. Ironic that it points out the problems with exceptionalism early on, then goes on to base lessons around the stories of exceptional people. The book may offer some perspective for younger adults, but if you're pushing middle age you've already learned what's worth giving a f*ck about.,Just another self-help book that has you nodding in places but leaves you empty. The fuck word is completely unnecessary but obviously used to boost sales. In a nutshell you're going to die, so make sure you care about the important things in life.,Would you say that listening to this book was time well-spent? Why or why not?,Yes, it's a good, simple book for those who've never undergone any cognitive behavioural therapy.,What was the most interesting aspect of this story? The least interesting?,It's a simple overview of self-help tactics that appear in more technical/academic books.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Roger Wayne ‚Äì was your favourite?,Same character the whole time. At times he came across as a little obnoxious, but that was a true performance of the material within the book.,Was The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck worth the listening time?,Yes, it's shorter than other books that cover similar points - I listened to the whole thing on a six-hour drive.,Any additional comments?,If you liked this, I recommend The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris.,Couldn‚Äôt listen to anymore of this beyond an hour ... he‚Äôs just too much a condescending smartass ... listen to the 5 second rule ... it‚Äôs incredible and the writer actually sounds like she‚Äôs cares.,I'm sorry, but it's true, Mark has absolutely no clue how to write. I got this audiobook after reading excerpts from his website, expecting this to be of the same quality. Now, I'm almost certain that the ""excerpts from the book"" were ghost written, because the rest of this sad excuse at an anti-self-help book are condescending rants that somehow have absolutely nothing of value to say. I'll give the narrator credit though, he has an engaging voice and does the best with the material that he can, but unfortunately that's still not good enough,Prior to reading this book I had herd conflicting reviews. I personally found this book to be quite refreshing and thought provoking. Whilst this book is by no means a silver bullet I feel it's a fantastic piece of the puzzle. I think this is perhaps a book that gets mixed reviews depending on where in life that particular person may be. If all aspects don't particularly appeal to you at this stage, reread it in the future when your circumstances or mindset starts to change.,The book is not a shallow as the title may suggest, I have definitely recommend it to my friends and family.,Baby boomer idealogy spouted like it's sage wisdom. If you're a sane adult, this book doesn't add anything more than you already know. The performer also uses this weirdly sexist tone when he's reading out a female voice or thought. Pure cringe,well worth listening to. Nothing mind blowing which was a refreshing change. Bit overuse of f@ck...we got it!,Not even interesting in any way. It‚Äôs just the random ravings of an attention seeker. Saying nothing new at all.,There was a lot of philosophy from many different religions. However everything come down to just one very simple thing. Grow up and accept your responsibility and don't muddle in non important affairs."
Drudge Match,"Cyberpunk,Dystopian",Science Fiction & Fantasy,The story telling is so good that I can see everything in my head as the story is told. I grew to love the characters and the world the author built. I can tell he poured his heart and soul into this book and this saga. The narrator is amazing at expressing the story and breathing life into the characters. this series will always hold a place in my heart. The writing is artistic and beautiful. A must read. It makes me sad it's over but it was perfect. I'm excited for his new series! Congratulations on such an outstanding saga.
The Plight Before Christmas,"Holidays,Romantic Comedy",Literature & Fiction,"I liked the dude until we got into the backstory. Nothing but a gaslighter and it turns her on. Barf.,Not your average Rom-Com.  This book has it all - Humor, Emotion & SPICE!! Joe Arden & Maxine Mitchell did a fantastic job narrating this story. I could go on, but I don't want to give any spoilers away. I'm SO glad I bought this book because it is SO WORTH it!!,In some ways this feels more like a family dramedy, like the movie Parenthood, with bits of comedy among family drama with generations of couples and kids. Frankly, the family part worked better for me than the romance. Whether Elvis loving dad or Santa hating Payton, the camaraderie and good natured ribbing gave good holidays feels.,,On the other hand, the second chance romance was a long slog told through clunky flashbacks and unnecessary F bombs. It‚Äôs 1.5 hours just for him to appear. It‚Äôs six days in book time, and another 8.5 hours in listening time before the reveal about why they split 17 years earlier. During all that time, Whitney‚Äôs stubborn refusal to give him a chance made her very unappealing.  I sort of forgave his initial reason for not explaining anything, but come on! It‚Äôs senseless to stay apart 17 years and just insane to hang out with her whole family for a week and still refuse to talk. Does it make for a dramatic ‚Äúyou had me at hello‚Äù moment? I suppose I may have choked up a bit. But the set up didn‚Äôt have to take so long, nor did the backstories need to be thicker than a country song. It made the ratio or humor to angst too skewed toward angst for a Xmas romance.,Narration was cringy (especially Payton), storyline was drawn out and boring, and the sex scenes were a little too TMI for a Christmas story.   I can‚Äôt believe I actually finished it.  Maybe I was optimistically hoping it would get better.  Spoiler alert, it didn‚Äôt.,Exceptional book that made me laugh and cry happy tears. Not only is Kate Stewart an amazing author but the narrators were phenomenal. This is one I could listen to over and over. Chapter 25 made me scream in excitement and get all the feels. Wonderful audiobook!,Author did a great job of building this story and family. The family as a unit was hilarious. I laughed out loud multiple times and there were also a few tears shed.  There were some times when I felt it kind of dragged a little but stick with the story. It‚Äôs worth your time and credit.,Kate! You always rock my socks with all your books and as usual Joe and Maxine are fantastic narrators.,A wonderful, lusty, romantic, family centered heartwarming and at moments laugh out loud funny! Highly recommend!,This is a definitely 5 star. I was honestly expecting a nice sweet holiday story and got an amazing great holiday story The performance of Joe and Maxine were spot on!! Maxine there are no words to say on the performance you did because it was so good, the way you were able to change voice for each character honestly *hats off* to you because you are very talented. This audio had me on an emotional rollercoaster ride, that scene where Eli decide to tell Whitney what happened to him, was just so good. The emotions in this audio made me cry. Joe that scene was just incredible, I felt all the pain in which the character was going through. And that cameo, it was nice to hear him again (IYKYK).,I treat myself to one special audio book each season and this year it was a waste of time and money,  I am a liberal person but this book was so crass and vulgar and it had little if anything to do with Christmas.  Save you money for something more in tune with the magic of the season.  Sad.,Characters are kind of flat and not all that likable. I might have been able to finish it if that were the only disappointment, but I didn't realize there would be so many detailed sex scenes, which is really not what I'm looking for in a novel.,Loved this. Funny, emotional, heartbreaking. Had me laughing out loud, crying, all the feels. Joe Arden and Maxine Mitchell once again did an amazing jobs bringing  these characters to life.,Absolutely perfect story don‚Äôt forget your tissues and a glass your favourite drink ü•§ you will need them. Narration is fabulous as always,The best feel good spicy Christmas love story. You will fall in love with these characters, heightened only by Joe and Maxine‚Äôs incredible narration üíñ,Outstanding performances by Joe and Maxine really brought this story to life.,A more realistic depiction of family dynamics at Christmas with a good mix of humour, angst and tragedy.,Highly recommend this audio book.,loves these two narrators together! They definitely make the story. it‚Äôs was such a good read. if you‚Äôve read the raven hood series all i‚Äôll say is cheaper 26! you need this,I loved this story!!,It made me laugh, cry and then laugh again.,My fave book of 2022.,You won't be disappointed,Anything from Kate Stewart is just a rollercoaster of emotions and I love every second.  Wonderful love stories with lots of laughter and tears my collection of her books is rapidly growing.   I can‚Äôt get through them quick enough to then listen and re read them over again. Chefs kisses all round,Enjoyed the story and the atmosphere created at the family home. Found some of the dialogue a little cringe, especially from Eli who was a combination of Christian Grey and Batman.,After devouring Kate Stewart's The Ravenhood trilogy in a matter of days I decided to go for another one of her books. This author is fast becoming my favourite! She has a way with words that makes me feel emotions other books don't. Full of laughter, love, heartache and healing it was just what I needed after the devastation she caused me during The Ravenhood trilogy. I loved the links to RH with an appearance from a certain someone, a nod to a boutique and even the weed selling deli guy!,I'm betting this will be revisited year after year around the Christmas holidays. Brilliant narration again from Joe Arden and Maxine Mitchell that tops it all off *Chefs kiss*,,I absolutely loved this book the narration was fantastic I felt all the emotion from Joe and maxine couldn't have picked anyone better to do it 5 star book and 5 star narration hope they gonna do reverse by kate as well,I absolutely loved this book I was stunned when Sean made a little cameo appearance! Absolutely loved that a little cross over being set in Triple Falls. Loved Eli & Whitney! Kate Stewart is such an amazing author her characters feel so real they stay with with you long after.,As usual big fan of Kate‚Äôs work,I was expecting a little more humour, I wouldn‚Äôt actually say this is that funny but still a great story and I LOVED the Sean Cameo I love Sean.,4 star listen,Narration was fabulous,Done in duet narration really really well. Great listen just before Xmas.,Great work Kate,This book is so wholesome, thought provoking and heartfelt. The narrators were the perfect choice and I loved that it was a duet.,The feels are real with this one folks. Kate Stewart is the puppet master when it comes to tugging your heart strings. It's funny, beautiful, heartbreaking, and a love story that will forever be engraved into my heart. This will be a new Christmas tradition, reading this book.,both audio presenters are my favourite of all time , I love their work together and love how they do the dual POV with each speaking their own role throughout the book. The happy feels are forever"
Rich Dad Poor Dad,"Personal Finance,Self Development,Investing For Teens,Middle Class",Money & Finance,"The book itself is worth the buy and then some, the only reason I found it hard to finish was one thing that the narrator did. Constantly having to hear him have to ""wet his lips"" is irritating to the listener, especially when using headphones while listening. It's not normally a big deal unless it's something you have to hear every other sentence.,I had read the paper version of this book in 2011 while attending grad school. Having little to no financial literacy at the time, the concepts were foreign but digestible. I would like to think that I took away some of the author‚Äôs broad themes after I completed the book.,Desiring an easy ‚Äòfiller‚Äô book between two others, I recently returned to the audiobook version for a catch-up. One of the first things I noticed these six years later was that several of the anecdotes were outdated or misleading. Specifically, the continued referral to Donald Trump‚Äôs financial abilities. Now I‚Äôm not pretending to know everything there is to know about Trump‚Äôs financial status, but I thought he bankrupted his companies?,Which brings me to my last thought of irony. After finishing the audiobook this time around, I read a few articles online informing me that Kiyosaki (his company) has recently declared bankruptcy as well. Additionally, several countries have him and his business under intense scrutiny for fraud and scams. Again, I don‚Äôt know all the facts (and you should do your own research to build your own case) but I do find it somewhat worrisome that an author who‚Äôs trying to aid in financial intelligence and give us tools to increase our cash flow is himself in hot water financially and morally.,At the end of the day, it‚Äôs your time and money; do what you want with them. For me, I won‚Äôt be recommending this book again. I believe Kiyosaki‚Äôs time has past.,Would you try another book from Robert T. Kiyosaki and/or Tim Wheeler?,Robert - Yes,Tim - No,How could the performance have been better?,The narrator was constantly swallowing and making disgusting noises when he wasn't talking.  The noises are loud and extremely unpleasant, especially when listening on earphones.,You didn‚Äôt love this book...  but did it have any redeeming qualities?,The content was good.,Would you listen to Rich Dad Poor Dad again? Why?,The book is very good!.  The reader, Tim Wheeler, has not received proper breathing instruction to narrate a book.  Some people don't breath while they speak.  This is not a healthy habit.  It is distracting to listen to a book where the reader holds his  breath and gasps between pauses.  It actully interrupts my breathing while listening to him.!!!,,This book will reshape how you think about money. It will truly show you what you have been doing wrong since you were a kid, what you were not taught and should have been taught when you were growing up. I wish I had some of the advice this book offers a few years back when I was younger it would have made a world of difference by now. It's never too late to learn though. Read this and act. Don't let the common emotions of the (chicken litttles) in this world steer you away from becoming a business owner or an investor. It's your freedom on the line and no one else's.,Thank you Robert God bless,What would have made Rich Dad Poor Dad better?,more research and less boasting; more solid information not just anecdotes,Has Rich Dad Poor Dad turned you off from other books in this genre?,this author,You didn‚Äôt love this book...  but did it have any redeeming qualities?,basic points are good but never elaborated upon,The only good advice here is that you should work on your financial education. Which is common sense,The author does a great job of writing without actually saying anything. The book is full of anecdotes and intangibles. There isn't much in this book you can actually put into practice. He also advocates for doing some illegal things to get out of paying taxes. Much of the book is supposedly the advice he got at the age of nine. No nine year old would have acted the way he did or have asked the questions he claims to have asked. Seems to me he wrote this book just as a way to make money without giving any real advice. Very disappointed.,This book wasn‚Äôt for you, but who do you think might enjoy it more?,Anti-intellectuals.  Tea Party supporters. Anyone who hates government employees. High school drop-outs who hope to exceed the lifestyle of their (former) childhood friends who pursued college degrees.,,What do you think your next listen will be?,Something intelligent.,Who would you have cast as narrator instead of Tim Wheeler?,It is unfortunate that Tim Wheeler is associated with this inane book.,What character would you cut from Rich Dad Poor Dad?,The author Robert Kiyosaki.,,Any additional comments?,Wow! It is so hard to write a review for a book this bad.  Anti-intellectual, joke, pretentious, self-absorbed, farce,  ... what else is there to say?  If you are a Tea Party lover who lives in a trailer park; this is your book.  If you have high school degree, you will recognize this piece of trash for the lame manifesto that it is.,Here is the essence of the book: ""Real Estate rental income = good.... Taxes = bad.  Public employees = very bad.  Anyone who earns a salary and has a benefit package is a socialist (i.e. police department, fire department, public school and college teachers) are the bane of all good hearted capitalists.,I don't normally write reviews.  I don't have the time.  I read books, listen to lectures, absorb ideas and move on.  But this idiot makes Sarah Palin look like an intellectual.  How many times can you repeat the same drivel about the middle class ""not knowing the difference between an asset and a liability""?  There are at least 50 pages of the same repetitive message.,,I have met a ton of self-made millionaires, and very few of them have the pompous and ridiculous attitude that this moron does.  The moral of the story is: ""The good man/woman avoids taxes and shelters (hides) his/her income at all costs.  Anyone who works for the government is the root of all evil.  Free the capitalists let them loose and they will heal the world. Amen!"",,Would you consider the audio edition of Rich Dad Poor Dad to be better than the print version?,I've not read the print edition.,What other book might you compare Rich Dad Poor Dad to and why?,Other investing/business type books, nothing specifically as it has it's own twist on things.,Who would you have cast as narrator instead of Tim Wheeler?,Anybody else.,What did you learn from Rich Dad Poor Dad that you would use in your daily life?,Focus on my balance sheet and less on my income statement.,Any additional comments?,This book can be summed up by saying, focus on your balance sheet and overcome obstacles when they're presented.,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?,This book seems to mostly be a hatched job of socialism parading as a fair and balanced viewpoint. The author seems sincere in his belief that a socialist philosophy is just an economic stupidity, and then goes on to extol the apparently endless virtues of what is, at heart, some fairly straightforward capitalist dogma.,While from an individual's point of view, the advice given seems likely to achieve the end goal of making the individual using it richer - at least a little - there seem to be quite a few pretty critical issues entirely overlooked.,The first is ethics. This question isn't even passed over lightly, it's completely absent from the book. The author wants you to think about how to get rich - full stop. He clearly feels enough guilt over his strategies to offer the platitude that poor people are really responsible for their own problems, and if only they'd change how they think about the world, they too could be rich. In so doing, he lays the challenges and problems of the poor and middle classes at their own feet. He explains, at some length, that taxation is bad and implies that people who pay taxes are stupid, and helpfully elucidates that America and the UK were both countries that had no taxes at one point, but fails to mention that the effect of tax was, in part, to make the countries the global powers that they became by allowing them to invest in projects that no individual could manage alone. Not that tax is bad, though, we're assured - just that smart people don't pay it.,Yes, fine. It's possible to evade taxes - rich people do it all the time. That doesn't make it an ethical thing to do - just a selfish and short-sighted one. Even the rich enjoy having public services such as a police force, army and roads. Boasting about not contributing to things we literally all need seems to be the exact thing the author subtly calls the rest of us who do - terminally short sighted and stupid.,Moving on. The second major problem is that the strategies presented would literally fail if more than a tiny minority of people adopted them. In a world full exlusively of investors, ironically no one makes and bread. The behaviours suggested in this book are fundamentally parasitic in nature - you leverage other people's hard work to make yourself rich at their expense. Smart, but very destructive to society as a whole. Still, the book will absolutely help you get rich enough to stop caring if the whole system crumbles.,Third, this is a book of it's time, and will age less and less favourably as time goes on. With radical changes coming more and more rapidly, the approach advocated by this book is going to become less and less relevant. Hard times ahead - except for the people who already have pretty much everything. If that's you, congrats. If not - you're screwed in the long run, even if you take all the advice in the book.,I'm sure the author would tell me that I'm my own worst enemy, though, because in spite of his efforts to be 'neutral' and 'balanced' in how he presents things, his own viewpoint is fundamentally that of a pretty greedy man of slightly better than mediocre intelligence.,This book encapsulates capitalism and for the most part whatever your philosophy, the advice is sound...at least from a 'Western' stance. Kiyosaki is clearly very passionate about the subject matter which adds an air of confidence and authority to his book. Some have criticised that the whole,'rich dad' thing is a fabrication...I would suggest that this is an irrelevance. Any successful entrepreneur will tell you that acting 'as if' is often a given. Kiyosaki can get carried away at times and make what I would say are ridiculous suggestions such as education being for mere fools......and this lets an otherwise excellent book down. At times, Kiyosaki apologises for being unfair...and then continues to be just that and there can be a two-faced element to his arguments as a consequence. Narration is always important with audiobooks and Wheeler's approach is impeccable. I'd encourage Kiyosaki to take some time out to embrace some more Eastern practices as money alone whilst important is ultimately a mere fabrication of mankind. Nevertheless a very enjoyable listen...if at times a tad trite.,This is a bit of a mix, really, and there are some issues.,It seems America-centric. A lot of the advice offered is not directly relevant to other countries because the laws are different. For example, in the UK it is not necessary to set up a corporation to claim business expenses offset against tax; you can instead set up as a sole trader or partnership.,It also does seem that Kiyosaki is cherry-picking when it comes to anecdotes offered. This may or may not be the case, but it is the feeling I get. He seems to go off on a rant when talking about an investment that increases in value by 16% year-on-year because he's been told by other people that the investment is ""far too risky,"" but he does not explain the investment.,Nevertheless, some of the advice I do feel is sound. To own businesses (rather than taking time to run them yourself) and to learn to make good investment decisions and make them both seem good ideas from the point of view of the end goal of generating money without working for money. That's obviously the ticket to financial security which is what the book is really about. If you have a regular income and you don't have to ""work"" 40 hours a week to get it, that's the goal.,The problem for me with this book and many similar books is that it describes what has worked for Kiyosaki. Kiyosaki has a unique set of skills as has every other person. In his case it led to riches; in other people's cases that may not really apply.,,I haven't finished listening to this book yet and one of the reasons it's taking me a long time to get through is that it's read in a very monotonous tone, which makes the material feel more boring than it needs to.,But I also have problems with the content of the book, since the author spends so much time telling us to accumulate assets instead of liabilities, but doesn't really get down to the nuts and bolts of how to do that, which is frustrating.,too many vagueries and not enough specific plans of action. Whilst the principles are somewhat useful, these are meaningless without specific details on how to execute.,,So I finally caved and got this book... somewhat useful for motivational purposes I suppose, though don‚Äôt expect any revelations.. I agree with some points and disagree with others. If you truly have no concept of personal cash flow then it‚Äôs a good place to start!,I really enjoyed this book. It  teaches you the mentality that drives wealthy people and the core principles that made them rich. I am putting these principles into action.,Would you listen to Rich Dad Poor Dad again? Why?,I will 110% be listening to this audio book again as I feel that there was too much valuable information to take in all at once, next time I will be taking notes and using them to begin educating my own children. I listened to the whole book within 24hrs as I just wanted to know more and since finishing the book I have bought 3 more of Rich Dads audio books.,,What does Tim Wheeler bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you had only read the book?,Tim Wheeler was a great candidate for Rich Dads audio books as he made the listening experience more pleasurable with his tone of voice and delivery of speech. He also has the ability to make you feel as though he is actually sitting beside you and talking to you personally.,Did you have an emotional reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?,It made me feel a little bit angry at times as I felt like the working class are actually kept in the dark about a lot of the topics spoke about in this audio book. It also aggravated me to think that my children are now also being ""Trained"" at school to become only suitable for employment. I have since been proactive about changing my children's course of education and also about they're financial way of thinking. A definite must have for any loving, caring parent.,Any additional comments?,For any one serious about opening there mind and changing the way they see things I would highly recommend. A small price to pay for potentially life changing information!!,This book surprised me on how well it went through the mechanics of what makes someone rich vs someone who is wealthy.,I am from the convential educational system,  and over the last 15 years or so I have experienced exactly the symptoms of the new wealthy middle class as depicted in this book - study damn hard,  work extra hard and you will succeed.  30 years later only find the mill needs more energy and I am shutting down,  very little to show for it,  lots of hours spent but 60% of my wealth in others pockets!,This is a must read for all,  especially parents in the west.,From an Economics Major,  Accountant,An inspirational book. Recommend this book highly if you want to learn how to take control of your finances and make money work for you!!!,Half common sense and half irrelevant to Aussies.,We can not buy houses for 50k in Melbourne!,good theory behind his story ""don't work for money, make money work for you"" but it isn't that simple in real life!,Gutted that I wasted my Audible credit on this book, it starts off kind of interesting with $100% true stories of his childhood and then turns into a lot of filler around a repetitive mantra of ""Don't work for money, make your money work for you"".,,The most valuable advice in this audio-book is to weigh your balance-sheet so that your income is higher than your outgoings, if it were that easy, don't you think everyone would be rich? We're not all living in a dream world, selling $20,000 first generation Xerox printers to companies that are currently printing with plates.,,He also advises that you do some pretty illegal sounding tax-avoidance by setting up a corporation before starting to brag about making a buck out of peoples home foreclosures pre-2008 with some pretty snakey tactics.,,Comes across as a real piece of work 6th generation rich kid that thinks it's easy to make money, you just need to ask daddy for a little kick-starter and invest in all of those zero work, high return assets such as property, but apparently, he didn't even do this stuff himself, looking at other reviews indicates he made his ""fortune"" with his pyramid-scheme get-rich-quick tutorials.,,My advice - spend your credit elsewhere.,Very disappointed with this book. He sort of tells you what you need to do with out going into any detail about what to do. The book is very repetitive, he also says to take risks, but no detail what to actually do. He tells all these ""stories"" that don't make any sense.,He is also planting seeds about paying for his 3 day education course on real estate, which I have actually already payed for before listening to this book. I am now having second thought about attending. He makes a sale pitch about  buying his board game also. In my opinion this book is not about giving information, it is about getting more money out if you.,I do not recommend this book.,If you think you‚Äôd like some fictional financial advice given to a 9 year old in the 1950‚Äôs, that revolves around flipping foreclosed real-estate prior to the 2008 GFC, you‚Äôre an idiot, and you will probably love this book.The first half is a fictional retelling of the author‚Äôs childhood. It is boring, heavy with repetitive pseudo psychology regarding finance in the 50‚Äôs and the ‚Äú9 year old‚Äù it centres around is a poorly developed character, whose personality and maturity change sentence to sentence. The second half offers almost no specific financial advice, just vague idioms like ‚Äúmake your money make money‚Äù, etc. The only hint of advice you get is a sense that the author, having written this book prior to 2008, is a big fan of investing in foreclosed properties (GFC anyone?).The book ends with a chapter that is essentially an advert for the author‚Äôs other books - classy.,Solid ideas for weslth creation but some unbelievable and at times risky financial advice could lead the uneducated astray. i.e dont pay your bills let the government pursue you into debt collection while you reinvest your  dividends or house deposits.  Grain of salt required.,Liked that it opens your mind to other ways of thinking. A great story of learning and application of education, it gets you thinking in a different way- the secrets to the rich!,Didn‚Äôt learnt much, might be better for those less learnt of finance, never uses too much detail and so leaves you wanting more,Listened to this in 36 hours since I bought it! The insights he shares are so helpful, thank you!!,I should have absorbed this information a long time ago. My view on asset acquisition is forever changed.,This book had me engaged from start to finish. It was so full of financial and life advice that I reccomend everyone have a listen too no matter what point in your life you are at."
The Hero of Ages,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I am writing this after having finished the entire trilogy. While this was an incredible book and stands alone just fine on its own, I wanted to reserve judgement on each book till I finished the trilogy in order to put each one into perspective. This was my first Bandon Sanderson book and I loved it. At first, it was challenging to get into the whole concept of Allomancy but I eventually did and appreciated every aspect of this masterpiece. The books moved quickly, the story is rich in its treatments of many aspects personal character, politics, government, philosophy and religion. And each character is fully developed to the point where we probably care about all of them including some of the bad ones. The world created by Brandon Sanderson and stunningly narrated by Michael Kramer is not like any one I or probably any of us could have possibly imagined. As long as this trilogy was, I am so sorry to have it finally end.,Sanderson's final book is masterful. I was absolutely addicted to listening to it and couldn't set my ipod down. It's very well written, never feeling contrived. I felt sometimes there were a little bit too many explanations intended for somebody who started at the third book and didn't read the others which would drag on a bit, but this didn't take away from the book. Most, if not all loose ends feel tied up. The magic system he created is almost entirely disclosed and his revealing it bit by bit is well done and keeps you interested. Character development is supreme and watching them grow through their struggles is very entertaining. I highly recommend this book and the ones leading up to it.,FINALLY, an author that gives you ALL of the clues, without suddenly pulling out some ""Hidden Clue"" they'd held back to keep you from figuring out everything too early... He laid out EVERYTHING as the story moved along, and when everything comes together, you slap your forehead and say, ""It was ALL RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME, and I STILL didn't figure it out!!!"",If ANYONE has a CLUE about ""Who/What 'God' or ANY religions are about"", I'd lay MY Money on it being ""Sanderson""... He weaves everything all together to EXPLAIN ""Faith"", WITHOUT leaving any ""Wiggle Room For Error, In case he's proved to be wrong later"" (Which I doubt COULD happen anyway), so that even those of us who have yet to find any ""Faith"", or have had ours shattered, can at least UNDERSTAND what we're looking for...,Just BRILLIANT! VERY Well Done!!!! Pure Excellence on EVERY LAYER, and EVERY DETAIL, of the tale he's crafted... and on ALL of the MANY different subjects he covered!!!,""MORE, Please!"",This is the last book in this series. It is great just like the others. If you already read the other two books I probably couldn't make you stay away from this one if I tried and I definitely wouldn't. This novel kicks the action up several notches and the scale of the powers involved goes up several orders of magnitude. The novel answers all the questions and finishes the series off nicely. The only downside is that this series is so good I wound up with post book depression. You know it is the last of the series and it is like losing old friends. The only downside is that there aren't several more books in the series. Although, in the age of super long seriesh it is nice to see someone actually finish a series.,It is encouraging to know that Brandon Sanderson will be finishing the Wheel of Time series.  May Robert Jordan rest in peace no criticism intended here of RJ but this guy can write a tightly drawn,story.  With some twists in plot and characters that are very well drawn this story is a bit off,the beaten path from a lot of sword and magic swinging fantasy.  There is a really creative edge to his plot.  In the audio vernacular this,book is a page turner. I consider seriously each,book I buy from Audible.  I spend a lot of time in the car and I want to be entertained with thoughtful sci fi or fantasy.  Every time I finish a good one I think I may have run out and then a GREAT story like this comes up and bites me.,,Highly recommended.,I want to lie and say this was the best book of the three, but I can't.  Yes, a lot of secrets were solved but the author lost his focus and seemed like he rushed the ending.  Count me as one of those that did not like the ending.  It was a good book and needed to be written but I thought the first was the best of the three.,Thank you, Master Sanderson, for what was a wonderful, unique, and thoroughly fulfilling story, with an excellent and well thought-out ending.  Some stories are great, but don't often end well, this story was great to the very very last.  I cannot recommend this trilogy highly enough -- an absolute must experience story.  Listen to it, read it, or have someone read it to you, but you will not regret coming to know The Crew.,,And thank you, too, for picking up the Light of Tar Valon and completing Master Jordan's epic tail; he would be most proud, I believe.  You have become, in both your own right, and in helping complete the final tale of another master, a true hero of ages...,,This series was strong start to finish. If you're like me you are hooked and all I can say is you won't be disappointed.,This will cover the first three books of the Mist Born series.  The first book started really well setting up basic ideas that were both interesting and emotionally compelling, then the story went boring for many chapters.  Finally there was some good character development and the magic system is described.  The magic system was mildly interesting and story had some interesting aspects, but overall I found it all a bit adolescent.  The series had a lot of action and teen-aged (or post teen) angst, and felt a bit comic-bookish.  The tone of the books and outlook of the characters are essentially modern yet the story is set in a per-industrial world.  This really bugged me.  The worst case was when a character flies high into the sky and looks down at swirling mist that looks like a huge weather system.  How does a character in a world without satellites know what a weather system looks like?  Arg.,Enormous amounts of time are spent on the minutia of extended magical combat.   If you really like listening to friends talk about the Magic card game they played last night, you might really love the detailed descriptions of the many magical battles.,I did finish these three books as the story and characters were just interesting enough to overcome the angst, anachronisms, and melee.  The series ended with a good completion, but an opening for more to come.,,I enjoy good, long reads while I work. This was not a bad way to end a rather unique series, but it did get a little tiresome. A third of the book could have been cut (during the writing process) without much getting lost. It definitely would have tightened the series!,In the end, I'd certainly recommend the series and this reading.,A brilliant and captivating series. I can only conclude that Brandon Sanderson is a creative genius. I have also listened to the first 3 books of the Stormlight series. The first two books were simply amazing and the 3rd while not as brilliant was still good, Other books written by Sanderson are also fantastic - Elantris and Warbreaker. A sensational author!"
He Who Fights with Monsters 8,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Paranormal",Literature & Fiction,"To preface, I think that this series is great.  I loved the books in the beginning of the series and I think that Heath Miller does a fantastic job with the characters‚Äô voices.,My major concern here and the reason for my low rating is that after only three and a half hours I‚Äôm finding the story to be grating and difficult to listen to.  It feels less like a story at this point and more like an emotionless documentation of events, every major battle thus far has either been either recalled with vague detail basically saying that the adventurers won or (the significantly worse yet more common option) the fight is constantly being interrupted by the author going into excruciating detail about each ability that each member of team biscuit is using.,Imagine watching an action movie, but every time somebody does something awesome, the movie gets paused so that your friend can explain exactly what that cool thing is called and how the character has improved that move over time.  It‚Äôs so bad that I‚Äôm constantly hoping that the characters will be more boring so that I can listen to the story uninterrupted.,Beyond that my other major complaint is the lack of dialogue so far.  As I stated before I‚Äôm only a few hours in so far, but outrageously in three hours, I don‚Äôt think that a single main character has actually spoken more than 20 sentences.  And most of those few sentences have been quips and jabs at each other.  It‚Äôs almost like I bought this book, made Heath Miller read it, and then made him tell me what happens in the book rather than him actually reading the book.,Overall, despite the love I have for the characters and the earlier books this feels like a very disappointing addition.,I know that these books come out really fast, but I would rather wait longer for a higher quality end product.,I was really looking forward to this but while i usually can't stop listening to it, this one really isn't enjoyable till now. I'm not through yet but its Just explanation after explanation. We all know their Power Sets by now and it is totally overkill to have to listen to the skill Definition and afterward get an explanation how that Skill works in the characters Power Set.,I have listened to descriptions of Surroundings, Situations, Teams and skills for hours now without any real communication from the characters and without any feeling of Story development. It just feels like a row of scenes and Situations put after another without Emotion.,I usually really love this series and their characters, so please bring back THE CHARACTERS. I want friendship, fiendship, Love, emotions and thoughts in the usual humorous, sarcastic, loving way and not Battle tactic descriptions and Skill Set Listings.,Please take more time for the Story writing If that is what it needs. I'm sure we all don't mind to wait a little longer for a good story at the end.,This book so far has been a test of patience.   The first five hours have been filler, literally.  I will update later, but I wish somebody had told me to I could have just read some cliff notes and not wasted a credit.,I dont even want to finish this.,I finished it, first 12 hours of the book were garbage filler, absolute trash chucked onto the pages read.  I would have rather had it be a 6 hour book than endure the drivel.  I'm disappointed in a author that calls himself shirtaloon, so I guess that's on me, but forcing fans to endure the slog of word diarrhea you displayed was cruel and unjust.,The last few hours were good though, eat a bag of nails shirtaloon/ Travis won't care once the series is done.,If not for the strength of the previous installments I would return this book.  I‚Äôm struggling to even listen/follow it.,,DO NOT.pay $40 for this book.  Its a $5 bargain book.,,Most of the first 6 hrs is basically uninspiring narrators overview, next to no dialogue.  Fight scenes consist of a canned overview w/ confusing/annoying skill info.  There‚Äôs no context to make the skill info an entertaining part of battle scenes. Out of the hundreds of books I've enjoyed this is right up there with the biggest disappointment.,Despite it being the 8th book in the series the author feels he needs to re explain all the characters and their abilities as if it was the first book just making the book unreadable, I often find myself skipping descriptions of abilities that have been explained over and over again. I‚Äôm 2 hours in and find myself drifting off thinking about other things as the book explains subjects that have no need to be explained again as once again this is the 8th book if you‚Äôre here you know the characters and their abilities...,I'm starting to suspect that Travis Deverell is not the true writer of He Who Fights with Monster.  Travis Deverell just pays a ghost writers to complete these books. If I had to guess there has been at least been three different writers of this series.  The first three books had everything a book should have. It had great dialogue, interesting fight scense, and wonderful world building.  After that, the next writer only wrote the next two books. There was a lot of build up for the final arc on Earth to only completely change the route of the story.  The new writer didn't want to finish the arc the previous writer set up, and who can blame him/her. It was like we had JJ Arbams for book 4 and 5, but Rian Johnson was hired, and showed up to kill off the story. Travis Deverell doesn't care about how the story comes out by these ghost writers, just the paycheck.  So our writer for books 6 got to write book 7.  He/She continued to destory very thing we all loved about this series with the use of MacGuffins to finish arcs.  There was no fighting monster or even real character progession in the story.,Now we have a new writer at the helm of He Who Fights With Monster, and this new writer wants nothing to do with any of the things the other writers built up. That means, ""The Builder""  arc is finished with out even a small fight or struggle,.The monster surge which has been built up for the past 7 books, just narritions bulletins for team biscuit. No fights or dialog during these missions. It felt more like someone giving a powerpoint presentation then story telling.  It was like death, by powerpoint. The only good thing that came from the writer change is, Jason is no long a whiner.  This whole story has becoming the very definition of being anticlimactic. Alot of build up, for no pay off for the reader. Travis Deverell needs to fire this writer and hire back the first person. The first auther was superior in every way.,This seems to be adding of words upon words to make the amazing story longer. It's getting old to determine (ability) the new stats. I understand it's the writing and not the narrator. They have to add words and he has to read it... The stat shit has gone old! the overall story progressed very well!!!,I Loved this sires in the beginning but these filler books are ruining it for me ! the constant recapping on things we already know the constant stopping and explaining every power when it is used in the middle of a fight will cause you to lose focus really quick. Explaining what it does how it's changed and what it can be used again the level that we already have heard about over and over again. This has been nothing but stats with a little bit of conversation in between the main characters and not much story progression in the first 8 hours of the book. I'm at the point I hope the main characters don't get involved in anything just to get past all the stat jargon. I will update as I go through the book I'm 4 hours in and I'm bored stopped and started watching tictok to change things up. Update finally finished this book feels like multiple people are writing this book Heath Miller's performance was awesome as always and was the only reason I could remotely finish this book l. If you buy this book of stats skip the first 7 to 8 hours of the book if you want to get to the actual story of the book.,this book over explains everything to its detriment. Every minor character does not need a back story. with explanation about everything the kicker you get more than one explanation about the exact same thing. I was either zoned out or using the skip button with most of this book. with this book the author decided to double down on what people hate about Lit. Rpg's. I'm done a great narrator can't save a shite book.,I'll keep this simple. more story. less skill explanation. we know what their skills do,I didn‚Äôt want it to end - so much more to this epic story. Hate the wait between each one.,While the combat can get a bit awkward in audiobook format what with the stat blocks, this book shines in world growth and character moments, I'm pleased as punch to have the whole crew together and bouncing off each other again, issues important to the characters being broached and the future of the series being painted, another wonderful entry, this is easily my favourite series rn,I've notices a tendency of the later books in this series to become more crunchy at particular parts where every ability used or mentioned is gone through several times, which seems to me like a bit much, and there are more and more little ""recaps"" in the story.,But overall this is still the absolutely best LitRPG series I've ever read, with compelling characters, worldbuilding and storylines, while still being just the right amount of fun and casual in it's approach to storytelling!,Thoroughly enjoy all previous books in the series, I‚Äôm at chapter eleven of this much anticipated book and I‚Äôm bored stupid 10% story, 75% stat information and 15% repeated information. If they don‚Äôt accept a book return there‚Äôs going to be trouble.,Slower than the others but then it is book 8 after all and the stories action pace fits where the story is at, if that makes  any sense.,Still an excellent book and superbly narrated by Heath Miller as usual.,Looking forward to book 9.,I thought some of the other books in the series were bad but this one takes the cake. The series gets more disappointing by the book but I keep buying the new releases hoping it will get good again.,This book just talks about his mental health and his recovery from what little action there was in the book and then adds a bunch of fluff from other books in the series.,This series ticks all of the boxes for me üëç,The story concept, characters & details are superb,The narration is top notch,I‚Äôm left eagerly anticipating each new book and hoping the author will complete each book faster than previously,An absolute joy & a gem,took a while to get good but was brilliant at the end can't wait for the next one,Finally more conclusion to the story and more still to look forward to in the book, to bad i have to wait until april 2023 üëé,Jason as a hero is a breath of fresh air , in the stuffy no flays hero department. You simply can‚Äôt go wrong with He who fights with monsters.,It's finally out, I haven't listened yet but I imagine it's going to be perfect and a must listen. I'll update this when I finish it. Update: 10/10 Must listen,So, I binge listened to the first eight books in the series over the past couple weeks and now I have to wait for book nine. I truly love this series and you should consider giving it a go, I envy Jason at times for the chance to start again, but the underlying message of truly living your life and not being to serious have resonated with me. Thanks for the awesome work done this far blokes, can't wait to read book nine and beyond.,loved it. the humourous banter balanced out Jason's more darker moments beautifully.,frustrating that we have to wait for future books. I want to listen to the whole story non stop.,There should be a warning with these books. I have listened to this series 5 times already. I think I‚Äôm addicted. Need the next book. Seriously though this really is a great listen, and just love the Aussie laid back attitude. Best series in this genre I‚Äôve heard so farüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç. Thanks Travis,this whole series hooked me from the first book. Fast paced, but detailed. recommended.,The best parts of this series are all here. No complaints. Love the pay offs, progression, new developments and threads being wrapped up (for now). About to Insta-start the next book, can‚Äôt do it fast enough!,Some parts are starting to tread water but generally still worth listening to and downloading the next book.,Another inspired instalment of the series.  It's filled with vibrant, fantastic settings and compelling scenarios. More mysteries of the universe are revealed, seasoned with unrelenting banter and 80's pop culture references. Once again Heath Miller brings it all to life with another really impressive performance.,Third time listening to this episode and picking up new stuff.. As always the narration is superb and I am beginning to think the writing is being deliberately fashioned for the listener, with the real emphasis on dialogue and the voice cues...But as always based on great, larger than life, characters. Heath Miller is amazing, he  somehow puIIs off six people talking together without ever confusing the listener and all the right intonations for people eating, sick, you name it. The less than perfect score on the story is for the repetition of phrases across chapters. Sometimes they add to the distinctive narrative style but the repetition of the political spouses among others didn't! Loved the return of the amphorae, my favourite ever scene. Here's to more of them!,Story keeps getting better, laughs and entertaining. Heath Millets narration is good makes the world come to life."
In for the Kill,"Crime Fiction,Police Procedurals","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","Initially I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like this series, but each time by the end of the first chapter I was hooked. I was also worried that the main characters personal issues would overshadow any plots and perhaps become annoying - but so far there is a decent balance. Angus King narrates this series brilliantly and as usual he makes the characters jump out from the pages. I‚Äôm also delighted that bk 5 is available right now. Happy listening/reading."
Spare,"Royalty,Great Britain",Biographies & Memoirs,"Not about bowling at all!,,Not sure what he's supposed to be prince of but it isn't the bowling lanes!!,,Save your credit bowling fans!!,Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to be immature, but not when you throw everyone you‚Äôve ever known under the bus. I‚Äôm not talking about the royals and their crazy family mess, I‚Äôm talking the ex gfs who finally moved on who didn‚Äôt want the spotlight, drum teacher who took too long in his wheelchair and the ‚Äúmousey/greasy‚Äù boarding school mom. Gross. Far too long and lots of waxing poetic. Get ready for a detailed military reenactment and a bunch of stuff no one ever needed to know- cringe. For someone who ‚Äújust wants privacy,‚Äù he messed that one up. A big, immature finger point to keep his bride happy, family in the mad forever and bank account ‚Äúroyal‚Äù with out the hard work and loyalty that goes with it. Life is hard. Having nature as your ‚Äúgod‚Äù while doing lots of drugs and alcohol will make it a lot harder.,At first I thought how sad that his family treated him like this. Now after fact checking and hearing from other witnesses this is written from only one perspective & he is completely blind to how his behavior & actions looked to other actually there at these events.,He has no clue how most people live, he is very entitled. His problems are normal things we all go through, I can‚Äôt believe he is so self absorbed and a big cry baby. He has had so many incredible adventures and chances, but he just moans about them instead of making the most of his life and luck.,I can‚Äôt finish it.  I always liked Harry and I actually watch a season of Suits.  But this book is horrible.  I don‚Äôt believe he wrote a single word of it.,I suffer from Insomnia.  Put this book on and fell asleep within 10 Minutes. Now I know which selection to choose. Thx Harry!,,You know, before I read this book I saw a video on YouTube where a body language expert was saying Harry is a narcissist. Although, I'm no anglophile, I thought that was a bit harsh. Up to that point, of the relatively few times I had heard him speak; I never got that impression. When my new credits became available, I couldn't wait to find a title and, like a drunken sailor, I tripped over ""Spare."",,I didn't run off half-cocked. I read several reviews and there were just so many 5 reviews. I have rarely seen so many consecutive 5 reviews on a title. So, va va va boom! Come here big boy; let's get on with this read! Right out of the gate, in the prologue; I thought I was going to die. While I admit I wasn't a child of royalty and my dad didn't cheat on my mom, I still had a lot in common with the prince both in privilege and in tragedy. It was still early days into the read I found myself screaming at Alexa,""Quit your winnging!"" and , frankly, it wouldn't be the last.,It's not that I lack empathy for little Lord Fauntleroy but I find him morose  and lacking appropriate perspective. He writes this title as though he were his child self instead of the 38 year old grown ass man that he is; and, given how proud he is of his progress in therapy, it should be. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why after 23 painful chapters, 2 things happened for me that rarely do: I didn't finish the book and I returned it.,,Language foul and found story quite boring. Could have been shorter. It sounds like poor me.,egregious, cringe worthy, martyrism, tmi,lies nonsense and absolute trash. he should be fully ashamed.,this book was boring it put me to sleep 3 times while listening to it. He has a very dull way of telling the story or should I say his ""truth""  I didn't finish it barely got through 5 chapters....he needs therapy  over the death of his mother tragic yes but after 20 + years he needs to move on and stop blaming the world for ""mummy's "" death. I won't be recommending this book to anyone."

The Sinful King,"Contemporary,Multicultural,Royalty",Romance,"Got to the Addie‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take much more of this‚Äù and realized I couldn‚Äôt agree more and just stopped attempting to get through this train wreck of a book. This book is a joke, right? Save yourself and skip this one.,This book was different than I expected but in the best way possible that kept me glued to the pages to know what would happen next. This wasn‚Äôt like any other royal story I‚Äôve read but yet might be my favorite I‚Äôve ever read.,This story fell a little flat for me. The prologue was honestly my favorite part. I didn't find the relationship believable. I kind wanted Adaleine to end up with Pierre instead of Elias. His character just gave me weird vibes. The attempt to make it a political romance was apparent but again didn't really feel like it reached that. I just didn't get any feelings at all throughout the story.,The Sinful King has been on my TBR for what seems like forever. I‚Äôve been meaning to read it since it first released, but life happens and I kept pushing it aside. I actually read the novella first, which is Pillar‚Äôs story and I wanted to finally read the stories of her brothers, Elias and Aramis.,,In The Sinful King, we have Elias‚Äô story, the future king, his path is set. And one night with Adeline changes all of that. A woman he can‚Äôt really have or have a future with. But there‚Äôs something more between them, it‚Äôs undeniable, so how will they make it work?,,From the royal romances that I‚Äôve read, I‚Äôve generally loved every single one of them. But this one really gives it all on the emotions. I was not expecting that at all and it might be one of the most emotional books I‚Äôve read by Claire, well maybe after the Hearts series.,,EVERYTHING between Maribella and Elias was there, the connection was so strong, but how would they get their happily ever after?! Gosh, it drove me nuts that they were always so close, but just not able to get what they both wanted. Elias is bound to his country, tradition and responsibilities. I loved that Adeline constantly challenged him, she knew the stakes, but she still fell so deeply for him. Not matter what anyone told her.,,Gahhhh, I loved this story so much and now I‚Äôm going to re-read with the audiobook! I can‚Äôt wait until we get Aramis‚Äô story.,,Both narrators are new to me, but they were perfect. I can't wait to listed to more of their narrations!,Really enjoyed this book!!!,This was a true Cinderella story and gave me all the feels.  Devoured it in one day.  Couldn‚Äôt stop listening.,Claire Contreras is one of my favorite authors and never disappoints.,A feisty heroine and a man set to be king.  These two were passionate and intense.  Loved their connection!!,This was such a good royalty romance. It in many ways reminded me of the Prince Harry marriage situation in society although he is not posed to be King. Elias and Adeline were such likable characters and I could feel the chemistry from the first chapter. I truly enjoyed it. CJ Bloom does a wonderful job and her French was amazing along with her male voice. It has been too long since I heard Vikas Adam and his accent was so hot. Well done to the both of you. I loved it so much. I did what most of us do and researched for more in the series and found a novella The Naughty Princess which is a story about Elias' sister and has characters from this book as well as an all time favorite of mine The Player so off I go to buy the kindle version of that novella since its not on audio. Happy Reading/Listening!,It was so refreshing to have a strong, female character. The narrator‚Äôs were amazing. The story was great. Definitely a good read.,An intriguing, entertaining and addictive romance. Elias and Adeline are cute together. Its a forbidden romance that has you on the edge of your seat anticipating what will happen next. I liked this story. Narration was great.,You‚Äôre considered just as much as the upper crust especially to be scandalized then you have the balls to judge somebody on their family and you sit on your high horse one is your family even that much better? Not worth a credit no but I like the romance stories I just wish she get off her high horse.  Who wants to hear 247 negative talk.  There could be other things that she can harp on without constantly bringing it back to government and the monarchy.,Loved this! Hot, awkward, scandalous and swooney ‚ù§ Who knew CJ Bloom had a good French accented dude voice üòâ,Lovely, sexy and funny story well written all though one would want ask is the author a member of the British royal family or did they work for them a bit much on that subject tbh for me‚Ä¶ also one thing I‚Äôm finding is getting old and annoying when reading romance novels is the irrational act of the heroin storming away not waiting for an explanation or anything I mean the author builds them up to be understanding and in a relationship of talking and being open but at the first sign of dodgy she runs okay that makes senses to her character development üôÑ the ending can be left to be desired other than that I‚Äôm happy I bought this and would recommend it if you‚Äôre into royals and sexy steamy stories‚Ä¶ I feel we need a part 2 to their story"
Sons of Valor III: War Machine,"Thriller & Suspense,War & Military,Military",Literature & Fiction,"Another incredible story and performance by Andrews, Wilson and Porter! Neither Tier One nor Sons of Valor have had a bad book yet, and this is no exception. Thank you for you fantastic stories, lovable characters and compelling enemies! Already looking forward to the next one!,great as usual, best series the authors have going now but I have to admit i am really tired of all the espionage authors having their stories take place in the middle east. enough already.,also thanks to the authors for not including any 'woke' nonsense, have had enough of that too.,I'm so happy this book came out. I'm super sad that this is practically the end of sons of valor. if I'm wrong, I gladly welcome it. if I'm right. I look forward to your next series.,I love everything about Tier One and Sons of Valor!! They are my absolute favorite series that I can listen to again and again and AGAIN! Ray Porter is amazing!! Please please please keep them coming! I never want them to end!!!,Been impatiently waiting for this one. Great story with great narration. My favorite series. I do love me some Chunk!,Stumbled on to this series and was sucked into the entire world created by these authors. They managed to create scenes that accurately portray an event without being excessively bloody or gory.,Some how this book seems more gruesome and troubling than the others, maybe because I identified with one character more than in previous books, maybe it was the nature of the events.,I know war is brutal but wow‚Ä¶This story was almost too much for me.,I love this series. When I first met them in the Tier One series - I knew they were going to be fantastic. My favorite part was the Heels and Chunk dialogue on the water. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book in the series.,The wait was worth it!  Enjoyed it immensely. Hit the heart strings, yes, good to see ""Heels"" develop her place with the team. little romance always a good touch.,I BEG YOU TO CONTINUE THIS SERIES. THE SERIES GETS BETTER & BETTER. GLAD TO SEE WATTS HAVE SUCH A BIG IMPACT ON THE TEAM. ACTION PACKED FROM BEGINNING TO THE VERY END.

Ôøº,Loved it great narration and story, gutted it had to finish hoping for a new one by Andrew‚Äôs and Wilson soon,I found the three books very compelling to listen to.

"Bright Lights, Big Christmas","Holidays,Women's Fiction",Literature & Fiction,"I was excited for a Christmas book for this time of year but this was disappointing.  I did not care for the narrator or the voices she made for the characters.  She made the main character sound stupid and indecisive all the time and the little boy sounded annoying!  I am sure this is an unpopular opinion but I had to share.  I just didn‚Äôt care for any of the characters except for the old man.  I just thought she tried to do too much in one book but again this is just my opinion.  If your like me and covet your credits, I would skip this one.,A wonderful story. I didn‚Äôt want the book to end. Enjoyed it so very much.,Read this. If you find them low brow and ridiculous, this book is not for you.,A wonderful feel good holiday read. Loved all the characters and it thrills me that it highlights my home state of North Carolina!,It was caring & sweet. Loved the interaction of the characters.  Love feel good stories! It was an easy read!!,I enjoyed listening to this story over the Christmas season while driving in my car or decorating my home.  It was a sweet story.,I was looking for a light listen for the holiday season and this fit the bill.  On the downside, I did find the voice the narrator used for the female lead character to sound too young and somewhat annoying.,Sparkly Holiday novel that is fun and a quick read. I enjoyed listening while baking cookies.,Loved the kindness shown to strangers and the holiday spirit.  Family working together to make the season bright!,Fun book when you need a break. Like a beach read but Christmas. I enjoyed it after 2 murder mysteries."
Wicked Heart,"Contemporary,Romantic Suspense",Romance,"Finally Finn and Savanna‚Äôs story!  I loved it. Ivy Layne does not disappoint. I need the rest of this series ASAP lol.,This book did not disappoint! From the plot twists, the love story, and the suspense what is not to love! Cannot wait for the next book in the series!,I feel I waited ages for this book to come out.  It was fantastic it didn't disappoint."
Ghost Stories: Stephen Fry's Definitive Collection,"Anthologies,Anthologies & Short Stories,Ghosts",Literature & Fiction,"Being read wonderful old ghost stories by Stephen Fry.....Um, yes please.  A spooky, atmospheric, beautifully done masterpiece.  Thank you for this.,I thoroughly enjoy listening to Stephen Fry and ghost stories are some of my favorites.  I much prefer the building of intensity and suspense of older writings to the blood and gore of more modern story tellers.,I have mixed feelings regarding writing reviews ‚Äî as I think they detract greatly from a readers willingness to take a chance on a new story. Opinions always differ, so why rely on someone else‚Äôs versus just taking a chance and making my own?,,There was very little chance needed here. I saw Ghost Stories and Stephen Fry. That was all that was needed and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Highly enjoyable in every way‚Ä¶and I must confess, some of these spooked me. And I do not spook easily. It wasn‚Äôt just the stories themselves, but how they were told.,,If there is another of these in future, a part two if you will, I will immediately buy. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Oh and the sound effects? A very nice touch.,I‚Äôd listen to Fry read the phone book. Some good stories here, but I wish there were more. Fun sound effects.,I have heard most of these stories before, but I have never heard them told better.  I only wish Mr. Fry had told more sories that had not been recorded so often by others.,This is a great choice of ghost stories. I hope he does a Definitive Collection part two!  Stephen Fry is an excellent narrator! He really brought these old ghost stories to life. Loved it!,Too many times I heard a door creep open thinking it was in my house blunt it was just the audio‚Ä¶ absolute must for spooky lovers. This was my first ‚Äúghost stories‚Äù audible and it won‚Äôt be my last.,What an extra tasty morsel just in time for Halloween. The narrator is none other than the great Stephen Fry. Not only does his masterful telling of the stories delight but his introductions really get you in the mood for the next tale. It really gives you the feeling as if you're at a spooky public reading. The tales are literary and beautifully told. The music and atmosphere are wonderfully appropriate. I listen to it while driving but I imagine with the right set of headphones or earphones, you could be plunged right into the heart of the spooky tales.,Some of the stories could start a little dry. But in the end would make me feel a bit uneasy. I also really enjoyed the introductions to each story. But the sound design really did a lot to enhance the experience.,A great performance by Stephen, replete w sound and tones.. old stories that reminded me of my love of English literature.. a real treat!,Mr Fry‚Äôs reading voice is as always, engaging and mellifluous, and really doesn‚Äôt need the assistance of amateur hour sound effects. At one point the same recording of a scream is played multiple times within the same story, lending it an unintentional Pythonesque quality (viz. the Holy Grail coconuts scene), without actually raising the ghost of a laugh. Sadly, this is a rather uninspired and hackneyed selection of  soporific stories.,Meh.,,It is an absolutely brilliant collection of stories with phenomenal narration.  I highly recommend this title to anyone.,Stephen Fry has a beautifully descriptive voice that gives these classic ghostly tales new life. I thoroughly enjoyed the stories selected. It is the perfect addition to any ghost story enthusiast's library.,,Really perfect and wonderful treat for the dark time of year. Celebrate if you dare the classic storytelling and masterful performance availed herein. It's by far my favourite thing Stephen Fry has ever done, (and the best rendition of MR James since the late Sir Christopher Lee's recording some years ago in my opinion). I shall return to this new Stephen Fry's Definitive Collection again and again (how appropriate, given the theme). Do purchase this very intriguing selection for the thinking man's ghost, and settle down in the dark to enjoy some atmospheric, and dare I say it? ü´£ yes!  good old-fashioned ghostly fears. In fact, if it doesn't scare you  you are probably already dead... üòâ,,,,,Stephen fry is excellent, but the chosen stories are not quite there. Could have been scarier if the language was changed to suit a modern audience,Perfect for people who love classic ghost stories, and Stephen Fry's narration is flawless. Spooky and cozy- I'll listen to this again next year!,This is not a modern horror novel, but a collection of old ghost stories, and should be enjoyed as such. Fry's voice and performance in combination with the great music/sound design/ambience gives each story an equally cozy and eerie atmosphere. Note: the very first story might be the most boring one, so don't be discouraged by the first impression.,Some of the best ghost stories ever written from legendary authors. Great narration from Fry as always.,Stephen Fry is excellent at telling the stories, just a shame the stories are rubbish and boring,An excellent selection of tales, superbly narrated by Stephen Fry. Thorough recommended listening for a dark winter‚Äôs night.,,I love Stephen Fry and was looking forward to this book. The music in the background was so distracting I found it really hard to concentrate on the narrative. Really disappointing experience. Please don't ever put music in the background of an audio book ever again!!!!!,Mr Fry is a fabulous narrator, but the stories were too old and the sound effects annoying.,It is so boring and confusing, I had no idea what was happening, every 10 seconds I was more confused than the last 10. I'm in shock at how stupid this book is.,,Great narration of old classics enhanced by SF incredible voice. Once I got used to the side effects I actually enjoyed them and they did create atmosphere but I understand why some people were less enthusiastic.,4* only because I‚Äôd have liked some modern material as well.,Stephen Fry‚Äôs performance is excellent, as always, but the sound effects and music were irritating and distracting. The ‚Äúsound design ‚Äú was unnecessary. Fry's performances of Conan Doyle & Wodehouse didn‚Äôt need sound effects and neither does his reading of ghost stories.,Great selection and loved the music and SFX.,I hope there‚Äôll be a follow-up collection.,Just love Setphen Fry.  I found the background gave a depth to the experience. If you listen quietly It gives atmosphere and draws u into another realm between the words. I found it made my concerntration more acute on Stephens  voice. These are classic ghost stories, creativity written. not too old to withstand the passage of time. They reflect an era of awareness of the supernatural. a time of change . I enjoyed this book.,I love listening to Stephen Fry as he really brings stories to life but I‚Äôm afraid this collection requires more than Stephen‚Äôs skills to chill my bones."
House of Earth and Blood,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure,Epic,Urban",Romance,"If this had been written by any other author than SMJ, I would have returned this book within the first 6 chapters. I don't even know where to start. I cried bitter tears of disappointment from the first chapter all the way until chapter 30ish. I couldn't even wrap my brain around the fact that SJM wrote this book. The beginning was a hot mess and needed a flow chart to keep straight.The reader is literally bombarded with information overload about houses, gates, factions, types of monsters and so on in the first few pages. After you get through that then the over done sexual encounters, awkward cussing and the drugs start. NONSTOP. The book is literally about getting people addicted to drugs to give them super human strength to win a war. What a huge turn off. I absolutely loved her other books and have read them all 6+ times. As an adult in my 30's I'm disgusted that this is considered an adult series. I expected more in depth, heart felt conversations and real life emotions. What I got was the equivalent of Zootopia with foul language and sex. Almost like a young teenager wrote a story about what they think life as an adult is like. The Fae Prince's frat house has a beer pong table and is littered with liquor bottles. Come on SJM!!! **FACEPALM** TOG and ACOTAR had more mature relationships and insight than this by far. I hated the insta-love between Bryce and Hunt. Couldn't she have fallen in love with a merman or vampire or Wolf or anything other than another winged male. (I LOVE RHYS, Cassian and Azriel) As I read it was almost as if she took all the characters from her other two series gave them different names and slapped them into this book but not in a good way... Bryce = Celaena Sardothien. Hunt = A cross between Cassian and Azriel. Ruhn= Dorian. Danika= Sam Courtland/Nehemia Ytger. I could go on and on. Why did she rehash the same hidden half fae princess with hidden mega power. Same self sacrifice to close a gate to get rid of monsters. Why??!! The last eight chapters were good. More her writing style, passionate and badass and would have been perfect if she would have just cut out the vomit inducing moaning and groaning. Overall I think this book was a huge letdown and SJM could have taken this series in a whole new direction instead of rehashing the same overdone theme. I'm returning my copy of the hard cover book in protest. P.S. If you say you didn't picture Hunt as Deadpool with his baby legs waiting for his wings to regrow you're a liar.,First off let me say how big a Sarah J Maas fan I am, and how utterly disappointed I was after reading this.,The good: Interesting world. It‚Äôs like fantasy set in current times. Fae, angels, humans, werewolves, and the like all exist on the planet in a time when smartphones and the internet are present.,The plot is... sort of intriguing - but not enough. I stopped reading so many times only to pick it up again because I was hoping it got better. It did, a little.,The Bad: ..... literally everything else. My eyes got sore from all the eye rolling. The main characters are so cringy- like every man who breathes is staring at the main character with lust- üôÑ every single one. Like- we get it, she‚Äôs hot. Can we move on?,I felt like 80% of the book was Bryce talking about how much guys were leering at her, hitting on her, or being possessive.,The main romance was so cliche. I feel like I‚Äôm back in Junior High school with all the annoying drama. Would not recommend.,Chapter 1: I'll never follow all this complexity. Chapters 2 & 3: I can't believe I paid money for this crap. Chapters 4+: Well, this is actually a pretty good sci fi, fantasy, romance, noir mystery. Chapters 50+: wow, this is really good... Chapters 60+: ... and a little bit pornographic. Chapters 90+: I can't stop listening. Good thing I don't have to get up early tomorrow. Epilogue: I'm definitely getting the next one.,,I would listen to Elizabeth Evans narrate the f****** phone book. She‚Äôs incredibly talented. Thank you. THANK YOU!!!,Maas‚Äô Throne Of Glass series is one of my all time favorites so I had high hopes for this book. However, I found it to be depressing and really didn‚Äôt like the main characters until the very end. I will have to think twice before reading the next one.,This book is worth hearing multiple times. Sarah‚Äôs new world is fascinating, terrifying, glorious, complicated, and a deliciously satisfying experience. The narrator (from the Throne of Glass series‚ÄîTHANK YOU!) is eloquent, has a lovely cadence, gives attention to emotions without melodrama, and knows how to use energy levels to lift and then gradually relax the listener before the adrenaline flows once more.,I‚Äôm re-starting the book immediately because I fell asleep last night while listening, but I woke up two or three times because my brain kept saying ‚ÄúWhat did I miss?!‚Äù [~Thomas Jefferson via Lin Manuel Miranda] and ‚Äúhow far back do I need to rewind?‚Äù,Please excuse my lack of ending to this review. I need to return to Crescent City immediately.,I LOVED this story. I will be honest, when I first heard about this story, I was very skeptical. the synopsis sounded like a poorly written mystery novel with two dimensional characters.,the only real reason I gave this book a chance was because I love the authors stories. her last two series hold a special place on my book shelves.,this story though, the build up, the emotions, the twists. it was everything I want in a book and more. there were moments in this story i couldnt breathe. It felt like I was punched in the gut and I was left in tears.,other moments I literally laughed out loud. the dynamic and the banter characters have with one another give it a sense that these characters are real. you feel what they feel in this story.,I'm so glad I gave this story a chance. I will definitely be re-reading this book over and over. I adored every moment.,I'm so glad Sarah J. Maas is back and she kicked ass with this story.,This is what I've been yearning for from SJM.  Maas is known for her immense world building through the Throne of Glass and A Court of Thorns and Roses series, that it never occurred to me that her new series would be anything less.,,This is a DENSE book.  There is a lot of exposition that was built to fully immerse us in the politics, races, interpersonal relations, and world mythology.  I am going to need to relisten/reread this book several times to fully digest everything, which I am more than happy to do!,,The book is an emotional roller coaster full of laughter, sadness, heart-stopping action, with a touch of romance (basically all the good stuff that fellow Maasians have come to know, love, and anticipate).  There were several points that I was yelling at my car stereo; several times I had to stop and REWIND because I didn't think I heard what happened properly (I'm not a rewinder); and several more times I had to stop to fully digest the scope of what was going on.,,Not going to lie, there were was a lot of ""Holy F***, what just happend?"" and ""Sh***! that did not just happen!"" that were yelled through the course of the listen.,,As far as characters go, there is a whole new assortment of personalities to fall in love with.  For fans of Maas' other works, you will see parallels between Bryce's and Aelin's characters, but that's pretty much where the similarities end.,,Many will be thrown off be Evans' performance as it is very similar to how she read the Throne of Glass series.  Evans has a grit and snark to her deliverance that lends itself to this book and the Throne of Glass series, which makes her an excellent choice.  I will say that I feel her character voices are not that strong, so sometimes I got a little confused during long spouts of dialogue with who was talking.  Didn't bother me much, though.,,This is the SJM book I've been waiting for and I cannot wait to reread/relisten to it!,,So when does book 2 come out?  Love you SJM!,I kept drifting in and out of the story. Maybe it was the lengthy , unrelated details or me being ready for action. Either way I can‚Äôt get Into it.,When it comes to Sarah j. Maas, great beginnings are pretty standard.  This book is no exception, well thought out plot, excellent action, interesting characters, and heart wrenching drama are all here and expertly utilized.  However... i am hesitant to get my hopes up to high, whether it is the Main darning socks on the sidelines of the battle field or having given up so much of her power that the Main is basically only capable of a less then mediocre light show for the final boss battle,  Sarah's endings tend to be spectacular duds in comparison to the lead up.  Still as usual i will be waiting with baited breathe for any hint of the next book.,As for the story, the only complaint i have is that the Main was somewhat unlikable at times, mostly when it came to the elite, her poor person snobbery was quite strong.  Also she is a giant b to her brother and even when she talks about why in the end, i'm still  not really convinced she had good reasons.  though at least with her brother she does acknowledge that she is being unfair to him.  I would also say that Sarah does make the elite in this book pretty douchey so i guess it's okay...i think.  I loved the pseudo twitter flame war social commentary on current ideology conversations that occasionally came up (i.e. Alphaholes)  I thought both sides brought up some pretty good points.,Elizabeth Evans needs to be my spirit animal.  She is amazing at bring Sarah's characters alive.,it‚Äôs just so cringy with its soft core porn pretending to be a fantasy novel. just way too much,I struggled to get into this, had to restart a few times, it didn't click as instantly for me as the ACOTAR series, I persevered because SJM wowed me so much with the aforementioned series.,It really jarred me how quickly the story took a dark turn, I was emotionally invested already somewhat.,The strength of the bond of true friendship between Bryce and Danika really spoke to me, it was heartwarming and refreshing to read a story centered on a strong platonic female friendship!,I will say that it took me a while to connect to Bryce as a main character because her personality at the start of the book was so different to my own - can never relate to a partying lifestyle.,Some very interesting world building - magical beings can enter into their full range of power by undergoing The Drop - a procedure that brings them close to death. What was most unexpected is that the majority of power generated from this is given back to the government to power the city grid - I've certainly not read anything like this before.,By the end of the book I was hooked in and will be reading the next one in the series.,the narration made the book so much more better than what it already was!,I think it was brilliant. This is my new favorite book. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book! I listened to the whole thing in 2 days. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Damn, this story keeps you wanting more. not even one dull moment. I love how much effort and time was put into creating each character, that they are not just fillings to the main protagonists. So similar, but yet so different than ACOTAR. Totally worth it,Had trouble reading through the first chapters of physical copy and did not think i would finish. Got the audiobook and i blast through this so quickly! The story is really good and the narrator is amazing! Would def recommend everyone.,Wow just wow! The narrator does such a great job in make Ing all the characters come alive. The way the story is written is amazing! Fall head over heals I love with the characters,Loved it üíì i have no words. It will definitely always be one of my favourites !!,Well to be fair after having read all of Maas works I still can‚Äôt understand why I enjoy reading this low literature crap so much. But I do enjoy it. Now I‚Äôm gonna go listen to the next book like a good fan I am.,I had high hopes given the praise heaped on this author for other books and the cover art looked promising.  However in reality the first few chapters were dull as dishwater with poor world building punctuated with the most annoying dialogue from potty-mouthed cliche characters.  DNF."
Oath and Honor,"Politicians,United States,21st Century",Biographies & Memoirs,"Premise:,I disagree with Liz Cheney on almost every political issue. I lean towards the hard left on both social and cultural issues, and to the left of centre on economic policy. However, Cheney's actions over the past three years, culminating in the writing of this memoir, has earned my unwavering respect. Principled, resolute and stoic, Cheney proves that even amongst adversaries, there must exist Respect, Good Faith and Honour. She has proven herself yo be a woman of substance and character.,,""Oath and Honor"" strikes a blow in defence of the millions of decent Americans who have for too long been held captive by Trump and his motley inner circle of heinous thugs and delinquent misfits. Liz speaks with the voice of the silent majority, forced to endure the machinations of an abject lowlife, whose despicable ideology is shamefully sanctioned by a plethora hateful sycophants.,,Cheney meticulously documents the extent of Trump's treachery, exposing along the way the actions of a pathetic, unprincipled, cowardly movement, devoid of decency and loyalty. A cult hellbent on assisting a sociopath, seeking to dismantle the framework opon which democracy is built, and install himself as America's first dictator, to the benefit of only Him, His Criminally Insane Family and His equally insane and malignant accolites. This memoir is born from Liz Cheney's courage, her humanity and her integrity. courage and character, like Cheney, the majority of americans are unequivocal in saying- Enough! No more Donald, No more Ivanka, No more Jr, No more Eric, No more Melania, No more Tiffany - No more Trump! Enough,,The world watched in horror and with stunned silence as a demagogue poisoned long cherished institutions -revelled in the discord and chaos he kindled, sowing within those he was tasked in leading the seeds of bigotry and resentment, Alienating long held allies while pathetically courting the worst of world leaders. Many onlookers were struck dumb- the depths of his depravity was at that time hitherto untested, untried, unseen and unheard. Trumpism or Magasm: whichever vile term is used to describe a movement that is morally bankrupt, grotesquely idiotic and intellectually bereft. Cheny's book, along with a other similar works will be forever honoured for standing against a cult whose adherents openly display disdain towards decency, honour, integrity, truth, love, compassion, aptitude, respect, empathy, reason, compromise and peace.,,,Trump's narcissism is so innate, so profoundly malignant, that were he to confront the reality of his broken and damnable existence, it would lead to a mental collapse. His paranoia renders him incapable of acknowledging decency and his delusions hold him captive; He is Evil Personified.,His pathology is so complex, multiple personality disorders coupled with grandiose delusions and a mediocre intellect at best, making him all the more ominous.,,To quote the sassy Lord Varys from GoT, ""He would see this Country Burn, if only he could be King of the Ashes"",,As expected, Trump's fear and anguish prompted him to immediately lash out at Cheney, because like so many Tyrants before him, Trump is descending into an abyss of insanity. Yet, his decline is somewhat unremarkable: it lacks the sexual deviance of Caligula, the ruthless antics of Ivan, the frenzied psychosis of Zhedeng, the hedonism of Henry VIII or the deranged obsessions of Ibrahim. Instead, Donald is a weak, pathetic old man, terrified and desperate as the walls begin to cave.,,Cheney's biography is not only a historical account, it is also a dire warning.,When the sharp quill of History pens it's record of Trumpism and it's evils, let not those enablers who claim to have been beguiled, bewitched and befuddled escape the pangs of Justice. Recall how we pleaded for reason, for decency, for compassion: met only with silence and scorn.,,Thank You, Congresswoman. The Nation Honours and Salutes You. God Bless America,I am a Democrat with liberal leanings. Ms. Chaney makes me understand so much more about conservatives. The book is so matter-of-fact and not emotionally driven, but with her dry humor and observations, totally entertaining. I cried during her description of the capitol attacks. I wish more people could be like her. I hope she runs for president.,When our children study history Liz Cheney will be a hero. This is a wake up call folks!! Please pay attention - fascism is at our doorstep. Fascists get elected through a democratic process. This very well might be our last chance to enjoy the freedom that people around the world flee to the US for. This is not fiction- these people are telling us every day exactly how they plan to strip us of our civil rights. Thank you Liz for your service to this country!,Very In depth. Ms. Chaney does an excellent job walking us through the events leading up to and through the January 6th insurrection.,I'm am Independent, zero religion, tending towards progressive 54 year old man. I probably would not agree with most of Ms. Cheneys policies or ideas. That said I would vote for her in any election she ran in. She is smart, educated, tough, well spoken and fair. Policy can be debated and and can change with the times. But the Constitution and the Law of the United States is not up for debate.  Liz Cheney is the prime example of what a politician should be.,Ms Cheney lays out her knowledge of the events of the 2020 election and the events after it, with clarity and an easy to follow structure. She shows no fear dropping names, but does so in a respectful manner without ignorant name calling. She gives credit where it's due and calls out those who deserve it. If you want details, she's got them and walks through the entire process. If you really want the truth of Jan 6th, this is a must read.,Ms Cheney reads this audio book herself and I felt like she was talking directly to me.,Class, dignity, intelligence and most of all bravery.,Thank for an amazing job Liz Cheney.,What an amazingly courageous, dedicated, inspiring testament of moral values.  Of all the books that sprung out of January 6th and the indecency of Trumps term in office, this is the one to read.  It‚Äôs even better on audiobook, in her own voice.  A must for anyone who cares.,,Eloquent, honest and well written.  Essential reading or listening for all Americans and those interested in this country. Fantastic delivery and production.,but sadly won't because cults ignore evidence in favor of their own reality. strange world,Like Rachel Maddow, I disagree with Liz Cheney on just about every possible policy and viewpoint, but this book and Liz Cheney‚Äôs frank discussion of right versus wrong takes me back to when republicans weren‚Äôt crazy, stood for policy and were rational. In short, I still disagree with her on abortion, commerce, taxes, you name it- and she was real late coming to the table in supporting her gay sister‚Äôs right to be a human - but she has love of her country, rule of law, and the constitution. We have that in common. Well done.,Liz's perspective as lead investigator was enlightening. Anyone even thinking of supporting Trump should read/hear this book."
Demon Copperhead,"Coming of Age,Literary Fiction,Small Town & Rural",Literature & Fiction,"The last few BK books have not been to my taste, so I hesitated on this one. Boy was I wrong! This book is a masterpiece. It‚Äôs right up there with Poisonwood Bible. Some people say it‚Äôs too sad. What they mean is it‚Äôs too realistic. I have family in these mountains. I know this landscape, the physical and emotional. Kingsolver hits both perfectly bringing you the story in a raw but tender way. And this narration is a solid gold 10/10. Kudos to both author and narrator. I laughed. I cried. I got angry. It was everything promised and a lot more.,I swear I need to actually read this book to know if it‚Äôs that good.  I LOVE Barbara Kingsolver.  I have read/listened to The Poisonwood Bible more times than I can count.  I think I‚Äôve read every book she‚Äôs written except for the short stories. I was/am in tears at the end of this book and I KNOW a huge part of this is Charlie Thurstons reading. So dang good!  Is this guy an actor?!? Barbara should NOT read her books. She got better in Unsheltered. Anyways, Charlie Thurston rocks.,The authenticity of her characters is what drew me in and broke my heart at the same time.  The first person speaker makes it all the more intimate, convincing.  I will be thinking about this story for a very long time.,Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs greatest book to date, which is quite an achievement for an author who consistently treats her readers to beautifully-written tales of people and nature. Demon Copperhead manages to surpass Poisonwood Bible in its breadth, wisdom, compelling characters and (no doubt) the most research on a dizzying number of topics, historical and contemporary. Kingsolver is an American literary giant. The audible version add an extra level of enjoyment. The narration is perfect. It adds flavor to the book that, unless you‚Äôre from Appalachia, you‚Äôd miss. I‚Äôm glad I listened to this book. I‚Äôm sorry it ended. It‚Äôs beautiful and violent, horrifying and tender. You can‚Äôt help but fall in love with the protagonist (written in first person), a young boy experiencing the worst kinds of life, from poor orphan in abusive foster care systems to an athletic star until he can‚Äôt play anymore and is criminally fed the most addictive opioids until he sinks as low as he can and fights his way back into life. When you finish this book, you‚Äôll have a new appreciation to the mountain rednecks and you‚Äôll be furious at the system that has abused them, then turned them into the butt of the national jokes. I could go on. I could write a book about this book. It needs to be read, then studied, and absolutely earn a Pulitzer or a Nobel. Or both. It should be required reading in high school English AP classes and in universities. Stop me before I start gushing.,A powerful story of poverty and drug use set in Appalachia with children generationally the victims. The story is compelling, the narrator perfect, it's the blunt, heavy words and phrases we expect from Kingsolver, every sentence sends readers reeling, almost imbalanced. Every bit a dealer in tragic stories as Cormac McCarthy, Barbara Kingsolver has the tools these stories need to be told properly.  I am convinced I will need to read all her books also.,First - I‚Äôm stunned at the lack of sophistication in some of the reviews that talk about the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù in this book.  This sort of bigotry is a good example of one of the points this story makes early on. America is a country full of different cultures and races - ‚Äúrednecks‚Äù ‚Äúpoor white trash‚Äù or ‚Äúhillbillies‚Äù are one of the last acceptable groups to look down on and make fun of in our society. As Demon says ‚Äúthey can hear you‚Äù.  I thought the way Barbara wrote Demon and the characters was so colorful and true to the culture.  Their language, especially the slang is an important part of how they communicate and live.  The judgement of it further exposes the bigotry toward those that live in these circumstances.  Leaving out the vernacular in order to suit the opinions of people who have clearly never interacted with people like Demon - wouldn‚Äôt have done his character justice. I thought he was such a complex character written behind the facade of a simpleton - as are most poor white Appalachians.  I loved this book. The words danced off the pages for me.  When a book is really well written with colorful and descriptive language I can actually see colors on the page.  This book did that for me.  If you are looking for a book that will immerse you into a story that is about the journey and are perfectly ok with colorful language (which by the way includes some of the best idioms I‚Äôve ever heard - that made me chuckle throughout the book) - this book is for you.  In the same vein as Hillbilly Elegy - it exposes a part of America that deserves our compassion and understanding and not our judgement.   As a side note - I watched the series ‚ÄúDopesick‚Äù to further understand the Oxy epidemic in this part of the country that is part of this story.,Have over 15 hours left to finish this book. It was my last unread book and I needed something to listen to for the 19 hour drive. this wasn't worth it. Listen to a different book for the 2nd time instead.,Good story but If the book was censored a few years back it wouldn‚Äôt exist or be three pages long after all the ‚Äòx  rated language and content were removed. I couldn‚Äôt finish it which will bother me for some time because I became attached to Demon Copperhead and want to know if he survived. Maybe the only way the author could fill the editor‚Äôs required word count was with more four letter words than actual story words to be generously sprinkled in. If you enjoy the testosterone enhanced fantasies of teen age boys and the four letter words, this book will delight you. But if you are one of the few left like me I suggest you skip this one. It‚Äôll most likely be made into a movie.,Kingsolver is simply an amazing writer. Just like The Bean Trees, Poisonwood Bible, and Flight Behavior among others, I will not forget Demon Copperhead. Yes, your heart will completely break but through humor and her brilliant use of language you will find so much beauty. This is a very harsh story, language and all. I feel she is a teacher and a healer through her stories. The resilience of her characters renews my spirit every time and I feel like a better person having read her books-more compassionate and more aware. Her reverence for the environment is so often a large part of what makes her writing so beautiful. That element is less prominent in DCopperhead but still present. Always looking for her next book.,Barbara Kingsolver never disappoints. She is the master of fact-filled fiction.  Memorable characters. Brisk pacing. Powerful story line. Addresses issues of child abuse and the opioid epidemic  in an insightful compelling way. I‚Äôll remember this exceptional novel for a long time.  I highly recommend it.  The narrator is exceptional‚ÄîI confess to being disappointed when I realized Barbara Kingsolver was not narrating, but Charlie Thurston was perfect."
The Woman in Me,Entertainment & Celebrities,Biographies & Memoirs,"The writing was really low quality. The stories lacked any real depth or self-analysis. I don‚Äôt think anyone doubts she was mistreated, but there is not one point in this book that she owns anything. She is 100% a victim in all things, and she constantly describes herself as ‚Äúlittle‚Äù ‚Äúcute‚Äù ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù over and over. She also skips the areas where we could have gotten to know her better (the in-between stuff). This was just to sell books and publicly get revenge on her family. The book was genuinely terrible.,I have never read a book and cried as much as I have.   What was done to Britney by her family, her first love, her ex husband, the paparazzis, and the media (especially the multiple host interviewing her is absolutely gut wrenching. A must read.,I've supported Britney since the very beginning of her career, and my life has been touched by substantial family-related trauma. This book resonates with me on a deep level, allowing me to genuinely connect with her pain and her remarkable resilience, mirroring my own challenges. As someone who has taken on the scapegoat role in a dysfunctional family, despite my significant success, I intimately understand the overwhelming emotions of anger and isolation. I have great admiration for her, using her sword (voice) to inspire those who can relate to her story and recognizing her as a true survivor. This book is incredibly moving. üåπ,Britney never disappoints! Amazing book! I had to listen all the way through and I was hooked.,Britney‚Äôs book is beautifully written by herself with a mixture of formal, deep introspection,  as well as humorous light hearted conversational style. Britney invites you in and shares her heart in a way she has never done before. Beyond the icon there‚Äôs a beautiful human soul that has endured so much and keep surviving and thriving.,Story is good. I‚Äôm glad she got to tell her story;however, It reads like a fourth grader could read it. I still recommend it. Great for a drive.,I have been a big fan of Britney Spears. However, this book is so very disappointing. There is nothing interesting or informative about her life. All she does is complain and blame everyone else for her problems and her sadness. I can‚Äôt recommend this book to anyone. The sad thing is, it‚Äôs just the same complaints over and over throughout this five hour book.,If you are reading this book to better understand Britney‚Äôs mental illness, it offers a solid picture of disorder.,Whether or not that has always existed or brought on by excessive lithium, I do not know. All I know is that the conflict between what is said from chapter to chapter, complete lack of self awareness, and glass half full view of everything/everyone has left me in a state of profound sadness.,Sad that anyone wakes up and looks for darkness in all things. Sad for the loved ones who tried to help. Sad for Britney‚Äôs brain which, apparently, has suffered the consequences of lithium. Sad for Britney to have strangers cheering her on when, in fact, she is deeply troubled. Sad that when strangers who do not know all of what is happening, weigh in so loudly, the person who needs help will not receive.,Britney‚Äôs Father‚Äôs conservatorship was problematic and conflicted to be sure, but that did not mean she had the capacity to manage outside of a conservatorship. There are competent conservators who could make life better for Britney, but there‚Äôs no way with the environment fans have facilitated.,All very, very sad.,I really felt that, hoped that, was optimistic that, I would like this autobio. The problem becomes that while Britney experienced some truly horrible things, she takes no accountability for her part in anything. A lot of her decisions were made out of immature spite. Yes, the conservatorship is and was wrong and her family really needs to do some soul searching but, overall, very much felt like I was sitting with a child who was telling me why it is everyone else's fault that they broke a window.,Breaks my heart, but I‚Äôm so happy her voice is being heard! WE LOVE YOU BRITNEY!"
Mr. Monroe,Contemporary,Romance,"Finally this pair are bought together as we always knew after their previous outing in other books. Romantic, dramatic and intriguing with a definite depth to the story. Thank you."
The Titan of Baleros,"Action & Adventure,Humorous,Paranormal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"And laugh out loud, and cheer with my favorite characters, and boo at your villains? How do you do it? How do you produce these masterpieces so consistently and quickly? I loved this book and I love your work. Please continue!,This is such a fantastic series Is very underrated in my opinion. It has such an amazing fantasy world. It is well-thought-out. The writer has such interesting side characters not only Is the main character They are all written so well as great personalities where you need to each character and the voice acting helps so much It gives characters such a life to their personalities. Having a unique voice to each character and be able to tell them apart from other characters just based on their voices. I really can't Recommend this series enough, it starts off a little slow. It's a different style of slice of life which I'm not very into which maybe very hesitant to pick up this amazing series. Cause I'm not interested in life as much. But I really don't consider that in that category. It has elements of that for sure. But overall it is a truly unique fantasy story deserves. For you to put some time into the series and read through it all. Don't just stop after a few chapters in the beginning of book. One finished book 1 and really give it a good chance. Because you'll find that it's a very good series.,I have loved every book thus far and cannot wait for the next installment. Even though the books are long, they're never long enough! The characters and multiple storylines are captivating, believable and lovable. Keep it up!,It's not often that I read a series that doesn't start to repeat itself. Pirate's writing has been steadily improving with each book. I want Arren to meet the General. That's my only complaint.  It's taking forever for that to happen. I just know it's going to be epic. The narration is perfect. Keep em coming.,I absolutely LOVE both this series and the Narrator's preformance. the wandering inn series is a slow burn but its worth it. the world building is amazing and each character has a wonderful story that author has expertly weaved into the most engaging series I've probably ever read!,in this particular installment we get to relax and enjoy the story. Erin is back to her bubbly self and is once again bringing people together in her inn. its fun and upbeat.,of course we get to see more of the last light/united nations company along with more of balaros. its been a really fun area to explore and enjoy.,and we definitely get more Ryoka!,my only complaint is that it was over too soon and now i have to wait for the next book.,thank you for such a wonderful story.,First of all I really enjoy this series. The voice work is impeccable as always.,Unfortunately the story is suffering. The last book got a lot of flack for not much happening, but it was still great and a much needed period of rest after the mayhem and loss of the previous book. The problem with this book is that it's going against one of the driving points of the series. Other than a very select few scenes, nothing is changing other than Ryokka. The writing can't stagnate in a stagnant world!,I'll take offa star for Ryoka she was alright in this book at least she's trying but I still can't stand her.,I am so glad there was nothing devastating in this book. The last book was very difficult to get thru & stressful with lots of tears shed by me & in the beginning of this book I cried as well. Pirate Aba‚Äôs story & Andrea Parsineau‚Äôs narration are always a powerful combo. The characters are fabulous & the social messages are powerful. I love this series more than any other I‚Äôve read or listened to in many years. Ôøº,Excellent story lines, unpredictable events and just all around entertaining. I can‚Äôt wait for the next one to come out.,great story flow narrator is great story format is one of the best I've ever listened to,I think this is my favourite so far, I've not been enjoying the king of destruction arc that much and this had been really a great balance of new characters and back to  Erin and the crew we love. fantasticly narrated.,I had alot of fun listening to this :) id highly recommended it!,its great!,Andrea Parsneau is the best performer/voice actress out there. And I've listened to over 200 audiobooks in 3 languages.,I've enjoyed The wondering inn series immensely, its like visiting family.,Thanks!,what a great book, great narration, great characters, great story, great series. pleeeaase, please release the next one as soon as possible!,Just love this narrator she makes all the characters come alive and believable. How she switches between the characters as quickly as she does is amazing. You simply cannot get this when you read a book. Thoroughly enjoy every book of this series.,I understand the need for background character filling, but I enjoy seeing what the Owner of the Inn gets into (good or bad). I was just about to call it quits on the series, then ""she arrived"" with her usual bungling.,See title to see my opinion. I mean it‚Äôs book 11 so you must be enjoying this as much as I am.,the story and acting remain very good.,the plot lines in this book are far reaching,looking forward to what comes next.,Such a fan! Andrea your voices are excellent! Pirate Aba you genius! I am so hooked! More more more!!,actual substance and stories rather than the filler content that was the last book,Andrea did wonderfully as always,love this series, there's so much content, pretty sure it's officially the longest series ever written. 10/10,Another great book in the series. I know it‚Äôs 40 odd hours but it‚Äôs over too soon. Erin being Erin always is enjoyable. Still waiting for my favourite character to make an appearance.,I just wish the author would Finnish of one of the many hanging storylines and not jump from place to place. the election in Liscor is I threshing but really that third of the book could have been left out without affecting the story at all.,I have thoroughly enjoyed this entire series! Fingers crossed, there could be a book 12. Absolutely recommended this author and stories.,Loved it, five stars! Cartwheeling monkey videos. Need more words to make the cut ‚Ä¶ there!,absolutely love these books I love the swings and roundabouts in the stories within stories makes me smile laugh and chuckle all at the same time just cannot wait to find out the next book I hope it's soon I love this author,Very entertaining story with outstanding narration.  I can't conceive how this is written and recorded at this pace. Truly amazing.,less than 48hrs after release and already 20hrs in. the world just keeps building"

The Mad Mick Box Set Volume 1,"War & Military,Military,Technothrillers,Post-Apocalyptic",Literature & Fiction,"Every interact she has is cringe. I like a strong female character but she is just unbearable.,Lots of twists and turns leading to the outcome.  I could see myself in many of the scenarios and gives a glimpse of what we all know, but hesitate to acknowledge.  Great characters.,Franklin and Kevin are like a dream combo‚Ä¶PB&J, Strawberries and Cream, Capt & Coke‚Ä¶can‚Äôt get enough,Horrible, the 1st book was 50/50, the 2ad book was really bad, the 3rd book is really hard to get through‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,most of the stories in this genre have a main character with a predictable background.  this one has a little different twist. I actually think it would be interesting to get to know the Mad Mic. The accent while not spot on is a refreshing change as well.  Written so it's like a movie in your imagination.,Fast paced, thrilling, dramatic and just the right amount of comic relief. Well done, thank you.,Now on to the next few books!,I laughed a lot at the banter between characters and my kid would just look at me lol!,Good series and hoping for more. Definitely kept me interested and wanting to know what was going to happen next.,Totally entertaining. Snarky humor. Graphic violence. Military tech. Characters to like. Characters to hate. Candy for my brain.,I loved the personalities in this story.  The dynamic between Mick and Barb cracks me up!,Mad mick what a guy his daughter became annoying at times but came good in the end"
He Who Fights with Monsters 5,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Paranormal,Urban,Cyberpunk",Literature & Fiction,"I understand making a character nuanced by giving them political beliefs and flaws. The author seems to want to diversify his main character by making him an obvious Hypocrite and cultural prejudice. This is something other characters have observed of the MC in earlier books but by being back in his original world it has been dialed up to 11. It has gotten to the point where it's getting in the way of telling the story. I am unsure if these beliefs and prejudices are the authors or are the MCs alone as an attempt to humanize him through flaws, but either way it's waaaaay overdone.,Overall I love the world built and how magic and advancement is handled is definitely above average. In the first 3 books the MC would mention overtly political propaganda stuff sprinkled through the books but it wasn‚Äôt the main focus. This last book and now this book the MC spends barely any time fighting and a lot of political ramblings and self pity and crying a lot. He is supposed to be a master manipulator and have smart companions but they just make the worst decisions over and over again that make no sense.,this series used to be great, until the author decided to rip the main character back to his original world. now the story is beyond drug out until you get completely bored. feels like anything that isn't related to feelings gets glossed over while the ""I'm turning into a killing monster"" is thrown into your face every 5 minutes.,I can't even keep track of all the crappy factions there's so much dribble over complicating things. definitely not buying the next book.,Was pleasantly surprised with book 4 but this book has been a real chore to get through. The interpersonal relationships and local politicking have largely been put aside to focus more on the cosmic magic and global politics plotlines where Jason must step up to be the literal saviour of not just one but two universes. The stakes are so incredibly vast that it's hard to care about any of it. Likewise, Jason's kit is so ridiculously versatile and overpowered that he never truly feels in danger.,,The book also suffers from a lack of grounding or relatability. Book 1 has us follow Jason into a strange new world, but we can relate to it because the rules are similar to a video game, but here, what grounding do we have for any of Jason's decisions or world building? The book meanders from one event to the next without really making any sense and you just feel like ""okay, we're doing this now."",,This was, perhaps, the least enjoyable book of the series.,I was hooked with the first book, I love the series and especially love the length of the first book, being nearly thirty hours. Unfortunately the book lengths have gotten shorter and shorter, and his political points went from a side point with him fighting monsters and other adventurers, to him being political first and fighting second. the last actual fight that is really explained and detailed out is four or five hours before the end of the book and the end of the book seems like it was supposed to keep going and was cut to make a new book. No wrap up, nothing.,I love the series, but really hope it isn't ruined in the next one.,I‚Äôm not even finished with the book yet but I‚Äôm already sad that I almost am. The narrator did wonderful work, though the American accent sounds way too country, almost like an old western movie with Clint Eastwood.,The MC is not an idiot, he has very strong views on literally everything. He‚Äôs like that annoying guy in class that always tries to One Up or publicly dress down the teacher but then some time later realizes he was a jerk and apologizes. I can‚Äôt stand those guys, but then again I never took the time to get to know them. I like Jason and how annoying he can be.,His willpower is no joke, who cares if the authors actual views on politics or whatever bleed into his work, that is what the character calls for. A strong , opinionated little Sh**,Jason just complains and shares the dumbest opinions that have nothing to do with the story. I was hoping for the Asano clan to grow but instead they have the dumbest protagonist, ""mr west said this to Mr north and Mr east told Mrs south that jason is strong but not strong...."" dude what have you done to such a good story. garbage garbage garbage. the narrator is great, solid variety of voices but man that story was üí©,can tell by the ending someone chose to cut the book in half that is terrible for the fans of this series.,Been enjoying the series as it goes along however i am getting tired of the morality banter every few chapters. MC, I DID BAD TINGS, Supporting characters YOU DID BAD TINGS! U BAD, MC Inner monologue: ""I DO BAD TINGS FOR FOR GOOD REASON MYABE I BAD"" Other supporting character: Did you explain your good reason? MC: no :D,,Every few chapters we get this and im tired of it. That aside love the books.,At first Jason‚Äôs politics were pretty endearing and a good complement to his personality but as the series progresses and it becomes obvious the author is just as insufferable/self-righteous as Jason, who‚Äôs got the worldview of a western armchair leftist and the personality of a neckbeard. It‚Äôs clear Jason is just the type of person the author wishes other people found sexy and alluring but in reality the novelty of being around someone like that wears off very quick.,Anyways, overall concept was fine just kinda turned into a ‚Äúhow I wish I could prepare for an impending/ongoing apocalypse‚Äù thing.,It's a good story that continues the already established narrative, but there is nothing new. I actually finished this story a bit bored for the first time in the series, which was very disappointing. I hope it improves.,It's still the credit, but don't expect greatness.,This is less a book review more a general observation. The books seem to be getting shorter. in duration. book one was 27 hours and now we're down to 20. book 6 is 15?! I hope this trend won't stick as I enjoy the longer books and like the saving (obviously).,Overall tho, one of the few series I genuinely enjoy listening to over and over. I hope Jason gets back to the over world soon. I wunna know the reaction of the other characters and see how much progress they made now Jason is silver rank.,I hesitated starting this book series as it seemed like a copy paste isekai. The book is even called He who fights with monsters instead of a ""real name"". I started listening to book 1 as I had no other audio books of interest left. The first minutes I was thinking "" yup standard copy paste isekai"" but then within the first hour it transformed. It made its on interesting plot, it made amazing characters and evolved them. It has great conversations, humor, fighting. I was suspicious where the last book left of, but they made it work and I really enjoyed this book as I have with every other book before it. The series has quickly grown to be on my top 5 list and I have over 40 days listening time on Audible. I can't wait for the next book to come to Audible.,I've been a huge fan of previous entry's and will admit I was intrigued by the direction of the series after the last entry - but this one feels very filler. While lots of things do happen it feels like the lessons and topics are cheaper rehashes of earlier points in the series, and the supposedly dramatic moments are less meaningful as they're thrown in haphazardly.,If you're a fan of the series you may still enjoy it, but the fact that some of the charming elements from earlier in the series are constantly trodden over by other characters spinning half baked philosophies to counter things doesn't endear this particular entry to me.,Spoilers,,,This book has the main things I turn up for which is the writing style I enjoy and a great narrator. It continues to add to the amazing world building that truly has me hooked.,,The main issue with this book was plot.,,Don't get me wrong turns out I like this universe enough that I can listen to 20 hours of nothing really happening and still come out the other end feeling that I enjoyed that 20 hours. That however was the biggest let down of this book, everything that happened was dragged out over a book and half for no real reason.,,When Jason first came back to earth it was refreshing having a ""taken to magical world"" story have the MC come back to earth however I feel the half of the last book should have been the limit to his time on earth. He should have came to earth showed off a bit, learnt about earth having magic, gave his family magic and then left back to the other world to fix the problem on that side.,,I feel like this would have been much better while also allowing for a spin off where his family deals with the earth side stuff. That way I could keep the man in a magical world that got me hooked to begin with AND a cool spinoff most likely of his niece exploring earth magic while putting that side right. Then have the family cross over to the other world after a book or two.,,All of that to say I want more of Jason exploring the other world but would still likely listen to the series even if he never went back all be it grumpily.,Story, humor and narration is spot on.,Can't wait for book nr 6.,When you are done with this series, try Defiance of the fall.,I've been loving these books since I first found them and book 5 has managed to continue the high levels of quality that I've come to expect from the series. I love the story, the characters and Heath Miller's performance is great as usual.,Love the world building, the character building and the banter. Great book, great performance.,Too much philosophy not enough storyline,,No point investing in The new characters as they‚Äôre only on two pages and then they disappear.Much anticipated sequel, but disappointing.,The more I listen to He who fights with monsters the more I get dragged into a world of wonder. Heath Miller is a master of voices and brings life to Jason and all the other characters. I say this every time but I can't wait for the next book!,I can‚Äôt wait to listen to the rest of the series,Because it‚Äôs so good,As always an absolute banger of book from this series! Loved every bit of it ü§ôü§ô,Bloody loved it, keen to get amongst the rest of the books in the series.,Loved it, a real page turner. Hard to stop listening too, as always wanting to find out what happens next. Action packed,This instalment had a lot of ups and downs. the author did a great job describing rather then telling. while the narrator is a legend. Such a range of voices, expression and intonation. One of my favourite narrator so far.,All in all heart-warming, comedic but still had suspense. This installment was very unpredictable aswell.,There are minor plot holes here and there but the only major issue I have with this series so far is how often the MC gets captured üòÇ,Really great series, as story evolves get better and better. Jason and share characters make me laugh,loving the story for the first 4 books as the story is very relatable, however I am finding that I am being turned off by the way jason is developing as a character. it is too overbearing, unrelatable with the character being too arrogant with little balance.,I understand that his suppose to be the hero of the story, however, his character is maturing to be simply a child who has been enabled for toxic attitude and over dramatised justification of his disrespect and views of every aspects that do not conform to his extremely annoying bubble reality.,I loved Jason as a character during the first 4 books, but now his little more of a self rightous justified tool with the humour of his speech turning from being balanced arrogance into simply ignorance  rude and disrespectful for most part.,I believe if book 6 continue this trend I will probably stop.,another fantastic shirtaloon novel with many laughs and gut punches with perfect timing so it doesn't feel like a joke or give you emotional whiplash,Continues the story really well and love a bit of a spin on it.,Characters emotions can swing a little to wildly to be realistic some times though,Genuinely have loved this entire series! The Narrator especially. Fantastically written and great humor. The characters are lovable and the story itself sends you on a Rollercoaster of emotions. 10/10 üëå."

We were not allowed to watch R rated movies so we would record all your movies from the television on VHS tapes. I watched them ALL THE TIME.

You are honest and full of important wisdom. So very needed in our time. God Bless.,Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt that impressed.

It's a rarity to encounter a public figure as genuinely authentic and humble as he is. ""Be Useful"" struck a chord with me personally, as I can relate to his journey, coming also from a small town in Austria and realizing my own American Dream. Ascending to become the greatest bodybuilder in history, an actor, and eventually the Governor of California, his life story is a remarkable testament to determination, character, and unwavering vision.

The audio book reading by him is a priceless private chat, a sit down for a coffee. I can listen to him forever. It was sad when it finished and read the last words. Arnold will be and is an influencer and a great human being for future generations.,Love Arnold for always being his authentic self. Keeping it simple and creating rules for life that anyone can follow and benefit from. I hope that everyone, especially the disenchanted younger generation, reads this book and puts the tools to use. The world would be a better place."

All-Night Pharmacy,"Family Life,Jewish,Dark Humor",Literature & Fiction,"I kept waiting for the story to tie back to some grander truth or universality. There are plenty of tropes that are presented, and I kept thinking they would develop in to something bigger than the narrator, but I was always disappointed. At the end, it was just the story of a girl from LA with a kind of shitty childhood and adolescence. It was hard for me to resonate with the ‚Äúcoming of age story‚Äù without a broader tie in or a plot/through line.,Nice prose though, and some really nice imagery. It was kind of like a Jonathan Foer or Nicole Krauss pastiche that was missing the big reveal,Not that much happens beyond the dysfunction and all sorts of addiction, yet I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back to it. I attribute that to the writing and the well-matched reader.  These characters may be familiar to many of us, for better or worse. The story does not bog down in Debbie‚Äôs chaos or the narrator‚Äôs self-absorption and, all told, is optimistic.,The path to addiction is a sly one, the path to recovery requires finding your authentic self and much more. Interesting story of self destruction and finding sobriety.,Beautifully written and narration, elevates the story, making it all too real. An interesting blend of matter of fact, exciting and emotive. Makes you believe in surviving.,A dark psychological study, in the tradition of Dostoyevsky but set in our day, about a young woman in LA. The reading is a great performance that makes the excellent writing even more vivid."
A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,"Fantasy,Paranormal",Romance,"This book reads like a college student wrote it, trying every trick to stretch a 3-page paper into a 5-page paper.,The plot goes absolutely nowhere for long periods of time. Constantly saying the same things in 25 different ways.,If the editors cut out the insanely repetitive rabbit hole of Poppy‚Äôs thoughts (that add absolutely nothing to the storyline) maybe we‚Äôd have a decent book. A big maybe.,The performance is great! The story idea is very good but I feel like I want to reach out and strangle Poppy who continues to be  naive. Armentrout's repetitive narrative in the form of Poppy's inner monolog is so excessively tedious it makes me wonder if the author simply ran out of ways to advance her character. Hawke/Casteel on the other hand,  is written nicely. It makes me wonder how his character  could even stand Poppy. I'm only 10 chapters into the book and already Poppy has either stabbed Hawke or considered that action 20 times.,The first book moved the story along so well, I was expecting great things in this  2nd book. Yikes! Can I make it through  20 more hours of this?,The first book wasn't great but not horrible either so I figured I'd continue with the story. I'm about 4 hours in and I don't think I can take much more! Poppy's inner monologue so ridiculously excessive and annoyingly repetitive that it makes me want to pull my hair out. And while her interactions with Casteel were varied in the first book, in this one it's literally the same thing over, and over and over again. Seriously how many times does she need to throw a knife in his face, only for him to catch it mid air yet again. How many times does he need to tell her she's violent and it turns him on, only for her to say she hates him... oh but does she (insert long repetitive inner monologue about how much she hates him but also doesn't)... I can't even with this,Overall I like this book/series, but I was somewhat disappointed. Poppy drove me up the wall for most of this book. On one hand her brattyness and endless whiney internal monologue of boo hoo, he's done bad things in his dark and stormy past. On the other, gasp! He's so pretty! Nevermind about whatever legitimate concern we were discussing, such as that pesky kidnapping and forced marriage issue. It did pick up in the second half, and I was quite enjoying it. Then the cliffhanger ending was awfully anticlimactic. I probably would have waited to read this until book three came out if I had known.,I read the first of this series and really enjoyed it. I was excited when this came out, but I haven't been able to finish it. I didn't expect so much sex. I don't even mind sex scenes in books. There was sex in the first one, but this one feels like every other scene is a very detailed sex scene. It's just boring. Also, I feel like the plot could've gone a lot farther with this interesting world they've set up, but instead you're kinda stuck around towns or castles while the main character whines about loving or not loving what's his face, or over thinking everything,I just finished and OMG it left me breathless!!Definitely rates with Throne of Glass.,The release of this audiobook could not have better timing. It is a fantastic book with a wonderful plot and the narrator is on point. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book. Thank you for helping me through the 2020 election.,I've been living in this series for an entire week, Jennifer Armentrout was able to transport me into the book. I felt everything. Also, my heart dropped at the end. I felt so many emotions that Poppy (the main character) wouldn't be able to process them herself. I'll just be dying until the next book comes out in 2021. Also, the narrator? Beautiful. Stina Nielsen is amazing.,Everything good from the first book turned up to eleven.  It's not perfect , no book can ever be perfect for everyone, but it definitely hits all of it's best qualities and expands on them.  The chemistry between Cas and Poppy is beyond good i don't know if it's the writing , the narrator, or both but every time they were together every thing was awesome, and when they weren't together i actually missed their banter.  I have not always been a fan of this author's work.  Teen drama being more grating for me than entertaining, but i think she hit a nice tone with this series.  Still some relationship drama, but in a way that makes sense and is usually resolved with some good old fashioned communication.  I admit with the way the last book ended i kind of expected this book to be more annoying than anything else.  but nope it turned out great.  Lol it was a superb distraction from the real world.  the world building continues to be quite fascinating.  The only thing i would really nitpick about, was that for a girl who wanted to be an independent warrior type she spends almost no time training.  and a LOT of time alone fretting about Cas's feelings while he actually did Princely stuff.  Felt a bit Disney princess..ish, likes to talk about being all important and stuff but is never actually shown doing more than worrying about whether their prince REALLY loves them or not.  Also i really really REALLY want the next book, cliffhangers are not fair, and those who use them are sadistic sociopaths. lol,Basically what the title says; Cas says ANYTHING, Poppy's replies with something snarky, unwitty, resistant, and juvenile just to be contradictory and ""assertive"". I had hoped for more character development as I did find the dynamic to be somewhat juvenile in the last book, but honestly it has gotten worse and elicited a slew of eye rolls. The book is pretty much filled with Cas saying ""You're so incredibly violent, and I like it.""  Poppy replies ""Somethings wrong with you, and I hate you.""  Cas ""No you don't, you like me."" Plus 2-3 chapters of actual story. Trust me, I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't quite stomach it in the end.,I read the first book and it was average for the genre so I thought I would try this one.  This book has no plot and hours and hours of Poppy's dire internal monologue.  It is so repetitive and dull and the plot then progresses very quickly without too much explanation.  This based on a paternalistic relationship between Poppy and Cas which is pretty unconvincing at best and exploitative at worst.,Bottom line for Poppy is - she's got trauma and needs a therapist not a husband.  If you can't talk about sex you shouldn't be having it!,Okay this book is overall great. but a few issues to be aware of if you are going to listen or read.,should you get this book? yes,the first few 10 chapters or so were really dry other than two scenes which were really good (which if u know u know which scenes I mean). we hear way too much about what poppy is thinking, it's so dull and slow, repetitive and half the time Irrelevant and overcomplicated, and there's no sense of direction or plot. it gets better later on however overall the story doesn't really feel like a story. a few significant events happen to make the book interesting.just overall interms of a plot I feel there could have been more done.,despite that it is really good and I genuinely enjoy it even without a strong plot there is still a sense of that slow burn and romance, i like the sense of mystery put in. the ending was good plot wise.,in a way tho I feel like the first 10+ chapters were kind of starving us for any interesting plot. so that when we finally do get something we are happy to have atleast something. it makes me question my opinion.,overall still love it. hopefully the next book will have better pacing, and a more round plot. the scenes and romance with Hawke was pretty much perfect tho,  so i'm not complaining about that.,Not much is happening in this book. Don't get me wrong, somehow it is still enjoyable. But really it could have been 3 times shorter book. There is sooo much repetition and exposition.,As much as I wanted to know what happened next in this series, I wasn't giving it much hope. And I was right to do so. I feel like nothing occurred in this one.,There was quite a lot of world-building (again) as Poppy explored new sides of her world. She had an annoying amount of questions. Which made me relate to Kieran, who is often bothered by her curiosity and teases her for it.,Apart from three, maybe four (if I'm generous) major events, this almost 650 pages long book was slow, and if I'm completely honest,¬† sometimes even boring. It had a lot of smutty scenes, and even though they are well written, they are often inappropriately placed throughout the book.,I like some of the new characters that were newly introduced. But there is one that isn't new, but he makes me want to finish this series. Kieran. I love him so much. Not only he cracks me up, but he's also hot as hell and unbelievably relatable.,Overall I gave this book three out of five stars on Goodreads, and that is only thanks to the brilliant narrator - Stina Nielson. Without her, I doubt I would finish even the first book.,I should have given up after the first one. So much constant internal dialogue.,I'm ove 20 hours in and couldn't really tell you what's happened. Can you you how she's felt every single step of the way though.,Narrator is okay, her voice doesn't change much though which doesn't help with the monotonous rhetorical questions and overwritten descriptions.,I am always in awe when an author can make the 2nd novel in a series more compelling and gripping than the 1st. This was truly brilliant. I very much so enjoyed every minute of it.,I stumbled across this series by pure chance but honestly I'm so glad I did. I was hooked from the start listened to both in less than a week (which on my schedule is quite the feat) but now! I have to wait 8 days to hear the rest!,The writing is beautiful, a little repetitive at times but frankly the story more than makes up for it.,if you're looking for an interesting world to escape into I'd highly suggest this one :),AMAZING.... Looking forward to 20th April :) when 3rd book is out.  vibrantly brilliant, loved everything about the story and the narrator .... recommend ... totally.,The second book is even better than the first. Great story line, it made me laugh out loud very much my kind of humour. Lots of action, fights, intriguing characters. Loved it. I‚Äôve preordered the third book already. Thank you üëèüëè,i think this is JLA best book to date. I'm looking forward to book 3. April can't come fast enough.,This is a great follow on from the first book in the series which I enjoyed very much. While the story is a very good one and quite compelling, unfortunately there is just too much focus on sex for me.,great story with exceptional narration. Can't wait to start the next book. Highly recommend this series.,Loved it! Very fiery, addictive and funny. It has its cliches but that‚Äôs totally okay, and I am unashamed to say, I love that cheesy ness. The performance was good too, the narrator‚Äôs rendition of Casteel sometimes cracks me up a bit, but she still does an awesome job.,Finished with another cliffhanger, so I‚Äôm rather eager to listen to the next instalment when it is released next year.,I LOVE this series and the narration is excellent. I was hoping the final book was out but it's not yet. I'll be waiting to read about the war between the two Queens next.,I have to say there is a good mix of sexual tension, character development, and action. I found myself laughing out loud at times just because I was so into the dialogue. I can get a little annoyed at the immaturity of the protagonist with her temper tantrums but it's all part and parcel.,Really enjoy this series.,Me: JLA, I do not like the way your mind works,JLA: Oh God's, whatever, I want to stab you,This book felt like reading the diary of a disturbed 12 year old! It even refered to the diary of a courtesan type character. The plot was non-existent, honestly I can't even remember what the 1st 3/4 of the book were about. Well there was more unnecessary shuddering, amber eyes, filthy language from Casteel and stabbing or thoughts thereof.,The world building was barely there and it's still hard to understand how exactly it works. The only thing we know works is their raging hormones.,It only got 2 stars because of the very last line, which I'm loathe to say means I have to read the next book because I'm curious, it appears something is finally about to happen.,God's save us **rolls eyes**,Gods! I had goosebumps for the entire last chapter! The character's accents dip occassionally and some of the sex scenes drag on a bit but definitely a great listen.,I really want to keep listening to this whole serious,  I'm enjoying the story so much,  and the narration,  but... far out... dear Author, please run a repetition report through your work. I have heard ""it felt like a small eternity"" a dozen times at least through this book and the last,  and I've still got 14 hours to go on this one... and please please please,  stop with the shuddering and brow knitting every other sentence.  it's extremely annoying and sadly let's this otherwise great book down... I don't know if I can keep going,  that's how frustrating it is.,I am so hooked!! Downloading the next book IMMEDIATELY!! Can‚Äôt wait for the TV series!!!,I didn‚Äôt want it to finish , brilliantly played loved it xxx loved the first one then this now onto my third in the series x,3 and a half stars.,I enjoyed the majority of it but considering how excited I was for the next book after the first one, it took me a long time to get into it.,Plus a 24 hour audiobook is A LOT,I did enjoy the increase in batter and loved realising how much of a simp Casteel is!"
A Court of Thorns and Roses,"Fantasy,Epic,Fairy Tales,Paranormal",Romance,"I would like to say that while I realize that I'm not the target audience for this book, I'm male and not a teen, I truly enjoyed the first ten hours of this book. The opening was well written and thought out and set up a character I could sympathize with and understand and cheer for. It was interesting with a different set up than usual. I was already thinking of ways to afford the rest of the series a third of the way in, shifting my purchasing plans around to make room for more. Mean finally a main female lead that isn't drowned in her emotions, is practical and mature, and I don't have to read Ilona Andrews hurrah!,Then the rest of the book happened.,The last four hours of the book was a chore to get through. Our fierce, practical, strong, observant, hardened and smart heroine, became a dithering, weepy, witless child! I'm sorry this is one of my pet peeves, someone who has gone through the losses, the poverty, and hardships that the main heroine had, someone that has had to take care of a family that neglects and hates her in the face of sheer poverty; wouldn't break under the comparatively tiny difficulties she faced in the end. Once more, there was far too much virtue signaling in the end, if I had heard the paraphrase of &amp;quot;oh what have I done&amp;quot; before the last hour trudge I wouldn't have been able to finish the book. Honestly the heroine is someone whose used to having to do what you have to do to survive, putting your emotions aside and paying the cost and moving on; not dickering and self tormenting simply to seem virtuous and likable. Mean, I know women that have been through poverty, abuse and so on, they wouldn't even blink over the 'hardships' the main had to face in the last four hours; nor would they sit around and wait for someone to save them without trying everything they could to fix it themselves. Another star gone.,Not to mention forty minutes on dickering on a choice that really wasn't a choice and should have been handled in ten.,Beyond that the male characters are the typical meat puppet stand ins that exist to make the main character have plenty of love interests, to save her when she gets in over her head or does something stupid and make her seem more valuable than she would be in reality. Really it's good there were only three males, because all of them were blah and stereotypical. Honestly Tomalin is basically Beast from Beauty and the Beast, Lucian guy with a razor tongue that's really a nice guy and Reese is your atypical bad boy that isn't that bad. They have no personality, desires, dreams, triggers or depth of any sort. Since this also a put of a peeve for me that's another star gone.,As for the narrator she did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life and she is a large part of the reason why I enjoyed the first 10 hours and was able to make it through the last four.,Honestly, if not for the strength of the first five hours, I would have given this book a 2 or even 1 star. Still, if you can handle another, how this character that goes from strong to weak, smart and resourceful to weepy and stupid, a plot twist you could see a mile away, a lover interest based solely on the male's hotness and being a decent person since he as no personality, a riddle that given a certain emotions popularity was simple to solve; than you might like this book. As for me I'm getting a refund and nixing my plans to buy the rest of the series.,In a nutshell, this is essentially Katniss Everdeen put in Disney's Beauty and the Beast, right down to the gold gown and the library the Beast gives her, except this time it's an art gallery.  The main character, I'm assuming, was meant to strong willed and hardheaded, but instead she's nothing more than a petulant child.,Spoilers,If there's a single feminist bone in your body, don't read this.  She is forced to live in the house where the beast is and can't leave and then falls in love with him, and then is forced to leave, and she goes along with it.  Towards the end, she willingly becomes a slave and is painted so that no one but her owner can touch her.  She is forced to drink something that makes her not remember what she does with this owner, and then after a couple 'poor me' lines, she feels bad for him.  But it's all okay!  Because love was the answer to everything!  It's all very cliche.  Not a single thing was unexpected or surprising.  An entire race is about to be enslaved, but all she cares about is her beast--who isn't even going to die.  It physically hurt to roll my eyes so much.  I sped it up and requested an exchange.  Overall, it felt like the worst Mary Sue fanfiction I've ever had the displeasure to experience (from being in a car for 42 hours without wifi on a road trip.  It's the ONLY thing that could have gotten me to finish.).,Great adult fairy story. Wonderful twists and new ways to present an often done, overly familiar trope. I was surprised and delighted many times.  Not your typical YA story. I'd actually enjoy a sequel to this story. Which is not something I say often. :),it starts of slow... the. gets real weird... then jusy real awful. if you like books with lots of talk about sex and your not bothered by whether or not its consenual this is the book for you but if you dont like that dont look here.,I really liked the story (it pales next to the throne of glass series to be honest) but it still was very original and the character development was wonderful.,I just couldn't get on board with this narrator. I kept looking at other reviews and no one mentions it at all so it's probably just me.,This book is the plot of a million B movies gathering their narration and plots from other B movies based on Harlequin style retellings of watered down fairytales.,The characters are one dimensional and the story has been told.,Which character ‚Äì as performed by Jennifer Ikeda ‚Äì was your favorite?,I thought narrator did a great job with the story. The voices of Feyre and Tamlin were good, my only complaint is that sometimes the narrator struggled to fully differentiate the voices of the secondary characters like Lucien and Alis.,Any additional comments?,This was such a great, complete story. I was completely drawn in right from the beginning. The book has slow and fast paced parts, but hardly any parts that are boring.  I found this book by chance and I am so glad that I did! This book has no insta-love between the characters, thank goodness. It can hard to find books with somewhat believable relationships between the characters. The secondary characters are interesting and have depth.,The world that the story takes place in is interesting and lays the possibility for an overall good series.,My only complaint with the story concerns my confusion for why Feyre, the main character, ignored the warnings of others multiple times and did some silly things that would cause her to have to be rescued. I also felt that maybe the reader was not always being informed about the full extent of some of her thoughts and feelings in some parts of the book.  But these things are small, and can be attributed to human imperfection.,Overall the book is great and I enjoyed that it was new adult rather than YA, I haven't really had the opportunity to read a new adult book since its a smaller genre. Being 20 years old, I appreciated that the main character was close in age to myself and didn't have the immaturity found in a lot of YA books. The content was somewhat similar to YA, but a little more mature.,A great reimagining of Beauty and the Beast. It's by far my favorite retelling. A well earned romance, great world building, and a plot that keeps you guessing.,I believe this is the first book in a series (cannot wait for the sequel!) but I appreciate how this book is a complete story on its own. Too many books end on cliff hangers nowadays, A Court of Thorns and Roses is a breath of fresh air.,Would you try another book from Sarah J. Maas and/or Jennifer Ikeda?,Yes i enjoyed Sarah J. Maas's other work,What was most disappointing about Sarah J. Maas‚Äôs story?,I had high expectations when I started this book but was very disappointed.  The main character was winy and I felt much of the beginning of the book was redundant and difficult to get through.,A romantic novel disguised as ya fantasy novel. I was so hyped up for this book, this is so disappointing.,Is there anything you would change about this book?,I absolutely adore Sarah J. Maas's other books - and this one might be great as well, but...,The narrator has a voice which sends me to sleep, and I just can't get through the story. It is slow, low and monotonous - she makes the Speaking Clock sound animated.,I'm going to ask for my money back, as there is no way I'll ever make it through the story with this snooze-worthy narrator. If you suffer from insomnia, though, then this is the recording for you...,I read this book when it came out as I am a huge Sarah j Maas fan so I wanted to listen to it for it to come alive and I have to admit the woman's voice was rather dull but as the story it self it is one of my favourites with a kind of beauty and the beast twist.,I loved the story, especially as I knew it was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. I thought the descriptions of the two worlds were really detailed and the characters were well constructed and layered. I wasn't as keen on the narrator for this book, sometimes she spoke too slowly for me, which made it difficult to get into at first, but once you're wrapped up in the story you don't notice as much. I liked Feyre, she isn't always a likeable character but her flaws made her more interesting and relatable to me. If you like Throne of Glass give this a try. I wonder whether I would have loved it more if I'd read the book and not listened to it.,Would you try another book written by Sarah J. Maas or narrated by Jennifer Ikeda?,I have read her books before but this is a soppy romance, rather than a science fantasy novel. So perhaps,Has A Court of Thorns and Roses put you off other books in this genre?,Yes.,Did the narration match the pace of the story?,The story was ever so slowwwwwwwly drawn out and the narration matched but that is not the fault of the narrator.,What character would you cut from A Court of Thorns and Roses?,Most of them,Any additional comments?,Don't waste your money,If you could sum up A Court of Thorns and Roses in three words, what would they be?,entertaining, worthwhile and fandabbydosey,What was one of the most memorable moments of A Court of Thorns and Roses?,Cannot really say without spoliers, but when she enters the fae worlds was were the story really got going:),Have you listened to any of Jennifer Ikeda‚Äôs other performances? How does this one compare?,no I have not, but she did a good job :),Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,i almost did!!!,,Any additional comments?,a wonderful crafted story with a great narration and if you enjoyed any other Maas books you will love this one. Even if you have not, its well worth a listen :),The accent of the narrator jarred terribly with the overall feel. Very immature feeling book.,Meant to have this just for walking too and from work and ended up finishing it in two and a bit listens!,Well read too, lovely relaxing voice and great variation on the voices of different characters, only annoyance she kept pronouncing shone as shown, what is that all about?!!!,I wasn't too sure about this title at first as its a little out of my comfort zone and I'd never heard of the author. However I was  blown away by the story and the narration was first class. Would definitely recommend,This book started out quite well and seemed promising, however it very quickly went down hill. The story is just so long winded and rambling, and the main character became increasingly annoying. I kept listening, kept hoping the story would pick up again but after listening to 11 hours of I finally gave up.,SJM has a gift for bringing the fae to life to depict a different dimension and the strife between the fair folk and humans. She creates a world where I am transported from reality as with the throne of glass I loved farer I loved tam and I loved lucian. A kinder lovelier heroin than throne of glass I hope there are more books in this series,I'm a big fan of Sarah J. Maas, I have purchased all of her available audiobooks. This story I felt had a lot of similarities to Beauty and the Beast. However this was a great version that incorporated some great characters as well as some tender and suspenseful scenes throughout. If you liked any of Sarah J. Maas' other books, you will find this a treat.,The narrator Jennifer Ikeda was easy to listen to and was a great representative for this book.,it was a slow beining i struggled to kerp my self reading. however it pivked up very well in the middle. and i was hanging to ever wotd by the end of the book. highly  recommended.,Fantastic book! Couldn't stop reading until it was finished. If you like the Throne of Glass series you will love this!,I quite enjoyed the story. I didn't find it nearly as good or enthralling as her 'throne of glass novels'  the teenage anxt in this one was a tad irritating at times, yet I still would recommend it. Do not go into this book thinking it is as good as her past works. The narrator ruined this audio book for me. I had to listen to it sped up as she spoke so incredibly slowly and a large percentage of the reading sounded like she was a pre-recorded computer or phone voice. Think Siri but 10x worse.,If you want the most amazing emotional rollercoaster ride then read this book.  full of surprises, twists and turns.  Courage, love, hate, evil, fantasy, magic, triumph.  Great narrator.  Creative author!,It was a good story but there were quite a lot of jarring moments and mentions to modern day Earth that took me away from the story and its believability. But I am keen for the next in the series.,I love Sarah J Mass.  Her world building is both inspirational and nightmare inducing... Highly recommend this fabulous read. stunning!,I had this sitting in my library for a while, hesitant to start as didn't think I would like it as much as I did. More on the YA side but still a great story. Even though set in a fae world is not over the top with fantasy. Slow build with great ending. Once I started, binged it every chance I could get to finish it. Can't wait to get the next in the series.,I love Jennifer Ikeda as a narrator but find I have to listen to her a a speed of 1.5.,Beauty and the Beast of the Fae World with a lot more punch than Disney.,Book rant;,,A Court of Thorns & Roses ‚Äì Sarah J Mass,,I read ‚Ä¶or should I say listened to this book back in 2016 when I was training for my first marathon.¬† Lets say, it filled my runs with something other than a monotone beat (all music eventually sounds the same after a 32k mark).,The first half of this story is long, boring and very slow‚Ä¶ but keep reading‚Ä¶it may surprise you‚Ä¶may?!,There's no way around it. I found ¬†Feyre to be an¬†annoyingly, blindingly stupid and obstinate main character (a little bit helpless?¬† What is with these weak female lead characters?!) ),I nearly stopped listening to this book a million times...Gripping on with sheer hope that the story would improve. Perserverance & staying power paid off when it turned midway‚Ä¶grabbing my attention to some degree.,The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever with no friends, no family and no freedom. Slowly‚Ä¶so slowly, Feyre is swept into the fairy realm ‚Äì¬†amongst all¬† its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.,The faerie realm consists of the seven courts-Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Nigh. Feyre finds herself in the Spring Court which is under a curse for 50 years...is Feyre the one to break it?,All in all, I consider this book good but not ¬†brilliant.¬† I have not read many young adult Fantasy novels to compare it too. Somehow light and gripping at the same time, admittingly ACoTaR was a magical reprieve from the boring reality, mixing classical and well-known features with amazing and unexpected parts. I enjoyed it‚Ä¶.& I will listen to the sequel, because I am a sucker for finishing things off once they are started.,,Happy Reading x,"
Lost Child,"Biographies & Memoirs,Children's Health,Social Sciences,Dysfunctional Families,Child Abuse",Health & Wellness,"it moved me. My heart died for Jess. Tory was so loving and understanding. I'm always amazed how into the story I go. Can't wait to read what's next.,I really enjoyed reading/listening to this book. We had to read for a school bookclub and Jessie took us for a ride down the rabbit hole.. great book, great story.,Tori Hayden does not disappoint! Great story ‚Äì loved Jess. I know if you kids like this and it helped hear the perspective.,I found the accent situation distracting.,Torey Hayden‚Äôs latest difficult case, Jessie, a girl with reactive attachment disorder (RAD) challenges her abilities as a therapist. Jessie‚Äôs symptoms include perpetual lying, everything from what foods she enjoys to having a brother. She lies to get out of trouble and to get others in trouble. Additionally, Jessie‚Äôs manipulative behavior includes inappropriate touching if others.,I admired Torey‚Äôs ability to empathize, and care about this truly unlikable child. Her unending patience is remarkable. Consequently, Hayden didn‚Äôt do a good job of setting boundaries and she rewarded maladaptive behavior, which probably put her at odds with the staff at the group home.,As a child psychologist, I cringed at some of Hayden‚Äôs practices and interventions, though I knew they came from a place of caring. Jessie‚Äôs story is fascinating and aside from wanting to ask Torey what she was thinking, LOST CHILD was an enjoyable read. If Hayden‚Äôs practices were simply unorthodox I be less bothered, but some of what she did bordered on malpractice. For example, when the cops tell you not to question a child about abuse allegations because doing so could taint the witness, you listen. If the child brings up the abuse, you listen without prodding for more information and you cannot be the investigator, no matter how much you believe a certain scenario. No therapist wants a child molester going free because the defense convinces the jury you led the witness. Children who will testify to abuse often see specialized therapists who are trained for these purposes. Hayden wrote she shouldn‚Äôt lead questions in a certain way, yet fails to heed warning.,LOST CHILD, while a fascinating case study, was ultimately a frustrating read.,I love Torey Hayden.  However, if you are looking for a neat package that ties up all the loose ends, this is not for you.  This is a true story about real people who are multifaceted, complex and human. No one is all good or all bad.  It almost reads like a case study for a class.,Torey Hayden is my favorite author, and all of her books are wonderful. Once you read one, you will never see troubled children the same way.  She seems to know what they are crying out for."
Star Wars: The Eye of Darkness (The High Republic),"Adventure,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"I don't know what to say here. there are some things that I enjoyed. I loved seeing or hearing my favorite characters again....and getting caught up. but OMG. sooooooooooo much of this book is characters second guessing themselves and feeling sorry for themselves. that's fine for a chapter or two but it was most of the book. there was just so much second guessing decisions made, etc.. etc..  the light of the Jedi or rising storm this is not. ironically the fallen star is my least favorite of phase 1 and this book made me appreciate that one a little bit more. there's barely any action in this book which sucks cause it's star wars. you'd expect some action. oh well. don't get me wrong some parts are great ( getting Porter Engle, Avar, Bell my favorite, and Burry back was awesome) but we still don't get anything new about Marchion Ro, nothing of significance.  I just wanted much more here. The stuff I enjoyed were great (That Azlin Rell scene was awesome) but it needed more. Like I said, a lot like Fallen Star which I like that book- but it takes too much time to get to where it needs to go. Marc Thompson is fantastic as always- but I wasn't crazy about Beelin character. Character is fine- the voice noises not so much.,just completely slow slow slow. this is the 4th book with the nihil we just continue to see a villain that keeps winning with no explanation. we get no resolution to the plot from the 3 previous books. the Jedi are all out of touch with the force despite this being the height of their era. the best swordsman of the Jedi gets bested by a pirate that was just introduced in this book, doesn't use the force at all... every nihil is untouchable with plot armor, but what is the plot?? nihil win, Jedi sad. that's the whole book. we get an event that happens in one chapter then 2-3 chapters of characters reacting to it, being sad etc. it's just ridiculous. if you compare this saga to previous titles it's disappointing. the voice actor is fantastic, but the story is honestly frustrating to sit through. the whole book exists just to tie up it's own story and not tying up any loose ends from the previous 3 books.... how many books do we have to spend on this one set of pirates?,,I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the first adult novel in the High Republic‚Äôs third phase. Steady pacing throughout, interesting characters new & old, and it does a good job connecting to the prior stories without being overstuffed.,I wasn‚Äôt enamored with every aspect of the plot, particularly the final act. The final chapters focused less on political intrigue or the internal character struggles that hooked me up to that point, yet it also lacked bombastic action or twists to compensate. I could have used more Marchioness Ro and politicking in the climax. That said, I still enjoyed the final chapters and found them to be engaging nonetheless. This went from near the top of my favorite High Republic stories to somewhere closer to the middle by the end.,Beyond the self-contained narrative of this novel, I absolutely adored the world building. I love how the year-long time-jump gives space for the Galaxy and characters to have grappled with the crushing defeat from Fallen Star. This book lays down a string foundation for the dynamics caused by the newly mapped Nihil Space, and I have a reinvigorated excitement to see how the final phase takes shape. In particular, I didn‚Äôt expect to see Phase 2 tied-in so quickly. Once there were references to the ways of the Outer Rim 150 years prior, Eye of Darkness quickly shows how those Phase 2 stories can play a role in the current wave of stories. And all of these tie-ins struck a balance of being logical & interesting without feeling forced. If you didn‚Äôt read Phase 2, it seems like you‚Äôll still be able to follow along to a complete story, but if you‚Äôre ‚Äúin the know‚Äù you‚Äôll come across some satisfying connections.,Lastly, the narration is the absolute best I‚Äôve heard. Marc Thompson has never been better, particularly in scenes where POV characters are going through physical or mental strain. I can‚Äôt compliment his work enough. It‚Äôs probably easy to get stagnant or complacent after narrating dozens of Star Wars books, so I respect someone great their job finding ways to become even greater after all this time.,An awesome opening to the final phase of the High Republic. Marchion andhis band of maniacs have won, for now, but not for long. His arrogance is bound to be his undoing. Marc Thompson turns in another brilliant performance. George's writing is also excellent.,Marchion Ro and the Nihil are back! He‚Äôs undoubtedly the best Disney Star Wars villain. This wave is starting out with a bang.,Marc Thompson‚Äôs performance was perfect as always.,The storyline was good on this story, but I have to say I like the old Star Wars books better before Disney and ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù culture got involved. Gone are the days when you can listen to a good wholesome story without bias, and 50 different references to a persons pronouns. Sexuality should have NO PLACE in these stories. Stop trying to ram offensive garbage down everybody‚Äôs throat. Unless authors and production change course, you‚Äôre going to go broke. Let‚Äôs return to wholesome unbiased stories.,This was easily the best book of the high republic series that I‚Äôve listened to.,Insulting to fans who want a good story and not woke propaganda. From sad second guessing heros and whiney and ungrateful rescued characters to repetitive story explanations that explain nothing new. This was the forth installment! This book was sloppy and extremely lazy. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!! Also disappointed in Marc Thompson for my least favorite of his performances.,George Mann delivers an excellent addition to the High Republic storyline. Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next in Marchion Roe‚Äôs plan to eradicate the Jedi and the cushy way of life for the Republic.,This book made me feel some things. I won't lie, the hopeless feeling of the Nihil having control over the outer rim is something I was looking forward to. Marc Thompson's performance was perfect as always, he really stands out with his voice for Marchion Ro. I can't wait for the next novel. Overall, I'd put this as my second favorite High Republic story overall, so far. Maybe something in the future installments will take over The Rising Storm as my favorite."
The Return of the King,"Classics,Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"Copes of LOTR have lived on top of my main bookshelf for almost 50 years.  I often pick it up, opening it wherever it falls, any time I want to read for just a minute or two, because I can consistently  FALL into MiddleEarth in an instant, and just relax.  Over the years, I've heard others read this...but there was never the immediate sense of being IN Bag End, or the Golden Hall, or the woods of Fangorn.... in any of those attempts.   ANDY SERKIS MAKES IT HAPPEN.   I picked up all three of these together, and tried to do it--picked different chapters blind, from each book--and each time, I've had that same experience I do when I pick up my hard copy, or open my Nook copy randomly--and just been swept in to Tolkien's words, and MiddleEarth.    What is more than perfection?  Because that's what Andy Serkis has done here.,Great classic series. I love narrator Andy Serkis as Gollum and Wormtongue. I only wish he were less forceful in his overall narration throughout this series. Tolkien‚Äôs words alone can carry the day without extremely pronounced vocal expression.,Always fun to be the first to submit a review of a new book, especially one as fantastic as this one. Andy Serkis nailed it!,Best audio performance I‚Äôve listened to for these books! Each character has their own, distinctive voice and the books are not just read, but fully acted out‚Ä¶and not in an overly mellow dramatic, radio theater manor like some of the dramatizations available on audible (which can be entertaining, but also often silly).,The narrator isn't my favorite. Particularly the voices he uses for Pippin and the Witch King are unbearable. Very breathy.,Wanting to listen to the actual books is what finally got me to into audiobooks. The first one I listened to was The Hobbit read by Serkis. I quickly learned about these and got a premium account for the credits to preorder these 2 months before release. Have been a fan for years and all the expanded lore, it was long overdue I ‚Äòread‚Äô the books in any form. Tolkien would be so amazed that his works are held so high and famous around the world in so many forms,I consider Serkis‚Äôs performance to be a contribution to Tolkien studies.  It provides an interpretation of the uncut LOTR text.  My hope is that it will attract listeners to become readers of the books.,The narration by Andy Serkis is dynamic and emotional. Though I have listened many times before, this version brought new meaning to several important passages. I look forward to listening again.,The grand finale of Tolkien's magnum opus and a fantastic performance from Andy Serkis. Truly a book everyone should listen to.,Andy Serkis nailed the narration of all the books! His enthusiasm and skill as a narrator is the best I've come across. I absolutely enjoy the LOTR story and the picture painted by Tolkien but it was brought to life by Andy Serkis."
Murtagh,"Action & Adventure,Literature & Fiction,Epic",Teen & Young Adult,"Mr. Paolini, *PLEASE* change how you write Murtagh. You have stripped him of nearly everything that makes him a likable character and made him into a complaining, strategically blind fool. I don't want to listen to him having mental health issues every other sentence -and not because that isn't realistic or because i dont value those issues in reality.,I want a dark anti-hero type of scrappy character the way he was in the Inheritance Cycle. I want a character that I can imagine myself being friends with or who I can imagine myself in his place. Your fans loved Eragon at the beginning because he was relatable and a youth who was swept up in an enviable adventure! We are grown now, and want to tag along on another interesting adventure that puts our imagination to good use. Life is hard, man. i dont want to read a book about how it is inescapable even in fantasy.,Give us an escape into the wonderful and dangerous world you've created from the perspective of a Rider and his Dragon -not a listless trudge through the mental health crisis of a nerfed man and his lizzard. Write to inspire someone! I want to like this book because I have waited for nearly half my life for it, but that has made this a bitter experience.,I hold the hope that you are writing a larger plot that does all of these things but simply miscalculated the attention span of your audience. I may read the next book but I will be reading reviews first and possibly spending money afterward. Please listen to your fans, sir. We all want you to succeed because you are responsible for a significant portion of our happiness in reading as young people!,it's an absolutely great book both author and narrator did not fail to entertain. it brought back my childhood and not only that but it made me feel for Murtagh that the inheritance series failed to do so he made Murtagh feel like an actual human being and how any person would have felt going through what he did in the inheritance series I seriously can't wait for more.,I'm a huge fan of the author and narrator but sadly this story fell well short of the rest of the series. *slight spoilers*,the pacing of the story was not ideal and felt like it was hopeless and it lingered in places. Murtagh spent literally 108 pages (I counted in my hard copy) in a row incapacitated due to being drugged and kept losing consciousness. The storyline in part three would have been better with around 13 chapters instead of 24 and move the plot along or even expand it. Everything seemed to always go wrong with no hope in sight and the characters were in over their heads. In the series, Eragon has his trials and tribulations , but he's always working on himself and getting better, faster, stronger, wiser; Murtagh does the opposite (except when it comes to personal introspection which I liked) and spends most of the story as a victim. The beginning of the book, great loved it and I was hooked. a large chunk of the middle and end were very tough to get through, the last chapter great again. I will of course read the next one, but was sad and disappointed that a large portion of this book fell flat for me. If you are a fan of the series then of course read this book, but hope for a better next book like I am.,after 10 years I expected more of a story than inheritance sex torture dounge part 2 horrible book,I knew that Christopher Paolini would do this. When he announced that another book in the inheritance cycle was coming out, and it was gonna be from Murtagh‚Äôs point of view, I worried. I had no expectations that he would deliver anything remotely decent, and I was right. This book was such a disappointment, and I absolutely cannot stand when Arthurs try to diminish one character to make another character look better. He took away a lot of what made Murtagh Murtagh, and swapped it in for little elements that were negative personality traits of Eragon, and slapped them on murtagh. I was not impressed. If I could‚Äôve gave this a zero star rating I would have, but Gerard Doyle did do a good job narrating this, and I do believe that he tried to bring this to life, but this comes down to putting hyper focusing on other characters and introducing negative  elements into a story that don‚Äôt belong there. Christopher Paolini has never been able to master the technique of writing outside himself. He can only write what he knows, and what he thinks about, and that makes a narrow viewpoint, because he is so narrow minded he‚Äôs not factoring in how Murtagh truly thinks. He‚Äôs going from the perspective of how Eragon thinks and switching things up and saying that Murtagh would have these same thoughts but darker. Not gonna pass dude.  There was so much more that he could‚Äôve done with Murtagh, I have seen fanfiction that have been written better. And that‚Äôs saying something, because most of the fanfiction for the inheritance cycle is  really bad. But this was just a complete waste of money, And I‚Äôm just disappointed and heartbroken that Murtagh and thorn never truly got to have peace, and we never saw the healing that was supposed to happen for them. The elements of the relationships that he puts in this book are dysfunctional at best. Murtagh is constantly lured in by obvious and  Blayton traps then any child can see through. Where did his self preservation go,  it‚Äôs as if he has no clue how to navigate the political economical or social landscape of Alagacia, even though he has been trained from childhood to recognize  manipulations and machinations of nefarious people. That‚Äôs how he survived in Galbatoric‚Äôs court. You don‚Äôt just lose those kind of skills. So, if people get confused by when I say that he diminished Murtagh. This is what I‚Äôm talking about. I just felt like Christopher Paolini should have learned his lesson from all the plot holes he had in the first four books. But this is a person who won is riding on the cocktails of his success. His success came at a time when many people warn it to read high fantasy. They were impressed by his age that he was able to combined so many well-known tropes into one book, but he‚Äôs an older man now, he‚Äôs lived a little bit of life, and he should be better than this, but he isn‚Äôt. I will say this there is a serious disparity between skill and natural talent. I believe that Christopher Paolini had some natural talent, but if you don‚Äôt back up the natural talent with real skills, it just goes nowhere you will plateau. This was not OK. He really should have fixed the problems in his writing in the way, he thinks, or go get another job and start thinking about something else to do with his life.,if ur going to make a new hero, then like... make the hero. even if he's an anti hero. very disappointed. I just kept waiting for the new ""main character"" to actually do something. just kept making one stupid decision after another. he had so much potential to actually have good story but instead it's brooding and crap decision making.,like the author sets up something then never uses it. like ur just waiting for the story to move on and for things to happen and it just doesn't. I'm not sure I'd even listen to the next book if he even writes it.,I for the life of me can't understand why there's good reviews, did people listen to the same book as me??,Incredible! Just what I needed! I started listening to this series in high school. Then throughout my undergraduate degree this series served as part of a routine for going to sleep.,Now as I am wrapping up my graduate degree‚Ä¶ a NEW BOOK DROPPED! ü´® I was so hyped and nervous that it wouldn‚Äôt live up to my expectations and standards‚Ä¶ but all that was for nothing!,Christopher Paolini and Gerard Doyle are backkkk baby!,This was such a blessing! Great work and God Bless!,,Dragons, witches, werecats, magic, vague RPG structure. I emphatically suggest reading or listening to books 1-4 of the series to wholly enjoy the treat this is. All the characters and an organic plot continuation of the previous books; not forced, not a repeat, not what many think Star Wars did when they continued their franchise. If your looking for the blessed-touched journey that Eragon and Saphira had and aren't interested in a darker-strife touched journey then try it but it might or might not be your taste. If you genuinely love the characters and world and all of it's good, it's bad, it's beautiful and it's conflict then this is what you're scared to hope for.,Disclaimer: I am a die-hard fan of the first four Inheritance books, my favorite is Eldest, my dogs are named Brom, Saphira and Eragon. From here out this review will probably resonate the most with those of the like.,I didn't expect this book to be up to the standard of the Inheritance Cycle. I expected it to be more along the lines of The Fork, The Witch and the Wyrm; entertaining but not profoundly engaging like I find the Inheitance ('Eragon') books. I am very pleasantly surprised. To compare it to the Inheritance series I would liken it to a mixture of Eragon And Brisingr combined; the pacing, the character conflict, the emotions conveyed. That being said the plot is wholly unique, another thing that I didn't have expectations for. I thought there would be a shade of repetition or at least subtle similarities in Murtagh and Thorns journey. No, it is a journey unto its own. However, it is fully integrated into the first four books, I would even call it the fifth.,Murtagh and Thorn are struggling to deal their inheritance they've recieved from the same forbear-ers that Eragon and Saphira had. The way Paoloni wrote the characters with consideration of the psychology that the love and nurturing one set grew in and the neglect and strife the others were raised in is very well conveyed, well considered and intuitive; a nature v. nuture allegory.,I won't give any spoilers sweetie, just that rambling review in hopes that it'll excite you like you should be.,I love it, all the stars.,,Loved the inheritance books and I liked Murtagh in the original series but this book paints him into an incompetent fool. He had ample opportunities to take control of the situation and always made the absolute worst decision possible over and over. It is painful. He gets his butt kicked by almost everyone or everything he meets. Thorn is pretty much useless and the story as a whole is just boring minus a few short moments. Not sure what happened, and why the author saw fit to destroy an awesome character. I will listen to the next book he puts out but I hope it‚Äôs better than this one. Narrator was great as usual but the story just didn‚Äôt hit the mark at all unfortunately.,Forced. Forced. Forced. ‚ÄîLike ground processed meat pressed through an orifice that now only resembles what it was before, wrapped in plastic.,So‚Ä¶,When the author says the writing went quickly, I think he is lying. This was not some smooth sailing writ. Rather, it seems like a fight: agony of will power, that never hits a critical mass of flow. ‚ÄîYou know- that flow that makes a story enjoyable and unpredictable? Well, he misses it.,,It reads like a slog, with wholly predictable results.  - Wordy, but lacking: as if, he tried to recapture the essence of the 13 yr old, uninhibited genius, but all we get is the adulty darkness of a cynic who has lost the joy.,,,On the other hand, this is a fine study of the potential challenges of adulthood; when idealistic philosophy of youth gives way to the continuum of acquiescence that turns dreams into ambitions, and then the general retardation of what we cannot repel. I do sympathize. I just don‚Äôt like it."
The Blood Witch,Paranormal,Romance,"I Love all of the books in these series and I can‚Äôt wait for the next book and seeing all the new magic and new story!,As with all the other books in this series.

Third Eye,,,"The problem with this book is that it is not a book. Its labeled as an 'audiobook' so that is what I thought it was and definitely what I was expecting. Sadly, it is not a book. It's an audio performance. What does that mean?,,It means, that instead of this being a book, it's really like a sitcom television script. So imagine that instead of listening to someone read a book, you just listened to a TV show with your eyes closed. That's what ""Third Eye"" is all about.,,The next biggest issue is that the story is not all that great. They took 'subvert your expectations' to the Nth degree because apparently they thought it was funny. The 'hero' has no self confidence and fails at everything. The sidekicks are generally terrible people that actively thwart the hero and make living with her more miserable, and the whole story just kind of bumbles along. At least it did for a couple of hours. That's as far as I could make it before I found myself actively rooting for the bad guys to show-up and end it all.,,I am guessing the overwhelming good reviews are from the fan club.,,Oh, and apparently they forgot to edit out the advertisement for the kickstarter or whatever that happens after the first chapter. So if you are not sure if this 'book' is for you, you can presumably find the first chapter floating around online for free.,This is so much fun! The whole cast is obviously enjoying the story and narrating it. As a listener, I also enjoy it very much.,,The story (and story-telling) has a laugh-out-loud sense of humor. Although the performance is on the high-energy side, and some of the characters are a bit hyper, it works for the story, and the calm and charming narrator, Neil Gaiman, balances it well. The occasional soundtrack is excellent, too.,,It's perfect as a long weekend entertainment and/or to go along with a drink.,,If you like this book, check out ""Good Omens, A Full Cast Production"" by Neil Gaiman's, which is also a fun fantasy story with extraordinary performers. If you like the full cast format and the fantasy theme but want something more epic story-wise, check out Neil Gaiman's ""The Sandman"".,I frequently have problems with ensemble performances. One or more voice being extremely annoying. That's tolerable if they're infrequent.  This time they were main characters. This was probably because the story was being cutesy and dumb. The combination made be stop before listening to much of the book: I gave the story the benefit of the doubt and gave it 3 instead of 2 stars.,,Bottom line was I wouldn't want to be around these characters in real life and the story seemed to be dumb pompous people doing dumb pompous things.,Just what we all needüî• hilarious, charming, goofy, and ironically heartwarming. Young girl, washed up failed chosen one, cast of great characters, amazing voice acting - like firefly, Buffy the vampire slayer, the guild, Janet evanovich novels, and every favorite urban fantasy rolled up with some Felicia day magic‚Ä¶time to light it up!,I really enjoyed the story, and I don't normally fall into the fantasy genre, but when I saw it was by Felicia Day.  I had to check it out.  The story is really fun, Comedic and a bit cheesy at times ( in a good way, of course), but it also has it's serious, heart-felt moments In the story, making it a good balance of the two. The cast performance is what really did it for me. They definitely made it that much more enjoyable, and I was also pleased to find out that Troy Baker, Christopher Judge, and Lily Pichu were a few names I also recognized as casting members. overall, it's solid, and I definitely recommend this one.,Laurel Pettigrew, a not-so-ordinary girl thrust into an extraordinary situation, is relatable and endearing. Her journey from supposed Chosen One to pariah is a rollercoaster of emotions, humor, and heart.  It combines a fresh and captivating narrative, well-rounded characters, and phenomenal performance from and extraordinary cast make this one of the most fun experiences  to listen to and enjoy.,Welcome Seeker, I have the answers to all your questions.,Felicia is a natural storyteller.  Her creativity, writing and passion shines as she weaves her Third Eye tale. The story is hilarious & charming with heart & depth, filled with heartwarming and heartfelt moments of pure joy, laughter and fun.   I can't say enough about the cast as the characters & world of Third Eye effortlessly comes to life in the most magical and fun way just as Felicia envisioned it.,After 5 years, 400 pages, 1 epic adventure, Congratulations Felicia.  Thanks for inviting us to your world,I just love this performance.  Than you Miss Felicia for making this wonderful work of art.!,I adore Felicia Day and have since...Buffy? The Guild? Dr. Horrible? It's hard to say. I couldn't help but pre-order this as a result, even knowing little about it, and I'm so glad I did. This story is fantastic and unique, beautifully performed. I haven't heard an audio book before that's so much like just hearing a staged show. I loved the world and characters, and dearly hope that Felicia carries on with it, turning Third Eye into the first of a series. I've been on the fence for so long about audio books, and if more were like this, I'd have been won over long since.,You never know when you start a new book if the world will grab you or leave you bored to tears.

The cast all did an amazing job , stand outs for me were London Hughes, wil Wheaton, Sean Astin and Janet Varney, also love that troy Baker snook a line in!! I think this is going to be an audio book I come back to again and again,Felicia did amazing job and i loved every second of it.   So many known and great voices made this experience to be best audiobook i ever heard. It all well put together, and the story is one of a kind.,It felt like I was reading the third book of a trilogy and I was very lost while reading it. It kept mentioning things that happened in other stories and I get there were books within the books but it wasn't those I was getting confused about. All the magic folks seemed to have history they were talking about and mentioned situations but no further exposition. I got annoyed with this and turned it off.,The performances were really good though.,I loved everything about this book. The voice actors are perfection and I've struggled to find a lot of good fantasy lately. loved the wee nerdy nods here and there.,Brilliant performance by all of the cast and a great story.  Hopefully, there will be more featuring the same characters,As a few people has mentioned, this is more like a radio play than an audiobook. The acting is well done and the story is engaging and fun. Even the narrator is a separate character in the story with their own view and opinions on the story. I had a blast and I hope there are more shows like this coming from Felicia Day.,the story was fun. lotsa fun. but I kinda expected more because of the cast.,Neil Gaiman really pulled it all together... if you are a fan, this is fun.

He Who Fights with Monsters 9,"Action & Adventure,Epic,Paranormal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"This series may have run its course.  Not sure - I'm mulling whether I should keep giving it a chance to turn around.,,The author spends a LARGE amount of time having every side character worship the self-admitted moron that is Jason.  Jason has spent a small fraction of the time in the magic world but he is somehow a god.  A socialist, money spending high cotton socialist apparently...,,The growth of the character flip flops.  He has a nervous breakdown - regrets his actions.  He is built up time and time again - and then does the exact same actions OVER AND OVER.  The worst part is how most conversations are how awesome Jason is - how amazing he is - how insanely powerful and cool he is - chapter after mind-numbing chapter.  The power advancement that was present in the first couple of books is completely gone and ithe action and intrigue is now replaced with soap opera drama and politics.   Jason is two steps ahead of everyone.  He manipulates every conversation even when being goofy.  Its just hollow... I want to believe Shirtaloon can turn this around.,Gone are the days of adventuring and Jason healing the poor. The first fight scene goes like this ‚Äúoh no a bunch of gold rankers‚Äù. After the fighting everyone was captured. Then Jason explains how crazy powerful is he now.,I should have stopped 2 books ago.,15 hours and 30 minutes it took 15 hours and 30 minutes to get the group Fighting together again really,I highly doubt anyone is starting the series with this book so why is there so much recap. I dreaded the introduction of every new character because I knew it would mean at least 20 minutes of the stuff already said. The discussions of morality on every decision Jason make are tedious, far too long and frequent. I stuck around because I liked the world the author created, it‚Äôs too bad we spend so little time in it and spend so much in pointless dialogue.,Listening Speed: 1.9,This book has all of the elements that made me think of this series as the best LitRPG to date! Action, humor, surprises, all while progressing the story and characters forward. This book lives up to the great story the series started with!,Loads of content in this book. Tons of great moments (plus one of my favorite Clive moments), cool fights that are NOT cosmos-defining, and just some good ol' fashioned adventuring. Plus a pretty epic battle to boot. This is my favorite book since book 1/2, except this one has much better mechanical writing. Shirtaloon has been able to dial done the ""he said/she said"" back and forth that plagued the first couple of books. While there are still moments of repeating things, that's also not as heavy-handed as it used to be.,,If you've made it this far, NINE books in, then you should already know what you're getting with the characters and story. Leaving a review saying, ""but Jason is like this and that and the author writes like this!"" is dumb, because that hasn't *really* changed too much in the last 9 books. Jason is still Jason, just more powerful.,,""The narrator does all females the same as well - feathery and whispery."",,I don't mind the sultry voices Heath Miller uses for females, however you can tell that he doesn't have a TON of range in that aspect and is one of his (few) shortcomings. I know he works for Podium Audio, but my Audio Dream Team of narrators for one of these books would be Heath Miller narrating and voicing Jason and Clive, Annie Ellicott voicing the female characters, and Jeff Hays voicing the remaining characters (including a few female characters maybe).,I read the book before but the voice acting makes it 100 times better.,I did preorder and I was hoping or expecting something extra special. It's just more of the same. exactly the same :) but it IS time for the story to move forward. jabbering about biscuits for 47minutes... lost its shine....,author in love with his own wit, ‚úÖ. author in love with his MC, ‚úÖ. MC that is a psychopath trying to pretend to not be, ‚úÖ. supporting characters that are just there to enable the psychopath to pretend to be normal, ‚úÖ. the story barely proceeded, ‚úÖ I have made it through each of the last three books on the hope that the author is working up to something in the next book. each time I got the next book I was disappointed.

That trick should not be overused.,The story is really slow to get anywhere the first half of the book is exploring his mental and emotional health which I don't believe will ever change at this point and then starting to adventure again and getting caught up in the messenger invasion.,My main gripes with the story is that dispute the cool world and need to grow stronger the plot is overshadowed by Jason's constant instabilities that every book I think is solved or getting there and then bam it's back I can totally dig an emotionaly charged situation with complex issues but it's just dragged on and on and on and on, and the worst thing is that the people around him give him advice and he sees a path to get better or remove himself from the area and just be a normal adventure for a while and instead of using his portal powers to do so he's larking around doing the same things in a area not that far away.,Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode. No, I really can‚Äôt wait! I might have to buy the books!,I loved the previous books, but this book has lost what made them great, the travel, adventure, magic and leveling up. Jason is now a moaning worthless cry baby who is now trying to avoid all conflict, I'm sick of all the politics, Get back to the exciting quests and battles getting new abilities.,Best one yet. No spoilers but CLIVE it‚Äôs the GOAT can‚Äôt wait for the next,,Really good story with some nice twists and turns that captures your attention.,Waiting for the next book in the series,The series is getting very anime, every sequel there's a new bigger badder challenge to overcome... yawn.... there's so much more that could be done away from Jason Assano, there's new earthlings in this world now, how about some decent side developement stories. Tyka should have had his own quirky side plot fighting his way through Lyonnid territory, maybe some light hint at fury entanglements. Fu*k Jason's team of predictable adventuring wan-k monkeys,This is a great book series and I can‚Äôt wait for more but Jason this book has been very annoying he caused most of his problems when they could of been easily solved and not a big fan that he has been made so heavily mentally reliant on his team I wish he was given more time to handle his issues so he can stop being so rash and angry at any authority figure just because he doesn‚Äôt like authority figures,The humour delivery in this series is absolutely sublime! The narration is fantastic and the story absolutely fantastic and engaging. I have loved every single book so far. And there has been absolutely no loss in quality.,Holy hell, the amount of im good, but I'm bad, I hate authority like he's meant to be silver yet can beat golds etc, just all too much.,With such a cool world and idea, Jason just ruins it.,First few books was awesome but going to earth and back just boring and can't stand Jason with his constant inner turmoil.,Listen to all nine audiobooks on the trot and can‚Äôt wait for the 10th. Can‚Äôt recommend a better books to listen to.,I started out this series as thinking this is just an absolute amazing writer and the story is top notch, 5 stars all the way, but now it is becoming just so god awful boring and annoying. The constant blah blah about nothing is just over the top. But I will say it is not a surprise, when it comes to litrpg writers, they suffer from the same diseases, when they can not figure out how to continue the story they drown on about mechanics and rules from a universe that you just start to tune out. I want more from these writers that write this genre, but they seems to fail when it comes to the long game, I wish I could sit here and write how great this series is shaping out to be, but it‚Äôs not, the imagination is getting lost, I will continue to listen to this series but hope it gets better,Yeah this is losing me a lot,What‚Äôs happening to the writer,Excitement is gone,Quality over quantity mate .,Love hearing more of Taika. What goes splendidly with Biscuits? Hot Chocolate! I devoured this way too fast is my only regret right now.,I would listen to this man read his shopping list and Jason is one of my favourite characters of all time. I recommend 100000% everyone should listen or read this series.,Love the story and the voices this book has kept me sane during work hours,I'm glad i gave litrpg a go,  got sucked in real fast. not sure if i reviewed others in this series but it's funny, detailed, complete, and the story is expectant. looking forward to seeing how things turn out,This amazing story keeps getting better and better! Who knew I was missing Aussie flair in my fantasy genre,Highly recommend.,Shirtaloon and Heath, well done.,Laughs and edge of the seat listening! Thanks,This is an amazing story.  The Australian accent is on point and I love the quips and funniness of this series,Great books totally absorbed into the storyline.,I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!!! One of my fav narrators!"
The Eye of the World,Epic,Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The Eye of the World kicks off Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series and it is a step that should not be taken lightly. This first book is excellent and will likely have you listening to the next book in the journey before you know it. This is a long series (13+ books) and each book so far is between 23-41 hours of listening in unabridged format.,,Some things you should know before you start:,,1) Robert Jordan did not live long enough to finish the story, but he did pass along his vision for the conclusion to Brandon Sanderson  who is writing the final books. Brandon Sanderson is an awesome Fantasy writer so the conclusion of the series is in good hands.,,2) Robert Jordan can tend to be wordy at times and some of the books along the way feel a little bloated, but each one does advance the story.,,3) The narration is done by 2 excellent narrators: Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. Each chapter will be read by one or the other depending on the chapter's main character. If the main character is female then Kate will read the entire chapter including the male voices. Michael will handle the chapters where the main character is male and he will do the female voices. This means that you must get accustomed to 2 voices for each character.  This put me off at first but I quickly became accustomed to it and now I really enjoy the format.,,4) After a few books the narrators change the way they pronounce certain character names and this can throw you off until you realize that it is just a pronunciation change and not a different character. Just be prepared for it.,,I am glad I started this long journey and I feel that audio is one of the best ways to experience Jordan's work. I had read The Eye of the World years ago but it didn't inspire me to keep going forward in the series, where the audiobook left me wanting more!,I am writing this review on the first of this series because as you consider beginning a multibook series you'll be wondering if the commitment is worth it. After having listened to all of the books now available on Audible (10 or 11 and the story is still not over) I am telling you to GO FOR IT. It took a several chapters to get my bearings with the material, but after that I was hooked in a terribly engrossing world of fantasy that I would never have thought would interest me. Some other reviewers have panned the narrators, and maybe with the first book they hadn't yet found their bearing either, but throughout the series they are outstanding in my opinion. I couldn't get enough of this story. I'm thankful that I came to it late, when there were already more than 10 books to enjoy. I admit that I have expected the author to wrap up this saga before now, but in reality I am thankful that he kept the characters and their world alive. I recommend this series with no reservations.,If you read several of the listener ratings you will find that half love it and half hate it.  This is not anything like LotR.  This is bigger in every respect.  The world is bigger, the characters are deeper and thjere are many, many, more of them.  If you take on this series you need to be ready to focus.  If you listen half heartedly you will be lost very quickly.  I understand some of the points of the bad reviews.  This series is detailed.  You will always know what everyone is wearing and what every room looks like and some people will find it tiresome.  I however really get a sense of being in the story and that is why I read/listen.  If your thing is a movie type book, a few hours and everything is rapped up, then you are looking for something else.  There are many great stand alone books on this site alone but if you are looking for a neck deep fantasy with as much intrigue as can be put on paper then look no further.  Personally this and the Sword of Truth are my favorites.  Be warned though that the author recently died and the 12th book (A Memory of Light) is now being written by Brandon Sanderson of Mistborn.  The final installment is about 60% through the rough draft phase.  I usually dont get books until the series is done because i cant stand waiting a year to see how it ends but just the fact that the last book is on its way has prompted me into a second go round on this series so I know exactly what is going on.  WHether you get this one or not happy listening.,I am overjoyed to find audible choose to carry this Unabridged series.  It is pretty much the only place anywhere you can find this extraordinary Unabridged audio series.  The abridged version of this series is horrible; however this version is a true and rare audio gem.  I have listened to literally a few hundred audio books in my life, most of which were either sci-fi/ fantasy and this series stands out as one of the best I?ve heard.  It has exquisite readers both Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are among the best audio readers I've ever heard.  As anyone who has heard audio can probably relate to, the quality of the reader is vital to the experience of the book and these are simple two of the best in the business.  They capture the characters perfectly and draw you in like few other readers can.  Another great and fairly unique thing this audio reading does is when the books comes from the perspective of a female character Kate gives you the female voice to match, where as if you are in the head of a male character Michael reads to give you that male feel.  This makes a big difference in the whole experience, how much the reading brings the character to life and draws you into their world.  Speaking of which, Robert Jordan's WOT world is one of the most vivid, complex and original world I have experienced in fantasy.  The world's complexity continues to grow throughout the huge epic series.  It makes you want to know what is going on in different lands almost as much as what is happening with different characters.  In the first half of this series each book is better then the one before as the main characters, the world and the adventure expands.  If you get a chance, please request that audible carry the rest of this Unabridged series.  As of now they carry book one (The Eye of the World) and two (The Great Hunt).  I guess that's about it.  Enjoy, I hope you have as much fun with it as I did.,There is very little in the way of accolades that I could add to what has already been written about this book except to second the praise for it. When choosing a book, I do consider how many people have taken the time to rate and review a book, as well as what the reviews have to say. Therefore, the value of this book to me requires that I say something to encourage others to take it as a selection. This was my first Robert Jordan book. It's about 30 hours long and I finished it in two and a half days. I could not put it down. It is a masterpiece in almost every aspect of the word and I do not know how the narration could possibly have been improved. I was blown away.,This intro may seem slow to some, but it really is a great beginning to an amazing adventure.  Not the best book in the series but it's one that will always be special to me simply because of the world that introduced me to.,,If you want to spend 6 months of commuting wishing that your drive was longer so that you could listen to more....  This is your series.,I read this series over a decade ago and waited anxiously for each new book to come out.  I wanted to enjoy the series again while I drove 45 mins to/from work.  It just didn't work for me.  The reader just read too slow for me.  And the use of two different readers who both read male and female parts - after the first reader had already read the female parts - didn't make sense to me.  If you're going to use various readers, why not have them be consistent in reading the same character throughout the book?   Very disappointed.,My kids and I love fantasy books and were excited about starting a long series that we had heard a lot about.  I'm not really sure where everyone gets that Michael Kramer is a great narrator unless they have stuck it out and listened to more books in this series.  Frankly, he starts out AWFUL.  We almost stopped listening just because of him.  His cadence is so predictable and completely got on my nerves for the first 2/3 of the book.  The first part that Kate Reading read seriously saved this book for us and we kept listening.,,... and then about 2/3 of the way through it get SO much better.  We are now almost finished with the 2nd book in the series and it is wonderful.  Yes, this book has a slow start.  But as you continue with the story you understand why - it NEEDS a slow start.  I'm rating it pretty high even though I never thought I would get through it.  Give it a chance and you will have a great start on an epic series.,I got this because I remember reading it many years ago. Unfortunately, the narrator makes this sound ridiculous with an exaggerated, dramatic tone.,Awesome!  One of the best series of books i've read/listened to and i've read quite a lot of fantasy & scifi.  It is a must read for anyone even mildly interested in fantasy adventure.,,Pleasssse...don't listen to the abridged volumes you will regret it.  Also please request to audible that they get the rest of the series in Unabridged versions.  I'm on my second reading and it's as good as the first.,,Rob 37yrs old,Cville, VA,Love Americans and the accent, but fantasy novels so quickly become cringe-worthy when narrated in an American accent. there's a reason why, when you watch The Lord of the Rings there's not an American twang in earshot. totally kills the immersion or any credibility/authenticity.,I have been listening through this series for a few months now and really enjoying it. I would have given 5 starts to it apart from some of the slightly repetitive statements. Then I got to book 8 and it is not available (the other 10 are), having contacted Audible they informed me that they have not yet got the license for it. I have to say that has put the dampers on my listening pleasure.,If you are thinking about starting this epic listening experience I would wait until it is available.,,,At approximately 457 hours this series of books are not for the faint hearted and there are a couple of things that I had an issue with.,,Firstly, Mr Jordan does like to describe what a character is thinking and in particular, what they are wearing. Heaven help you if there are 10 or more characters in any one scene as you will soon discover in turn what each person is wearing (down the buttons and trim), what facial expression they have, the length of their hair, what they are thinking and everything in-between. This becomes infuriating at times and on more than one occasion I found myself yelling at my phone ""Just get on with it!""  Honestly, if he had cut down these descriptions I reckon he could have cut the length of the books in half.,,Secondly, the vast majority of the female characters are quite unlikable. In the most part I would use the word horrible to describe them.  This is toned down a bit when Brandon Sanderson takes over at book 12.,,Lastly, the 2 narrators were unnecessary in my opinion.  Just a little thing but worth a mention.,,Now for the good.  Oh my, its epic!  Some of the pacing may be a little off in places but it is an excellent story.  The pay off is definitely in the last 3 books.  You will not be disappointed. No spoilers here but ‚ÄúThe last battle‚Äù makes the battle of Pelennor Fields or the Siege of Dros Delnoch look like a minor skirmish.,,In conclusion, if you have the time and can cope with the issues above (and you will know by the first couple of books) its well worth the listen.,,Knew within a couple of minutes that I was irritated by the narrator. By 30 minutes I was done. Have no idea if this is a good story. Returned.,While Jordan was American I am disappointed they used people with such heavy accents. It is okay but I would say when compared to Fry reading Harry Potter you will be hugely disappointed.,Remember, you're embarking on a 450-hour journey. I'll review it in its entirety. I finished the audiobook series a while ago, but apparently I never wrote a review.,,As you might know, the author died before he could finish the series. Brandon Sanderson used his notes to officially finish the series. For whatever reason, those last 3 books are the best in the series.,,It's a very good story, when looked at from the outside.,It's the only story I'll never recommend.,Book 10 (out of 14) is atrocious. I gave up on it and read the summary on Wikia. You should too when you realise that nothing is happening in that book. Your time is more valuable... unless you're in jail I suppose.,The last 3 books are excellent.,The story is too long for what it's worth.,,The main characters are immature.,The main characters get into a lot of trouble.,The world-building is extensive.,There is magic... a lot of magic.,There are thoroughly depicted and unique cultures.,There is a versatile, but not thoroughly prepared, magic system.,The author does not know how to exploit the potential of his own ideas, or he didn't care.,Many ideas are diamonds in the rough and I weep for their wasted potential.,Yet there are quite a few unique ideas.,Some of those ideas still cross my mind, one year later, after experiencing tons of other fantasy stories.,The idea to length ratio is still not high.,The story is too long.,,It's a plot-driven story.,There are some very epic scenes.,The plot warps the characters. If something epic needs to happen and the characters aren't where they should be, they'll start acting out of character until the pawns are all where the plot can have the greatest effect.,After a little practice, I could predict epic scenes with 100% reliability based on when characters stopped acting like themselves.,There aren't THAT many epic scenes, in the grand scheme of things.,The story is too long.,,The author filled the story with a lot of annoying characters.,Most of the female characters look down on men.,Most of the male characters look down on women.,Most of the female characters are incompetent, especially the young ones.,Some of the main characters bicker constantly.,Sometimes I felt that the author's best method of achieving realism was to describe it in real-time.,The story is too long.,,Most of the time I just wanted The Dark One to succeed because he was more relatable/mature than everyone else. Maybe that was the point? He is pretty old.,The book follows a pretty standard formula, stretched to its breaking point.,The story is too long.,,Individually, each book could be described as 5/5 if I were generous.,Only the final book offers any sense of closure.,A shocking plot point towards the end of the story poisoned the ending.,When the closure was offered, it didn't matter because of the aforementioned plot point.,None of the other books are worth reading on their own.,The story is too long.,,Despite my determination to complete a story I'd invested so much effort in, I often found myself pausing the audiobooks to do nothing. Doing nothing was less boring than a lot of the scenes. I'm glad I finished the series though because like I said, not finishing it would have been a waste of the time I'd already spent listening to it. It's called effort justification.,,Do not listen to it unless you have a good reason to believe you'll enjoy it.,I can't with a good conscience recommend somethig so massive to anyone.,The story is too long.,Fantastic book...loved the whole series when I read them......however I was very dissapointed with the audio version.....maybe just me, but the narrators voice makes me cringe.....very piercing and monotone......maybe just an Englishman not liking American accent so best to decide for youselves....listen first like I didn't.....,Epic fantasy at its best.  Delighted there are so many books in the series as this will solve the commuting boredom problem for many weeks yet!,Very much like Brandon Sanderson (or rather, Brandon Sanderson is very like Robert Jordan).  Reminds me of Sanderson's Stormlight book -  a very similar feel.,The narration is good - perhaps not the best I have ever heard, but it doesn't detract from the story at all.,Occasionally I would like the female characters to be slightly different from each other - they all seem to be cut from the same cloth, and therefore are a little predictable and perhaps a little boring, but the storyline itself is compelling, and you can't help but download the next book in the series immediately the current one finishes  (I am about to download number 5 - still happily enjoying it all).,,5 well deserved stars from me for this book - part one of the Wheel of Time series.,,After listening to the preview a few times I very nearly didn't bother to buy this book.  I thought the narrators voice would grate on my nerves and stop me from enjoying the book.,,I was attracted by the length of the story, thinking that over 29 hours of 'read' time would keep me occupied for quite some time. Also the number of books available in the series on Audible means I'll not be short of a book to read for quite some time!,,I was quickly absorbed by the story and forgot the narrators American accent, although it was a bit of a 'jolt' when a female narrator cut in part way through the book! (Although she only reads a few chapters here and there before the male narrator returns),The 29 hours passed too quickly and I'm eager to 'read' the second book in the series.,,The Eye Of The World reminds me of the Lord of the Rings in lots of ways, strange names, battles, good against evil, a quest, all well told, well described and very enjoyable.,,A very good read which I'll probably return to in the fullness of time.,,,,,Years I ago I read this book as a very young 13 year old. It was daunting then (the sheer size of it, and the sequels) and I gave up half-way through. It's still daunting now, but in a way that I relish - it's massive. This book alone is 29 hours long, and there's currently 13 sequels out with another one on it's way. If you're looking for a series to sink your adventuring teeth into then look no further.,,I was initially weary of the American narrator, and I doubted I could listen to his accent for 29 hours, let alone the sequels. However my fears disappeared within the first chapter - he does an excellent job, and I honestly forget about the accent altogether.,,I shan't dwell on the book itself, since its continued success and legacy stands testament to its quality. You'll find a plethora of reviews of the Amazon site proper, but my advice is to just dive into this book - it's superb.,Okay let's break it down:,Trolocs (idiotic name Btw) = trolls+orcs,Emensfield=Hobbiton,Half men=Ring raith,Ogire=Ent,The dark one (seriously? That the most creative thing you could come up with?)=Sauron,Morain=Gandalf,Lan=Aragorn,Matt=Golom,ect.,Basically get a shameless rip-off of tolkein, surround it with uninteresting characters, make the pacing choppy and you get Eye of the World. All of the female characters are either whiney or aloof. They introduce these very scary and incredibly dangerous legendary beings, only to kill them 5 minutes later. The Eye of the World isn't mentioned till like hour 18. The answer to all their problems is ""the wheel weaves as the wheel wills"". Rand is so uninteresting that he could have died a gruesome death in the middle and I wouldn'tve cared. During the finale, I was groaning out loud at how frustrating it was.,Bottom line. If you're looking for a good fantasy series and haven't read them yet: start with name of the wind or the way of kings. Don't understand the popularity of this one though. Altogther disappointing.,Would you say that listening to this book was time well-spent? Why or why not?,I couldn't get past chapter 4 as the narration was so over-exaggerated it detracted from what I know is a fantastic story. The accent didn't help either, although that's personal preference and all I could think of was that the narrator was speaking with the same strange emphasises as the character Zapp Brannigan.,Who might you have cast as narrator instead of Kate Reading and Michael Kramer ?,I honestly didn't get to a chapter read by Kate Reading so wouldn't be able to comment on her narration.,Really fantastic book to listen too. Amazing Readers. I love that Michael Kramer reads fpr all the chapters of male point of view and Kate Reading read for all chapters from female point of view. I believe it may shock some listeners due to kate not entering until mid book but I listen to the prequel A New Spring first whixh was primarly female point of view. overall a fantastic story with indepth characters. I loved it.,The Wheel of Time is an iconic and breathtaking series but It's so long that I was never able to finish reading it. I am really enjoying the audiobook because it's so easy to listen to. The narrators do great voices and have an excellent reading tone that is easy to listen to. Can't wait to listen to the next one!,I have read this book many times and it's interesting to hear the pronunciations of the names and places that differ from my own. a great read.,loved it a lot but having read the books first, I cringe whenever the narrators say 'saldea',Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?,If said friend was into fantasy, for sure! This one is a classic.,Any additional comments?,Whoever described the reader at Zapp Brannigan in their review is a genius. I couldn't stop laughing when I heard his voice! Don't let the reviews about the reader(s) being annoying put you off, just picture Zapp Brannigan.,it's my favourite fantasy series !  The story and the characters come to life ! The Narrator's are awesome.,Wasnt convinced in the first 5 hours of this audiobook, had to do a bit of rewinding to get my head around it.,around 10 hours in it reallt starts steaming along and Im very excited for book 2.,I missed so much little bit the first time I read this. I'm glad I went back for a second time"
The Dark Tower I,"Movie, TV & Video Game Tie-Ins,Supernatural,Suspense,Fantasy",Literature & Fiction,"Y IS A CROOKED LETTER AND CAN'T BE MADE STRAIGHT,This recording, which replaced the old recording is, I believe the same, old recording, only  with King's introduction taken out. An intro in which King  said he did not know where this series was going. For me that showed big time in the feel of the story. I enjoyed the first chapter which was, more of a novelette. After that, the story is told mostly in dreams and remembering. Even the first chapter is Roland telling his story to another man.,DO SOME MEN EVER GROW UP OR ONLY COME OF AGE?,This series has a huge following, but it is more for those who like descriptive language, dreamy wild scenes, but no plot. If horror was a main subject and not a sub of fiction, this would be under Weird Western. Joe R. Lansdale and Jack Ketchum write in that genre a lot. This story was just a little too abstract for my taste.,LONG DAYS, PLEASANT NIGHTS,Guidall is the father of narrators and one of the best still. He makes the story better.,,No Spoiler: This book was better than I imagined it would be. Of course, you will find some disturbing images, but overall, it was less vulgar and better paced than I expected a King novel to be. As usual, he introduces characters, but takes his sweet time to develop them. I had tried to read this before but was bored with it until I saw the movie trailer and that prompted me to give it another try and having the knowledge it involved sci-fi items and having faces with the characters really helped me enjoy this. The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. I understand now that this was a series of short stories in the beginning and I see why it was that way, but I wasn't prepared for no closure or answers at the end. The narration was really well done and I listened at 1.5X speed to save some time. If any of this was helpful, please click YES below. Later.,What disappointed you about The Gunslinger?,This book was one of the most boring things I have ever experienced. I toughed it out because everyone said how great the series is. I almost quit several times because it was so slow. I did enjoy book 2 more than this one, so I'm glad I got through this. It was rough.,This is the first book of Stephen King's Magnum Opus. It is a combination of spaghetti western, occult, and science fiction all tied together by romantic and  philosophical ideals.,It is very short and gets very dark at certain points: this paired with the wonderful narration of George Guidall is why I believe all should give it a listen.,At no point of the story I felt that I cared too much for the protagonist. I felt that the novellas with backstory were meant to tell me something, but the whole point was lost on me.,just too difficult to follow the storyline. Perhaps I will get the next book to see if I can catch on.  Performance was excellent.,Loved this book decades ago and it still holds up. Can't wait for the movie version!,All I know is there is a guy and another guy and some stuff happened. Least entertaining book I've listened to ever.,This is the worst book I have ever heard. Boring and stupid. I can't believe I bought it.,Was not able to get hooked on this book, and couldn't see myself reading the rest of series"
Things We Left Behind,,,"everybody reacts to this book. I thought it was the worst book that I‚Äôve heard on audible after three or four years.  The male lead was so obnoxious, domineering, and rude that I couldn‚Äôt see anybody liking him. Since the female lead, has always loved him in spite of their arguing and insulting each other, she deserves him.,The female narrator was very good as a female, but extremely irritating as the male. Sebastian York is one of my favorite male narrators but even he couldn‚Äôt save this.,I‚Äôm not a prude, but there was so much foul language and graphic sex talk that I really couldn‚Äôt stomach it. The only reason that I listened to the entire book, was that I don‚Äôt like quoting things once I‚Äôve started them.  It was way too long and way too offensive for me to give it more than one star.,I almost stopped the story after race and LGBTQ were just randomly thrown in. Does every book have to throw there opinion on their political views. It had nothing to do with the story.,Too much soft porn, not enough story.  Quit halfway through.  Very disappointing, do not recommend.,This book was way too woke and juvenile. The performance was good, but it was like listening to a couple of immature teenagers.,My heart‚ù§Ô∏è I won't spoil anything...but I hope this is not the end of knockemout series....maybe mini novelas with side characters......I loved loved this book!,Cried about the loss of her dad,And the childhood Lucias had.,A little back and fourth 23 years ago as neighbor kids and his families abuse,To now. Where they didn‚Äôt like each other,One night hook up lead to them falling in love,He pushed her away in order to protect her,Slow slow star to the good stuff,Good Sex and spice,Funny banter,Sloan is a bit annoying lol,But Lucian‚Äôs is hot,Friends to enemies to lovers,Family, great friend group, long epilogue,Loved this series! I truly love everything this author writes! She is able to tastefully include aspects of alternative lifestyles while keeping your interest and teaching a bit of acceptance along the way. The main characters where perfect and perfectly flawed at the same time. The narrators were absolutely perfect. Sebastian York‚Äôs is dreamy.  I search for every book he narrates! The way he delivers humor is so effortless. Lila Winters makes the characters so real you feel like the characters are friends. So worth the purchase!!!,I‚Äôve read the entire series. Each book gets progressively more woke, which is annoying. But my least favorite part is the stories‚Äô conclusion that you know you‚Äôve found the love of your life when they let you put a finger in their butt. Heavy eye roll.,This is so bad, I stopped listening after a couple of hours. The writing is unprofessional like it was written by a kid. Hope to return it!!,I admit that after listening to this (I started it immediately on release day) I have taken quite some time to write a review because I don't enjoy giving lower ratings. But then again, maybe someone else will benefit from my thoughts, so here goes...,I was sooo looking forward to Lucian's book and pre-ordered this as soon as it was available. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations and left me quite disappointed.,For the narration part of this book:,Sebastian York and Lila Winters did as good a  job as possible BUT I do think that the author should have gone with another male narrator. Yes, I listened to the previous 2 books in this series and although it didn't make much difference that Mr York narrated both Knox & Nash's books (with book 1 - Knox - been by far the best in the series), I feel it would have made a bigger impact using someone else for Lucian.  [That being said, Sebastian York still remains one of my favorite narrators. üòÅ],The book/story itself:,As I said previously, it did not live up to my expectations. The book dragged on and there was too much emphasis put on the characters in the previous books, making it waaaay longer than necessary. I can honestly say that there are entire chapters in this book that could have been removed completely.,As for the 2 main characters - Sloane (heroine) came across too meek and not as she was portrayed in the previous books. Understandably the loss of Sloane's father added to her frame of mind, but there's more to it than that.,So too with the hero (Lucian) - he wasn't as cutthr0at as what I'd imagined and *sigh* that was a total letdown.,So all in all, I cannot in good conscience give THE THINGS WE LEFT BEHIND a higher rating than an average of 3 stars.,Can be read as a standalone with a HEA. Dual pov.,,As most romances there are a few tiny cringey parts, HOWEVER, the cute levels were off the charts with these two the backstory, the spice, the shear drama of the whole book meant i couldn‚Äôt put it down cuz things kept happening! Loved every part of it,,I read the other 2 so had to read this one, it was actually the better of the 3 story wise but the same cringy immature  dialogue, repeated phrases (sucking in a breath) a lot of he said, she said in the dialogue which wasn't necessary, the same immature character behaviour,it's frustrating as the story and plots and research for the plots is good, it's just the ott love fest, ott angst, ott possessiveness,,I liked the characters and the story but I cringed a lot and rolled my eyes,the epilogue was a bit ott as well and timeline was hard to invisage,over all a very sickly sweet, story with over the top angst and drama,,Great book. Easy sun lounger read. Very much chic lit and although predictable, still enjoyable. Read the first 40 chapters myself and listened to the audiobook for the final few chapters. The voices put me off and the impersonations they did when quoting other characters were very off putting.,,This did not disappoint. I read a couple of negative reviews prior to tackling this book, however it was good. I listened and read this book, I‚Äôve not done this before. The silky tones of Sebastian York are always a pull, and Lila did a great job too.,Thank you Lucy Score, I will be listening to and reading more of you.,Well deserved 5üåüs,This whole series has been fabulous, but Sloane and Lucian‚Äôs book is my favourite. I devoured this in two days - wonderful narration and a beautiful story that had me laughing and crying. And the epilogue was EVERYTHING! I don‚Äôt want this series to end -  thank you Lucy Score for a joyful (and sexy!) read!,best in the series, a steamy gripper, had me hooked from the start. Well done Lucy Score, another winner,Completely lost now I‚Äôve finished this series. Was my all time favourite! I don‚Äôt want it to end. Absolutely adore all of the characters,Captivated from the start, such a perfect ending to the series, didn‚Äôt want it to end!,or should I say Didn't want this series to end!,I WANT MORE! I WANT MORE!,For anyone reading this review,  if you have not yet read any of the 3 books in this series, do yourself a MASSIVE favour and do so ASAP!,Take your time and absorb them all!,There is nothing to not like about these books.,THANK YOU! THANK YOU, Lucy Score for share these stories with us.,All the Narrators are also excellent! üíï,As you would expect, the story of Sloane and Lucian, which we've all been waiting for, is a true and fitting end to the Knockemout saga.,I'd love a fuller story for Stef and Jeremiah and Maeve and her man but we can't get what we want all the time!,You won't be prepared for how easily Lucifer steals your heart right along side Sloane's!,so much more spice in this book if you're looking for something a little dirty. I loved every moment. perfect performance from both the readers üëå,Easy listening, relaxing. You don‚Äôt have to think. Predictable chick literature!,First time Lucy Score reader,This was a perfect conclusion to the series, i loved all three but I think the build up for this story was just too good. I would have to say that this was my favourite of the series.,Found this was the weakest of three, so dissapointed. Plot didn't grab me, nor the leads - fast forwarded large chunks. so maybe it was just tge editing. I am writing this a week after finishing, and can barely recall any of it. Whil I usually like the female narrator, felts did a poor job on thus one. She just sounded petulant all the time, undermining portrayal of smart mature woman, and her tone/cadence for male dialogue in continued petulant tone really didn't work. male narrator did well. wish they female narrator listened to male, to try to at least match his delivery, rather than sounding like a wholeness character that is 10 years younger.,I loved this so hard! The narration was perfect and the story the perfect finish to the series,I wasn't sure how much I'd like this one as I enjoyed the first two quite a lot. I won't say it was my favourite of the series but it definitely held its own and was entertaining!,What a great story. And thank you Lila Winters and Sebastian York for bringing this (and the whole series) to life.,I couldn't wait for this one. Lucians and Sloanes' story did not disappoint. So much angsty angst built from the first two books. Honestly, I loved this as much as the first book. Excellent conclusion to this series üëè,Loved this entire series.,Always surprising.,Was not disappointed.,Hilariously, sexy and mysterious.,Lucy Score for the win!!,Wow, just loved this book. It was my favourite from the series. The characters are depicted so well. I really felt like I knew Sloane and Lucien so well by the end.,This book has everything you could want, drama, sex, romance, suspense, crime. It was so good!"

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,"Action & Adventure,Dystopian",Teen & Young Adult,"Good story and interesting premise BUT the reader is not interested,he sounds bored.,I would have prefered Tatiana (original book reader) to Fontana.,Suzanne Collins, the award-winning and best-selling author of The Hunger Games Saga, invites the readers and listeners back to this beloved series with the recently released The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.,,With its action set 64 years before the exhilarating events in The Hunger Games, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a prequel, an origin story for one of the most hateful characters in this extremely appreciated works of fiction. Coriolanus Snow is a young man down on his luck, his family fortunes are gone and he is chosen to be a Mentor for one of the kids destined to fight to the death in The Hunger Games.,,Fans of this series will discover how the games were in their inception, how The Capital looked 10 years after the war and most importantly, how this renowned character, hated and despised in the original stories, started his path to power.,,After his excellent performance for Stephen King's The Institute, actor, singer and narrator Santino Fontana does a great job in bringing to life the events, characters and locations in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.I  enjoyed Santino Fontana's delivery of this work and I am always glad to listen to him.,,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a great opportunity for fans of The Hunger Games to step back into this world filled with violence, action, horrors, betrayal, dirty politics, dark secrets and unforgettable characters. Although I am not a Hunger Games fan, I think I'll pick up the series as soon as I'll get some free time as I am ''hungry'' to relive the events set after this prequel.,,If you liked this review please vote Helpful below and find more of them here and on theAudiobookBlog.,I also post honest reviews at the author, narrator or publisher's request, you can get in touch with me for more details.,,Thank you & stay safe,,Victor,Like others have said, this reader is awful.,He sounds like he is reading a mundane ""same stuff, different day"" news story.,Not much inflection. Pauses in the wrong places.,Almost as if he is reading a list.,No change of tone when changing to a flash back.,Character voices are barely changed.,When excitement happens at the reaping it brings about a yawn. :(,I'm breaking my rule of always finishing a work before writing a review because I can't believe the reviews saying that Santino Fontana doesn't provide a good performance here. Fontana gives a measured narration that fits a third-person limited perspective. Since there is no ""narrator"" character in this work, (unlike the originals, where the narrator is Katniss), it wouldn't make sense for Fontana to go over the top with emotion during the narration. In fact, I would argue that it would be distracting for him to do so. He still provides proper inflection during narration and dialogue.,,UPDATE: I've finished the book and am really impressed with this story. It's darker and bleaker than the original trilogy, but it's still incredibly compelling. The narrative goes to a few unexpected places and the way Suzanne Collins fleshes out Snow, adding real dimension without trying to redeem him from irredeemable actions, is an incredible feat.,I‚Äôm a big fan of Santino Fontana so I‚Äôm probably biased but I enjoy his narration. He does different voices for different characters. And he might be dry at times but I think it fits the character (or at least how far I‚Äôve gotten). I honestly wasn‚Äôt going to bother listening to this until I saw he was the narrator. As for the story itself it‚Äôs such a weird choice for a prequel.  Never while reading the Hunger Games trilogy was I like ‚Äúoh Snow is so interesting I must know more about him‚Äù,While the story is, as expected, good, the narrator is pretty disappointing. Up the speed to 1.1- it helps.,Just started, but so disappointed in the narration so far! ugh I was so invested in the previous narrator that it's a difficult adjustment. We'll  see how it goes..,Rating: 5.0/10,,As you can probably tell, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was a much anticipated prequel novel of mine as I loved The Hunger Games novels. Obviously having listened to it in less than a full day, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be over the moon about it. It has to be such a joy entering Panem once again after such a long period away.,,Well‚Ä¶ I was really underwhelmed and I‚Äôm sort of gutted by it.,,What I was expecting to be a deep-dive character study into Snow and how he became the most hated man in YA fiction for several years came to fruition, for the most part. Though the book picks up at the ripe age of 18, and no flashbacks of his earlier years are really mentioned, it is easy to to figure out that Snow has always been this vile, self-centered individual who only does things to benefit himself and no-one else. There are glimpses of humanity in those eyes, but they are blurry and overshadowed by blatant narcissism.,,Snow is mentoring tribute Lucy Gray of District 12 in the 10th annual Hunger Games, and her character stands out almost immediately. Snarky and oft-times bull-headed, she jumps off the page early on and becomes a bright spot on the gritty, blood-stained games. Unfortunately, she is overshadowed by Snow‚Äôs infatuation and search for control/possession of her that her character tends to take a backseat.,,Those looking for another ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù are going to be, IMO, a little disappointed. This isn‚Äôt that type of novel. It is a character study that happens to have a competition going on in its midst. The game isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúput together‚Äù as the original trilogies were; it is almost like the game is being beta tested to see how it can be improved. Tributes can easily hide from one another (and the cameras), the battleground is still stained with blood from past competitions, gifts from ‚Äúfans‚Äù aren‚Äôt as readily available, but let me tell you, the gruesomeness of children killing one another hasn‚Äôt gone away. Collins also throws in the good ole references to keep fans of the original trilogy happy.,,I also have to say that Santino Fontana did a fantastic job with what he was given. I‚Äôve seen so many scathing reviews at his performance, but the guy is a phenomenal talent. Funny enough, I listened to his narration of the ‚ÄúYou‚Äù novels by Caroline Kepnes earlier this year and this novel felt like a YA version of that series at points. Curious if he was chosen because of that‚Ä¶ did I stumble upon something?,,Seriously peeps, I am only offering my opinion. Collins can write, no doubt about it, but this one just wasn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm not going to go off the deep end and say it was a cash grab, but I will say that I can imagine there will be several readers feeling the same way I do: maybe this is why Rowling never wrote a prequel about Voldemort.,This story has so much potential, but the same way you can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet, this monotone, lackadaisical narration is extremely difficult to overcome. I devoured The Hunger Games trilogy in both print and audio form. That enjoyment led me to preorder this prequel.,,The previous narrator (Maslany) brought the story to life, as a good narrator should. This one, however, has me strongly considering a return. I‚Äôll get the book in print, I suppose. Something tells me, though, that they should consider having this title re-recorded. It‚Äôs not about first-person versus third-person, or Snow being more cold and calculating. Sometimes a narrator just isn‚Äôt a good fit, or just isn‚Äôt feeling the story. I felt the same way about Dawson‚Äôs read of Artemis.,,Also, as an aside, there is a ton of inconsistency in the audio production itself. Lots of unintentional changes in tone and volume, lots of clearly re-recorded lines. Punching in properly should help the narrator match tone. That clearly didn‚Äôt happen here. Seems like it was recorded, mixed, and mastered by an amateur. Perhaps a byproduct of the pandemic?,,Update: I normally listen at higher speeds anyway, but I've taken the advice of some and upped my listening rate even further to 1.7X. This has definitely improved the experience.,,Update 2: Sorry, I really tried. As a fan, I gave it my all. I just can‚Äôt listen to this narrator at any speed. Definitely one of the worst I‚Äôve encountered for such an anticipated title. My apologies, but I have to return this book.,THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES:  This prequel is about the life of the future President Snow when he was 18 year old  Coriolanus Snow and the 10th annual Hunger Games occurred.  Suzanne Collins' creativity and excellent writing along with the outstanding narration by actor Santino Fontana make this a must listen for those who have read or listened to the three prior Hunger Games novels.,,Edit:  I mentioned that this prequel novel includes the 10th annual Hunger Games.  The original Hunger Games novel took place at the 74th annual Hunger games which Katniss Everdeen won.  That would mean that President Snow was than 82 years old.  So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a prequel by 64 years.,,The Hunger Games series is written for teens.  I last saw my teen years almost 60 years ago, but the series certainly appeals to me.,,Edit 2:  Several of the Audible reviewers of this novel have been very critical of the narration of actor Santino Fointana.  I have no idea where they are coming from.  From my perspective Fontana's narration is perfect (it could not have been better).,I‚Äôve seen reviews on audible UK and US which say how terrible the narrator is. Honestly, I think audible have slowed it down because on 1x speed it is very slow and monotonous, and does not sound natural. I am listening at 1.4x speed and it sounds SO much better! He‚Äôs not monotonous at all and at this speed, it sounds like natural speech. I‚Äôd say 1.3/1.4 are the best speeds to listen at to get the most out of the narrator‚Äôs expressions and differing voices. Please don‚Äôt write this book off because of the narration reviews!! I am thoroughly enjoying it!,,Edited to add: I‚Äôve just finished it and had to come back and add to my review that I really enjoyed this book. It gives us Snow‚Äôs history perfectly and shows us exactly why he hates Katniss so much. Brilliantly done. One minute, you‚Äôre rooting for Snow, the next you want him to fail. Loved it!,Book aside, the production of this audiobook has some serious problems.,For such a highly anticipated book, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have edited probably and someone would have done a listen through for mistakes before publication.,The audio changes pitch and volume constantly. It is very clear where recording was stopped for one day and picked up the next. I like the narrator, but for an established stage actor, you‚Äôd think he would check is vocals.,At one point the book starts repeating itself. Half a page is read and the repeated, this happens a few times.,Really disappointed in the production.,If they re-record or even just clean up the version they have, i think it will do the book more justice.,At the moment you lose the story to the bad audio. Both author and narrator deserve better.,Please fix it!,I cannot listen to this the way it is.  Please please can you change the narrator.  The whole thing is ruined, I can't get past first chapter.  Thank you - I will wait....,I found it hard to listen to the narrator doing female voices and speaking songs.,Not a fan of the narrator of this book. But other than that the story is great,Firstly the guy that reads this is a bit bad at it. For all the singing you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd find someone a little less annoying to read it all. However I like that he sounds stuck up because it‚Äôs sounds very capitol like.,Then we get to the story.,It‚Äôs very confusing. A lot of boring parts too. I think the purpose of this was to explain some of the origins a bit better but it would have been better to focus on the rise of snow. I‚Äôm a bit annoyed that I want to root for him and see his humanity in this. I thought he was meant to be the bad guy.,There are a lot of good explanations for things and these can interest the reader. Some parts of the story are interesting but it takes a long while to see action and it‚Äôs pretty short lived. Back to confusion and a slow pace. Lucy isn‚Äôt someone I really care about further than not wanting her to lose the games.,Despite all my complaints so far it‚Äôs a good book. I‚Äôm into part 2 now and have liked it if not exactly loved it. It‚Äôs not as good as the first trilogy but it‚Äôs an ok book and I hope the writer takes whatever criticism she may get on board and improves for whatever she plans to do next. However I hope she‚Äôs also not bullied into doing a basic cash grab book as some fans seem to want this without thinking of how boring that could really be. Maybe she‚Äôll never do anything with this story again. I‚Äôd be sad if that were the case but I hope she still improves for whatever book she does do no matter what.,They chose the wrong narrator. That droning voice ruined an already bloated story. Speaking the songs in such a robotic voice was awful. ""La la la, la la, la, la la la"" was the last straw.,The main issue with this audio book was the narrator. He was bland and didn‚Äôt convey much emotion in my opinion. Also, the songs could have been sung or at least said in a more sing song way instead read as a poem.,Book was really good! I roughly enjoyed getting to read the story from Snows perspective. It was weird to feel empathy for him at points, only to wind up loathing him at the end. If that's what the author intended, bravo, you did a good job!,Only a couple of points stopped me giving the story 5 stars. I really liked the nod of Snow hating the mocking Jay's and how that related to the hunger games... Except what started as a nod became a truck to the face as we were rammed with the reference over and over again. Only after the second hanging did his hate make sense, before that it felt misplaced and forced.,Some sections felt long and drawn out and others really quick. Like the ending flashes by in 30 mins yet there were plenty of scenes that didn't seem to have a whole lot happening that were dragged out.,I loved learning about where the hunger games started, but would have loved it more for the reasoning behind why they choose to give the winners big houses and loads of food when it felt like the capital themselves were barely making it.,Now onto the voice. Sanitino was brilliant at reading, his voice I could listen too for days and I adore the way he puts voices on for characters. But I feel a woman would have been better reading this. There were too many scenes of young girls singing and him awkwardly speaking the lyrics was jarring and pulled me from the story while I cringed. I found myself skipping songs as a result. Someone willing to sing them and do the singing of young girls better probably would have worked for this.,There were points too where it was clear the audio had been rerecorded. I get this was probably done in lockdown, but the sudden downgrade in quality of the audio only pulled me from the story again at points. For these reasons I'm giving it 3 stars.,the reader had very little expression in his voice . It made the story boring to listen to,I finished it solely for the reason that I like Hunger Games but ended up feeling it was a complete waste of time because there wasn't any part of the book that makes me feel like it's so good, I absolutely love this one. Without any spoilers, I would just say the book is filled with ""Oh, okay, is that it?"" moments that never evolved into something that make one's heart sings.,This book, was okay. I am fresh off a reread of the original trilogy, so I caught all the references to the world and lamb stew and Tigress and the Lake.,My main gripe with the audiobook is the songs, why aren't they performed as songs?? Would have made them so much better!,There were a few too many songs, could have edited a few of those out.,probably a lovely person in real life but horrible choice for a long anticipated book in my opinion.,however the story itself was fine perhaps a little dull but still a good addition to the series.,Absolute killer! In the best way. This book was so epic I want to curse before every second word. The Narrator is amazing! 5 stars all around, what an awesome experience! Had me rooting for Snow, annoyed, understanding and hating him. Thank you! I hope there will be more.,Loved it,  met my expectations. Hopefully there will be a second book. i would highly recommend this book to Hunger Games fans. Narrator was fine the voice he put on for Lucy was a bit of putting bit done well.,I had high hopes. I love the 3 Hunger Games books. I‚Äôve read them several times so when this was available for pre-order I grabbed it.,,It‚Äôs so incredibly boring. I‚Äôve had to force myself to push through but it continues to be one of the most bat sh*t boring stories I‚Äôve had the displeasure to hear on Audible.,,What‚Äôs with all the bloody songs? I can only assume the author is hoping this will one be picked up as depressing broadway musical.,,Very disappointed.,Good listening. A lot more brutal than the other books. A lot more raw feellings from the war. Disappointed with some character development, however not surprising overall.,Two-dimensional characters, including the main character Snow, written without nuance. The symbolism littered throughout the book was clumsy and obvious, and the story itself was plodding and indelicate.,Loved this book so much it means everything and adds so much to the already amazing world of the hunger games I can‚Äôt wait for the movie,What you know about the Hunger Games gets an origin story unlike any you could expect.,A twist or two, some emotional beats which land with full effect, characters so flawed and endearing you root for them despite it all. Amazing to think that you can actually find yourself championing for such an evil in an already broken world."
Silver Magi Omnibus Books 1-4,"Action & Adventure,Anthologies & Short Stories,Epic,Urban",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"im a fan of the author but this series was just pitiful.  the only likable part of any of these  stories was max the dog,Where is the rest of it?

Mother-Daughter Murder Night,"Women's Fiction,Amateur Sleuths,Cozy,Women Sleuths",Literature & Fiction,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews, but a few chapters in, and I‚Äôm done. The writing is meh, the narrator sounds like she‚Äôs reading a children‚Äôs book, and so far all of the characters, from the three main to the police, do implausible things meant to elicit clich√© reactions in the reader. I already know what to expect for the rest of the book, so no, thank you.,,It is fun, and engaging. I am not usually one to give 5 star reviews but i wanted to counteract the 1 star review that, to be honest, seemed in bad faith.,,I‚Äôve been looking for a light hearted fun mystery and this story fits the bill. I liked the narration and liked that the story is set in coastal Northern California. Santa Cruz is my happy place.,Not impressed, would not recommend this title to others. Fell quite short in many ways .,Great listen! It was a nice  surprise as I have never read/listened to this author.  The performance was excellent!,Great story. Kept me interested throughout the book. Looking forward to reading another from this author. Highly recommend,A comfortable mystery that kept me guessing until the end! Had just enough suspense to make me listen all the way through. Was family-centered, clean, and enjoyable to listen to!,Loved the whole story line. I would recommend this book to everyone. My book club will be discussing Mother-Daughter Murder Night. Love it.,I enjoyed listening to this audio book. I especially liked the relationships between the characters, mother-daughter-granddaughter. It is reminiscent of Gilmore Girls. The author gives them all a strong voice and varies the chapters by telling the story from each of their points of view. She does it well, and with the excellent reader's help, it's easy to distinguish who is the main focus in each scene. I liked how the story developed with the mystery and intrigue. I'll look for more books by this author, and more audios read by narrator Jane Oppenheimer.,Really enjoyed this one.  It definitely kept me guessing and wanting to see what was next!!,No wonder this is listed in Reece Witherspoon's book club and the New York Times best seller list.  It's really well written for a amatuer sloth murder mystery, The plot is not rocket science but it doesn't need to be as you get drawn into the relationships of 3 generations of women coming back together again.  Beautifully narrated by Jane Oppenheimer who really brought this book to life.,A big FIVE stars going out to the Author & Narrator on this one.,The story itself was good and the author painted a clear picture of the scene and characters, but I just was not invested in the story, we knew it wasn‚Äôt Jack so I wasn‚Äôt really bothered who did it as I didn‚Äôt know enough about any of the suspects so I just didn‚Äôt care. I was really close to not finishing but  pressed on with it,,Unnecessarily long and drawn out causing me to  lose attention and interest. It could have told the same story in a more succinct way.,I picked this because I‚Äôm a big fan of Simon‚Äôs non-fiction work about museums. Yeah it‚Äôs a nerd thing but happily the novel was very enjoyable in its own right. I love the family matriarch and the plot had enough red herrings to keep you guessing so I‚Äôm happy all round!,I really enjoyed this story, it was a nice twist on a typical murder plot line. The characters are great and plot progressed nicely which kept me wanting to get to the next chapter.,More focused on the three generations than the mystery which slowed things up at times but still something I kept returning to.,I loved this. Easy listening, but still really engaging.,An interesting dynamic around 3 generations of women, and a crime that truly brings them together. I'd recommend it for something a little more light-hearted compared to the typical whodunits.,Such a boring read. It felt like a thriller for pre teens. There was no good reason for the main character to want to solve the ""mystery"". Kept listening hoping for a twist and never got it.,Struggled to finish and gave up. Possibly before the good bits but I just couldn't get absorbed in it.,Frustrated by a slow story and a host of characters I just can‚Äôt seem to care about."
The Dragon Reborn,"Action & Adventure,Epic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"The Dragon Reborn is captivating from beginning to end! Robert Jordan does a wonderful job bringing many elements together at the end of this novel, and producing a very climatic ending. Though some might argue otherwise, the plot is moderately convoluted and will keep most readers riveted until the last page. It is well worth the listening!,Tai'shar Manetheren!,I feel 4 stars is being generous but overall the series is improving a lot. I have never been frustrated by a series characters more so than the ones in the WoT & it does feel like a struggle at times but I very much like the premise of the story & as I stated every book is improving. I'm going to continue with hopes that the character development improves also.,Kate Reading and Michael Kramer have achieved a feat of extraordinary ability. They have managed deliver a reading of the book with no sound effects or music that is both engaging and entertaining.,,Well worth your time,Would you listen to The Dragon Reborn again? Why?,No, it's extremely long and there are still a lot of books left in the series to finish.,What did you like best about this story?,The climax at the end, and the way Mat finally became a whole character.,Have you listened to any of Kate Reading and Michael Kramer ‚Äôs other performances before? How does this one compare?,Yes.  They are my two favorite narators.  I hear so many people talking about Michael Kramer in a negative way and I don't understand why.  He has so many different voices for all the characters.  He pauses in the correct places and his voice inflections are perfectly timed.  My only knock on both of them is that they read a little slower than I do, but that is no big deal at all.  I think they both have a good idea of what Robert Jordan intended his books to be percieved as.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,NO WAY!!  This book is LOOONNGG.,Any additional comments?,This book is hard to rate because overall it is a fantastic story with deep characters.  The world is alive with politics, good, evil, and everything in between.  It has another fantastic climatic ending that really starts to get rolling from 2/3 of the book on.  I do have 2 gripes about this series as a whole.  First is the fact that a rediculous amount of time is spent talking about stuff in past books and explaining them for someone that might not have read the previous ones.  This becomes really annoying.  My second gripe is the ""in between"" stuff.  You could read 30 pages in this book and not have a single thing happen.  This is however what makes the world so intricate, and the characters so deep.  Would I trade it for a shorter version?  Probably, but I'll take it like it is for now and move on to the next book with the same excitement that got me this far.,I found this book the slowest of the series so far, but still enjoyed it and will buy the next one in the series. Great series, love it. I'm also getting used to the switching between the two narrators who are both brilliant.,great story, great reading, what a pleasure. i'm hooked! Once you start you can't stop reading these adventures.,I definately agree with everyone who said slow...The book doesn't even start in the first half which is surprising considering this is one of the shorter stories in the series.  The second half definately got better but that even took a while.  The ending was once again superb however.  I got goosebumps at the end but the build up to it could have been shortened without loosing much.  Great book for anyone with a little patience but if you are looking for action from start to finish (like the first two books) go ahead and pass.,Alittle slow to start, but soon you will be full engrossed. I could not wait to here more,I really like the way Jordan plays off the reluctant hero.  His insights into men and women's views of the opposite sex are often funny and help relieve the seriousness of the story, which is, as always, incredibly original and well written.,,I read and enjoyed the first 2 books of the series and was looking forward to reading them all.  After this one, I am stopping.  This book could not have been any slower.  It was like listening to a 100 year old man tell a story, going off on countless tangents that serve no purpose to the main story.   Every time they enter a town do we really need to know what colour their shoes, socks, hats, and undergarments are?  Dow we really care what kind of exports they have and why their fishery dried up 80 years ago?  I kept waiting for these pointless observations to have meaning later and they did not.  This story was 4 hours of average content surrounded by over 20 hours of filler.  Very disappointing.,This is one of the best fantasy epics ever written, a series right up there with the work of J. R. R. Tolkien but be warned it is not one to be taken up lightly, this series is Huge!,The books have been kept together so one audio book will get you one book and many hours of happy listening.,Sadly Robert Jordan died in 2007 after publishing book 11, but with the help of Jordan‚Äôs wife/editor Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson has taken up the torch, using Jordan‚Äôs plentiful notes he is finishing off the series brilliantly, with book 14 being the final volume.,The series is voiced by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading throughout and their performances are exemplary, their narration brings the world to life in a way that simply reading it never had for me, they bring a unique voice and feeling to each of the characters that brings them to life and firmly embeds them in your heart.,The only negative I have to put in is that the audiobooks chapter division bears no relation to where the chapters start and end in the books making the chapter search and snooze modes on the app all but useless.,All in all a five star read. An absolute must for any fantasy epic fan.,,This is the shortest of the volumes so far, but has a very fast pace, unlike some of the later books. It is a journey, and building upon existing characters, while beginning to introduce a few more side characters, including Aes Sedai, and some new major characters too. Culminating in one of the best battles in the series (until Book 11 - Knife of Dreams, chapter 18), as the Dragon tries to seize the Stone of Tear, and we are introduced to the People of the Dragon - the awesome Aiel from the baked, arid wastes beyond the Dragon Wall. The battle of wills and of the one power shakes the STone to it's core as the Dragon attempts to put Forsaken in their places - well until the mistress of the night intervenes... well, you have to listen to find out now, don't you! Best series ever!!,The epic storytelling abilities shown in The Wheel of Time really come apparent in the third novel. The focus leaves the protagonist for much of the book which allows the audience to have a more in depth view of others in the steadily growing band of characters, namely the development of Perrin. Narrators excel as always.,I have read pretty much every major fantasy novel and so reckon I can give a fair judgement. So far, I am enjoying the Wheel of Time saga more than any other fantasy I have ever read.,,Don't waste your time with sword of truth saga - its just a copy of wheel of time apart from not as good.,,I would recommend this saga to anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, golden compass, sword of truth etc. Once you get to know the characters in this saga they are more lovable than all of the above mentioned.,,,,Another amazing sequel in this fascinating series. Can't wait to read the next book,,Another great entry into the series but I just can‚Äôt get along with the male narrators voice, it‚Äôs really forced and grates to the point this will be the last purchase of the series for me unfortunately. I‚Äôll stick to reading the books.,,The performance by both narrators is wonderful. They really have mastered narrating a wonderfully crafted tale so well. this is pure art. I am in awe at this world that Robert Jordan has created and given how lengthy the series is, I feel lucky to be able to experience it for a lot longer still.,I love this series of books, full of interweaving threads that always come back together again for the finally.,With the ending of book 2 I expected this book to be a bit more fast paced and more battles but I am not complaining. The story and world building was excellent and I am now rushing this review to start book 4.,You won't be disappointed!,This book is amazing. I love the series. The narrators have very calm and relaxing voices.,Loved this book the most out of the first three! Bring on the next one!,Loved it! Great narration, hooked to the end!,Great series of books, whole new experience in audiobook!,An amazing continuing story. The performance is unreal. Kate and Michael give the books life,I'm rereading this series that I first read in my early 20s. 30 years on the books are a little tired but still good fun. Theyre very obviously written by an old white man - definitely a 50s view of social mor√®s.,women are often portrayed as devious while men are sort of bumbling but well meaning - or strong and silent.,In terms of story and momentum though, its still a good read and I will be continuing with the series.,The male narrator is annoying to start with but after a while you dont notice his idiosyncratic delivery so much,For the first couple books, Matt was one of my least favourite characters. But through this one I have gained a newfound respect for the man and even come to like him more than many other characters. I also ship Perrin and Dark hard. Hoping they grow even closer in the next book.,Ran is whatever. He is barely in this book, and it is cool that he is the dragon reborn and he usually steps it up for some of his scenes, but he is my least favourite person amongst the three taveeran we are following. I still pike him, but Perrin and Matt seem like deeper characters to me at this point. I liked book one Ran and hope we see more character development from him beyond being in denial about being Lues Taerin reborn.,I Love these books! The BEST epic novels to have ever been written! Readers won't be disappointed!,Out of the three in the series this was the hardest one to get in to. There was a lot of building until the final two hours really. But this does continue the series and it is a worthwhile listen for anyone that has enjoyed the series so far.,ending was great but took a very long time to get there with a lot of repetition. I feel the book was good saved by the ending but otherwise was harder to get through,I am loving listening to this series after reading the books many years ago.,Rosamund Pike reading them was magical, the switching between two narrators can be disconcerting and disjointed but overall I am enjoying these books. Onto book 4!,This is my third time. I picked volume 4 after S3 of the streaming. I found the audio almost dreamlike, listening in a valley full of sunshine and birdsong while enjoying an Austin Powers themed birthday party and a look into my friend‚Äôs bicycle ride along the Silk Road.,The reading was like slipping in and out of my own dream world as we left the city behind. Listening, sleeping, going back over missed bits. Jordan‚Äôs explanation of circularity of time fitted with my reading which was non-linear. (I disagree with his assertion that circular time does not allow for change. And a little surprised, given his treatment of time is more like a spiral with flickers of parallel universes.),The narrators bring all characters alive. The balance of me and female reflects the theme of the two aspects of the One Power.,The interview with Jordan at the end provides good insight into his thinking.,I can't wait to start thenextbook. keeping me up but we'll worth it thoroughly recommend"
Alastair,"Fantasy,Urban",Romance,"I‚Äôm going to miss these guys so much. What a great end to a fantastic series.,A very satisfactory ending to an amazing series! As good as this was there is no way you could enjoy this as your first read. I knew when they had ""killed"" Lucifer 6hrs into a 14hr book that we were being bamboozled...and it made me eager to see how the rest of this would play out. I loved that Alistair and Lazares found there way to each other after thousands of years...as did the 8th unknown lost sin Melancholy and his mate. This book had a large cast and it felt like everyone had their moment in the sun - I love when authors are able to manage this - so I tip my invisible hat to Jaclyn Osborn. Nick J. Russo is an amazing performer..I couldn't imagine anyone else handling this series better.,,5 stars - I would defintely listen again,,I cannot believe this series is done!! Ever since listening to the first book, I have been anxiously waiting for each new one to drop! The plot, the romance, the adventure and fantasy! It‚Äôs all incredible. This book was so good too! I loved getting to hear Alistair‚Äôs side and finally getting to hear how Pride made him act/react. And the conclusion!! Ugh! I am so sad this is over. Like legitimately don‚Äôt know what to do with myself now. Jaclyn, I need you to write more books like these ASAP!! Nick J. Russo is such an insanely talented narrator! He‚Äôs an instant buy for me but he really outdid himself in this series! His range is just mind blowing. Can‚Äôt say enough good things!,I was on the fence about this book. I knew around the time I read book 2 who Alastair's mate was going to be and I wasn't sure how I felt about it. So I wasn't really that excited to start the book.,Yet I can easily say that I really enjoyed the book! It was SO GOOD üòç I was incredibly surprised by how much I like the love interest. He and Alastair were cute together and the book gave a satisfying ending to the Fallen Sons series!,Alastair is the seventh and final book in the Sons of the Fallen series and the series would be best read in order.,It‚Äôs rare that a final book in a well loved series can live up to expectations, but Alastair was the most perfect, epic and astounding way to complete the series we have grown to love.,I did not expect to be so emotional! I constantly had tears in my eyes and joy in my heart. Anger, sadness, relief ‚Ä¶ words can not describe this ending.,Each of these guys have carved a place in my heart and refuse to relinquish it.,At the beginning of this series I was unsure about whether I would continue reading it, however, it quickly became one of my favourite series, each book getting better and better. None of the books previously has even come close to brilliance of Alastair.,I was surprised to learn about Alastair and Lazarus, I was unsure how their relationship would work but now I can‚Äôt imagine them without each other. This book was so good (this word doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe how good it was) that I felt truly inspired to write this review. The words poured straight out of my heart. I‚Äôve struggled to do reviews lately so just the fact I am writing one is a testament to how brilliant Alastair is.,Nick J. Russo narrates this audio. This new-to-me narrator absolute blew me away with his performance. This book holds a special place in my heart so I was worried that the emotion would be lost through the narration but I had no reason to worry; Russo did such a fantastic job, I was moved to tears.,I‚Äôm so pleased that we might see these guys again in future books, I‚Äôm looking forward to a book about Michael and Konnar.,This book does mention triggering content such as violence and death.,Plot: üìöüìöüìöüìöüìö,Character rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,World building: üåéüåéüåéüåéüåé,Heat: üî•üî•üî•,Feels: üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§,Writing style: üñäüñäüñäüñäüñä,Eye-catching cover: üå∫üå∫üå∫üå∫,Narration by Nick J.

C. S. Lewis Essential Audio Library,"Classics,European,Christian Literature & Art,Spirituality,Essential Library",Literature & Fiction,"Really worth a credit, awesome collection of Christian classics. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Christianity or wanting a deeper understanding.,I have always been a fan of his works. And this audiobook brought a new energy to these classics! the performance of the narrators was wonderful. job well done. and thankful now to be reconnecting to these writings through audible! this is a must have for Christian living today.,I was excited to find such a good package of Lewis' works available for easy listening. So far, I have finished listening to Mere Christianity. The narrator was terrific. I expect the other books in this collection will be of great quality too. I do not agree with Lewis on everything he taught (his views on Free Will & the Atonement, for example), but there is much gold to be mined here! His words are insightful, thought-provoking, and challenging. Every Christian can and should glean from Lewis' perennial wisdom. His whit, humor, and memorable illustrations will keep you hooked. His spiritual insights and piercing analysis will keep you thinking deeply about God, humanity, the world, and your faith. This was the best deal on Audible I could find for 1 credit. Add it to your library today!,There are so many gems of wisdom in this compilation. I believe anyone, under any circumstances in life, can find something hereThat they need to feel whole, or to renew a sense of purpose, direction, or meaningful faith.,This collection offers thought provoking yet a warm style of well placed entertainment.  While each book within this anthology are vastly different, my thoughts are; most would be hard pressed to find disappointment within this collection. C.S. Lewis was an incredible genius, much gifted in sharing his thoughts and beliefs to his readers.  These books have actually had a great impact on my life during a time I needed it most and I will continue to re-listen and quite possibly order the hard copies to add to my library to physically read.  I cannot imagine anyone not gaining something substantial from this collection, whether you agree or disagree with the messages, you won't walk away feeling empty or cheated from time well spent.  Enjoy!,I thoroughly enjoyed this compilation of some of C. S. Lewis‚Äôs greatest works. The narration is impeccable!,Famous philosophy that is often quoted in scholarly work. This collection is like a drink from a spring in the woods;  clear, cool, deeply refreshing.,While every book is excellent, in particular, The Great Divorce was outstandingly excellent in every way. Should be a play.,I have read and listened and read most of these works before and could listen again and again. George MacDonald stretched on but there were many insights I had not thought of before. The readers were very good.,Should be mandatory reading for the world. The author has some incredibly profound thoughts, examples and a very creative way of delivery."

Fire and Song,"Adventure,Cyberpunk,Military",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Im around 3 hours in maybe a bit more and it‚Äôs meh.  He decided to do the cliche.  Orphan character gets strong and suddenly has wealthy powerful family coming to find him.,Added a trans character to be on that band wagon.  It could completely become a decent character no clue.  But at the stage I‚Äôm at it seems like it was just tossed in to get that sweet sweet trans clout.,I doubt I‚Äôll finish it.  I might, I enjoyed the first one.  But this one so far just screams that the author is throwing things against the wall to draw in as many people as possible and hope something sticks.,With the trans character it was almost like he couldn‚Äôt wait to reveal the character was trans so he could start getting the high 5s for having a trans character.  If you want to have an impactful character you don‚Äôt have to tell all their life story in the first time you meet them.  Especially a secondary character let that slow play action happen so your like oh hey didn‚Äôt expect that.,But instead the first book established that he was given up by his parents because they couldn‚Äôt afford his treatment.  But now they are super rich and his grandfather comes looking for him.  Even if that is the case again slow play shit.  3 hours into the second book he‚Äôs already destroyed one of the interesting character traits from the first book.,I almost half expect the character to wake up and all the bad stuff that happened in his life was a dream.,I had high-hopes for fire and song but the book turned out to be a predominantly dramatic story that left me feeling emotionally drained and disappointed. The author was more interested in creating emotional chaos than thrilling action scenes. Fire and song wasn't the uplifting or engaging experience I had anticipated, and it left me in a mood that was anything but pleasant.,,If you're into heavy drama, this might be your thing, but if you want a fast-paced book full of action, look elsewhere.,,,I haven't been this disappointed by a sequel to one of my favorite books since Ready Player 2.,,Bryce: I loved your first book. The world you created was original and interesting. The characters were relatable and fun. So, why did you have to turn this into a low budget, made for TV sci-fi version of Twilight? The story felt like it went absolutely no where and Rei went from a protagonist I was actively cheering for to a secondary character from a CW TV show. You need to get Luke Chmilenko back on board because this just didn't cut it.,,Luke Daniels: Dude. Ireland and France are not the same place. Also, not everyone with red hair needs to be read with a bad Irish accent. A lot of us listened to the Completionist Chronicles. We get that you like to do over the top accents. Come on though, man. You're a professional. If you're going to do bad accents, then at least make them consistent. This performance felt like you realized how bad the book was halfway in and decided to knock back 2 dozen beers and wing the rest of it.,,Sigh, i only wanted one thing from this series and this author pair and they completely failed.  All i wanted was for the Side characters to remain relevant, they do not.  Everyone who is not the MC is only there to praise and hype him up.  The authors don't even bother depicting any of the battles that aren't MC specific even if they are really important to the main six.  It is completely baffling to me.  At this point this book is just a very well written Mary Sue.  The MC does no wrong and everyone loves him.  Anyone who doesn't is obviously the bad guy.  It pretty damn annoying.  I hate this, i really like the premise and the narrator and the story is genuinely interesting when we aren't constantly harping on how amazing Rai is when his only distinguishing attribute is that he got a lucky break.  Seriously, his friends work just as hard as he does, are as driven as he is, are as skilled as he is.  Yet their accomplishments are barely noted, while Rai sneezes and there is a a bunch of people ready to tell him how he sneezed in the most spectacular amazing and world changing way.  The whole thing is getting really REALLY tedious.  He won the lottery, thats it.  Yet by the way everyone acts you would think he single handedly created the world.  It's just disappointing,   All i wanted to see was Viv, Aria, Kesh, Cather, and grants get a little love and have their real accompishments shown in detail, instead they were nothing more than Rai's entourage and cheer squad.  I don't know if i will continue with this series this one has really put a bad taste in my mouth.,Viv annoys the hell out of me. she's such a hypocrite. The narrators voices sound like he's telling a bedtime story to a young child. The ridiculous voices bring me out of the story. I wish the narrator reviewed the voices from the previous book, because most of them are pretty different between the 2 books. The story doesn't progress much, kinda felt like filler. Sad we waited 3 years for this.,The first 15 minutes is about clothes shopping. After waiting for 2+ years, the book open with clothes shopping.,The next hour and 45 minutes is teen romance drama.,The story doesn't move until the half way point in the book. 15 hours of drama and fluff before the book gets going.,The Viv/Grant situation was handled the way so many said it would be, it wasn't. It is an unnecessary and contrived source of drama that dilutes the story and is pure fluff to pad the run time. Character assassination at its finniest.,The narrator changed the accent of several of the characters, for some reason he changed the pronunciation of phalanx to phalongx. It is annoying and takes me out of the story every time he says phalongx.,The first ""battle"" is the worst of the series. It goes on for for to long and is the "" the anime characters stand around thinking"" cliche.,The battles in this book pail in comparison to the previous book.,A few of the questions, from the previous book, are answered but many many more are not.,,Overall this book was not worth the wait and I hope it gets back on course if the author publishes book 3.,it seems to go a little backwards as far as maturity of characters, at some points its a teenage soap opera, I found myself skipping through those scenes would've like to hear more about some of the things hinted at in the shadows, maybe more on the family front. it took a long time for this sequel and while it racks up the hours, its seemingly slowed down. based of the stages of competition it looks like each book going forward will correspond with a competitive event as the focus. I am a little underwhelmed, the first was really a lot better all around.,the story is great and the characters are too but the narrator changed almost all characters accent. one of the main characters that was french with a french accent now had an Irish accent and that's just the change of a main character,I only have a few problems with this book. The first is the angst with which the main cast deal with every problem. I understand that they are teenagers but it gets annoying after the first 10 times. My second problem stems from the first it has to be viv. I find her extremely annoying she has need to get extremely angry every time something happens to the mc. She just sees red and goes f the consequences (not a quote but similar thought) ‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt do this but I‚Äôm angry so I don‚Äôt care‚Äù. After that happened I just wanted to skip all her povs because I didn‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt have a problem with any other characters.,,This book was enjoyable,  couldn't stop listening from the time I got it at 2am in the morning.,Didn't even go to sleep the next night I was so intrigued.,However.... I agree with some of the others that there was a lot of filler with unnecessary drama.,Granted the filler was entertaining and some of it was absolutely necessary for building a strong team foundation.,A lot of it was just over done and I would have preferred more story progression .,I  can't say I'm disappointed,  but I will admit I was hoping things would go farther and that some of that filler would at least have been with his family or with the ongoing war efforts instead.,That being said I'm extremely excited for the next book and will be waiting for it with great anticipation.,I'm encouraged that with a lot of the internal relationship and foundation building processes out of the way in this book , the next one will be able to have a lot more actual story progression.,I do pray it won't be 3 years until the next book.,I think I may die if I have to wait that long again Lol!,,I'll start with what I like. Rei and Aria's relationship was very well done just like in the first book it felt very natural with solid progression and overall was very wholesome, it was my personal highlight of this book. Taking Logan as my most hated character to being if not likeable at least understandable is an achievement I wasn't expecting to happen. Lastly, the fights themselves were still very fun like in the previous book.,,With that being said. This book reads like it was written by a teenage daydreamer who has no friends, no significant other and fantasies about being in situations that make them feel important. The entire book feels like a desperate attempt at vicariously living through Rei's life. The opening chapter of Rei and Aria having their first date, which then gets interrupted by four cad user boys who try to intimidate Rei and force Aria to ""hang"" out with them is such a basic fantasy of a person who dreams of being able to fight the bullies and win the girl, thats its honestly laughable. But this is just my overall impression of what i felt while listening to this book. to get into more specifics of what i didnt like that i can recall:,,Pacing. Yikes. Talk about talking around anything always forever dragging out every single thing, every situation with needless filler words. Characters repeating what others say in different ways for no reason just to increase the run time just to come to the obvious point that the reader has already figured out and the chapter should have been over 50% sooner. See what i did there? Imagine that but through id say half of the book.,,Catcher becomes more of a background character used almost entirely for comedic purposes. He has moments, but very few.,,Cashe was already the least known side character and STILL is. You can't introduce a side character joining the main group at the end of the first book, and by the end of the second book have that side character STILL be so unknown and undeveloped. she is a nothing burger of a character. just a body to fill the party.,,The story is the same as the previous book basically. School drama, get stronger, tournament arc, big bad guys still coming for humanity in the distant future. End.,,Holy hell, the reactions by the characters to ANYTHING that happens is so overly dramatic. Writing this out, I realised characters basically go through the same 8 step program on almost all important events that occur: 1. Separate oneself from the group. 2. Start acting strange by ghosting everyone. 3. Wait for the group to realise your disappearance or strange behaviour and send one if not all parties to go find said person. 4. said person finally confessions important development to someone/s. 5. shocked reaction. 6. said person responds to shocked reaction by saying something stupidly redundant, often just ""...Yeah..."" 7. talk it out some more. 8. come back to the group and fill everybody in on the new world changing news. THIS happens multiple times! i mean jesus christ.,,Powerups coming from pushing or being pushed insanely past personal limits inducing major pain, often physically crippling for a couple days, instead of hard work and being smart. I don't think this was the case in book 1, but maybe I'm wrong. Either way i don't like this development. The way Rei gets his major powerup, and it has NOTHING to do with him other than surviving. is the most boring way a protaganist can get stronger.,,my last criticism that I can recall, the humour. Wow. These characters are not funny a lot of the time. The amount of times people are quiping back and fourth and one gets the final joke in and the whole group laughs or chuckles is insane considering the joke wasn't creative or funny at all. In fact the joke tends to be the most OBVIOUS coming joke possible. Im not a comedian, but when i can predict the exact joke coming multiple times without thinking, then what the hell am i doing wasting my time here?,,,,,To me this story is super slow paced with the main characters being edgy and always in horrible pain.,For a story called warformed there is no war and no real stakes, just useless tournaments we are told are not very important. Then suddenly the MC is tortured the he grows stronger. Improvement only come with suffering not through repetition or smart decisions and learning.,The series is universally praised in most forums of discussion, but I've failed to connect with it in the same way.,it's a mostly classic ""Magic School"" / ""Tournament Arc"" story that I find is not entertaining when it's not engaging in either of those two categories.,The subject matter dances occasionally into romance/trauma but I don't think this is very well done. Non of the characters have believable dialogue for people of their stated age, and the prose throughout could do with some fat trimming.,For a book this long I would hope that it had been edited into a streamlined and impressive narrative, but I needed up listening on 1.7-2.0 times speed just to get through the over inflated dialogue and descriptions. I've enjoyed books from the authors in the past but this series just isn't it fo me I'm afraid,I‚Äôm really enjoying this series. Has some great elements to it. Sometimes repeats information at bit to much but still great,This series is fast becoming one of my favourite. The storytelling is superb and the characters are fantastic.,I can't wait until the next book comes out.,gonna say this series is very very good I'm glad I was recommended this by a Facebook group I follow and the bloopers at the end were hilariously funny I hope they come back in future books,I can't wait for book 3 the story is amazing and Fire Song are incredible!,Love the story, love the characters and love the writing.,,The only thing I would say; is that this could have been half the length and nothing would have been lost. It is very wordy..  For example, when a fight is just about to happen, you can switch off for a full minute or two and not miss a thing.  This is also not a bad thing; when a great moment appears (and there are lot's of them!) you really get to appreciate them in their entirety.,,Having said that, this is my favourite series right now; pure genius.,,,A lot slower pace than the first book.,Only one thing of note has happened in the 20+ hours I have listened.,This is an amazing carry on from the first book. Good story, good fight scenes and good progression. Really looking forward to the 3rd book. The only thing I can pick up is in the first book aria had a French accent, in the second book sort of sounds slightly Scottish or something but not French.,Over all good book.,Loved it!  A great follow up and I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!  I can‚Äôt believe they need me to write more words‚Ä¶.,Have been waiting impatiently for the second book of the series for so long and it did not disappoint amazing as always,One of the best storys i have listened to cant wait for the rest of the series shame the next book is not until 2025,enjoyed it but could have probably 5hrs shorter without the repetition of conversations, and the teen melodrama was cringe.,,was a great listen. I would have binged the whole thing if I could stay awake that long.  but I think Ray said it best with the dam cliffhangers don't make us wait as long for the next one I don't think I could stand it.,I'm usually into mediaeval style of fantasy but this was something different. had me hooked even more than the first book and had me listening every second I could spare,realy cool world the story was built in. looking forward to seeing where the story goes.,One of those special stories that has you wanting more. Narrator did an awesome job as well.,solid character development, well written, but so much talk between teen characters it eventually comes close to wanting to skip bits as they just keep saying the same thing. for 30-60 mins they will have dialogue between characters, which does develop characters but at a level of chat that makes you think you are listening to teenage dramas for hours. So great capture of characters but a little less listening to teen dramas would have been nice.,Just epic!! Great story! Great banter iv listened to the first book 12+ times and the second boo will be the same! Can‚Äôt wait for the story to continue!"
A Game of Thrones,"Movie, TV & Video Game Tie-Ins,Action & Adventure,Dragons & Mythical Creatures,Epic",Literature & Fiction,"Great story and fantastic narration. I have nothing to add on that front.,About the quality, however...once an hour a sentence repeated itself. I'm assuming they recorded from a CD where the last sentence of a disc is repeated as the first sentence of the next disc. Also, the last 40 minutes of Audible's Part 3 were repeated at the beginning of Part 4. Not at all on par with Audible's usual quality...surprising and disappointing that they would let one of their best sellers go out in this condition.,Game of Thrones is an excellently written series, and the books should be recorded with a narrator who does it justice.  Roy Dotrice is an absolute legend and his speaking voice is excellent, however he fails to be a good fit for this series.  I got through the first two books and gave up somewhere around the third GOT book ,solely because of the narration.,,All the characters sound like old men, even the ones in their 30s and 40s.  Many of the voices have that wet, mealy-mouthed, too much saliva in my throat sound and it is SO distracting.  Drogo sounds like a poor imitation of a cholo gangbanger.  I understand the narrator was elderly when he recorded this, but when he attempts to give the characters voices it is just awful and cheesy.,,Hopefully audible will listen to the countless complaints about this series and invest in re-recording the GOT books with a new and superior narrator.  May I suggest Ray Porter?  He would do a stupendous job with this material and finally the series would get a talented voice to match the quality of the writing.,,For now, with the current narrator I can't recommend this purchase unless you truly don't mind bad narration and it won't bother you.,Love, love, looooooove this series but good lord-this guy's terrible.  I don't understand all the people that like his performance?! His range is horrible.  He uses ever so slight variations on the same 2 voices over and over, sometimes inconsistently changing his voice for various parts.  His only saving grace, for me, is I recognize he has a nice voice but he would have been better off not trying to change his voice at all and just doing straight reading.  Michael Kramer would have been brilliant narrating this series.,I read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi, and I can promise you that this series of books is among the best.,,This tale takes place in a land known as the ""Seven Kingdoms.""  However, these kingdoms are actually ruled by a single King with various Lords under him.  The history of these kingdoms is expertly blended into the plot, so that you effortlessly become emersed into the world.  I can't overstate the skill with which the author draws the reader into his world.  It feels as if this land, with its people, traditions and history is as real as our own.,,Magic does exist in this world, but it is rare.  It is used to color the plot, not to dominate it.  There are hints of other races, but varieties of humans are all we encounter.  There is some profanity, but it's fairly rare and in context.  There is some sexual content.  I wouldn't recommend this book for children.,,Large sections of the plot revolve around the ""palace intrigue"" of the King, his family and the Lords.  This is a book about the nobles of this realm and, as the title suggests, the high stake games they play for power.  The characters in the book are deep, colorful and simply splendid.  Their lives have a depth to them that few authors accomplish.  I confess that, when not reading the book, I actually thought about them during the day and laid awake wondering about them at night.  In the audio version, the narrator does a wonderful job of giving voice to these vivid characters.,,The plot has numerous twists and turns.  Sometimes I think the author intentionally speculates about what the reader would expect in the plot of a fantasy novel, and then does something completely different.  I gave up trying to predict what would happen, and decided to just enjoy the ride.  However, there is an overall ""master"" plot that is slowly unveiled in this and subsequent books.,,If you enjoy fantasy, this is a must read.  Even if you usually don't like fantasy, you may very enjoy this one.,What didn‚Äôt you like about Roy Dotrice‚Äôs performance?,Dotrice makes a slew of mistakes and errors that should have been caught with editing and multiple takes. Not only does he occasionally trip over lines, but he doesn't seem to know how to pronounce a single name in this entire book.  It's incredibly jarring to listen to Brian and P-tire and Sancha.  Not only that, but his voices are frequently distracting. Aftere being spoilt for talent in the show, the caricature voices are either too difficult to understand, like Varys slurring his words disgustingly, or downright insulting, as with the strange Warwick Davis impression he seems to be doing for Tyrion.,I sincerely hope to find other narrators for the subsequent books, because I have no intention of continuing this series with Dotrice narrating.,I am without words.... This book is just epic! I am still reeling from the captivating storyline and the amazing narration! This is what mature fantasy literature is all about, it is magical and yet feels so realistic. The vast array of characters are engaging and beautifully developed. The characters age so realistically in the book and the many sub-plots and intertwining leaves you just wanting more and more. The narration is so spot on I can't think of anyone else that could do this book any more justice, Roy Dotrice, you are just plain great. This was one of those books that you CANNOT stop listening to. I mean I listened to this book non stop, going to bed some UNREAL hours because of it. I am so impressed, so so so impressed!,I should start off by saying that my comments will not pertain to the story, plot, characters or descriptions contained within ""A Game of Thrones.""  If you are curious about these things, other reviewers have described them at length and in a far better manner than I ever could.  If I was just going to judge this book based on its content, I would have given it the highest score possible.,,However, I was sorely disappointed by the quality of this audio book.  It is obvious that the producers did not spend a good deal of time reviewing these recordings or they would have noticed several things.,,First - The narrator does not pronounce character names the same every time he says them.  Within the first six hours, I heard Lady Stark referred to as CAT-LYNN, CAT-EH-LYNN, and CATE-LYNN.  I also heard Prince Joffrey referred to as Jeffrey, Theon referred to as both THEE-ON and THAY-ON  and the man somehow managed to put an ""h"" into Sansa's name several times.  There are similar problems with some of the place names and words invented by the author. This is distracting, to say the very least.,,Second - No less than three times during the first six hours, a small portion of the text was repeats at least twice (either due to a poor editing cut or some sort of glitch with a track break).,,Third - When not reciting dialogue, the narrator's voice is fairly flat and monotonous.  During scenes of heavy description/exposition (the set-up for the tournament, for example) this slows the pace of the book to a crawl.,,IN short, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wanted to read it, but I would suggest that they stay away from the audio version.  Sadly, the others in the series have the same narrator, so I suspect that they suffer from the same problems.  I, however, am not going to spend the money to find out.,Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the television series. There are some differences, but the history is richer in the novel(s) and I found it easier to follow.,However, Mr. Dotrice's narration leaves a lot to be desired. His voice is harsh and gruff, which doesn't lend itself to a plethora of various characters (I found the voice of Tywin especially obnoxious - forcibly pompous, uttering 2 or 3 words between lengthy pauses and breaths, like the worst caricature of a fat old British member of parliament). His interpretation of the pronounciation of the characters' names was inconsistent - ""Joffrey"" became ""Jeffrey"" at one point, ""Hodor"" was used interchangeably with ""Hodar,"" and the Stark matriarch was sometimes ""Catt-lin"" and other times ""Cait-lin,"" just to name a few. Narration of dialogue in a character's voice sometimes carries over into non-dialogue parts (i.e. reading ""...said Arya"" in Arya's voice). I found myself actually surprised this recording was given the thumbs-up for release, especially for a story so wildly popular as this one.,The narration almost ruins the book for me. I so wished for a different narrator for the remainder of the series, but alas - if you want to experience Game of Thrones on audiobook, this is what you're stuck with.,What did you like best about A Game of Thrones? What did you like least?,I love this series. I've read it already but decided to go through it again, but this time through audible.,How could the performance have been better?,In a story that is built off the richness and complexity of characters, it behooves the narrator to familiarize himself with the names, ages, and personalities of at least the main cast. This guy consistently misreads names, puts on an idiotic oaf voice for large and fierce characters, narrates a teenage boy's dialogue in the voice of an old man, and makes practically every other make character out in the same gruff voice. Completely ruins the diversity and dynamics of this great sory.,Further, after 30+ hours of him, I can say his prose and tone at times are just odd. They confuse the meaning of the passages and are littered with random pauses and abrupt continuations. It's like an actor breaking the fourth wall. His performance really jars you out of the story and is completely distracting.,Any additional comments?,It's a crime this guy goes on to narrate several more books in this series. I hope he improves, he's just awful.,Would you recommend this book to a friend? Why or why not?,I've listened to over 50 audiobooks at this point, and this is the first time I have ever had such a negative experience with a narrator. Horrible! The voices are not even remotely aligned with the age or personality of the characters. A 15 year old sounds like a shaking voiced 80 year old. Just awful. So disappointed. So, no I wouldn't recommend the audiobook to anyone, especially people who are sensitive to bad narrators. But i've powered through and am on book 4 at this point- purely because I love the series that much.,What didn‚Äôt you like about Roy Dotrice‚Äôs performance?,Everything. I am praying that with the renewed interest in this series, they will redo the audiobooks. Tyrion Lannister is the absolute worst though. I almost can't listen to it, it's so grating and annoying.,I've been told by everyone I know that this is an amazing story and couldn't wait to hear it. That said I think I will buy the Kindle version as I simply cannot get past the narration production. I've been too spoiled by outstanding Audible books to slog through here. I'm sure I will be hooked once I have read it myself..."
Forbidden Desires: The Complete Series,"Anthologies,Anthologies & Short Stories,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"This is one of the naughtiest,  sexiest,  dirty,  yet fulfilling series I have listened to and I loved it. Didn't know I was such a naughty girl myself.  These Kingsley Brothers are just so Alpha, sexy, needy and all male.  I am still blushing!,3 broken brothers who had angst, broken hearts and found love. I think my favorite was Gavin and Emma's story. It took 2 books to tell their story and the passion was oozing from these books.,Megan and Zachary were fabulous narrators in this series. And who doesn't love listening to Zachary Webber. That mans voice is a secret weapon!!! And Joe Arden as Quinn was wonderful.,I loved these books, the writing and the narrators.  They made you feel the heat and passion and some panting too. Been listening all weekend and thank you to Kendall Ryan.,,1st I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Zachary Webber, his voice is so HOT can not be match.  I got a few chapters in from the 2nd book and told myself that if Emma Bell showed one more display of weakness I was done listening. I'm all for the strong sexy submissive and the sizzling dom, there is always a level of trust. However when Emma thought Gavin had murdered his ex then agreed to leave town with him on a private jet anyway,  I had it with the story. If Emma would have had more of a back bone it would have been a great story I'm sure.....,Book 1 so far is TRASH.. Emma is so weak and child like I decided to fast forward and keep going paying it'll get better.. HORRIBLE & A HARD NO!!,This audio was just ok for me.  The narrators ZW and JA was always a pleasure to listen to.  However what I did not like was the weakness of these women.  Women are not that week no matter how difficult their pass.  The Kingsley brothers all had a rough up bringing but they turned out to be rich, strong and powerful men.  Why hadn't the women also turned out strong if not rich and powerful; but they were all so weak and needy.  This was a downfall for me.,,Another downfall was allowing two brothers to fall in love with the same woman.  Even though in the end one of them found love in someone else however this did not seem realistic.  Another downfall.,,,All the characters are very likeable and interesting with relatively low drama situations.,Bedroom scenes are detailed enough to be sexy without over doing it. The narrators also did an outstanding job!!,For the amount of listening hours and well written story lines this is so worthy of a credit.,,It waas just OK! Nothing I would care to listen to again. All three brothers married so quickly after meeting their woman makes it a little unbelievable.... yes I know it's fiction but I like when the story is a bit realistic.,The main problem I have with this book is the female lead, Emma. The writer makes her spineless, brainless and pathetic. This story is worse than Fifty Shades of Grey. A mega millionaire with a body sculpted by Michelangelo himself, hung like a horse, with an overly dominant personality that requires submission from whatever idiot girl that falls all over him due to his looks and money. All due to no father and a mother that was a whore and drug addict. Remind you of anything Mr. Grey?! The most ridiculous story line ever created. This kind of crap should never be written and even it was, it should never gain popularity. This kind of story sets women back at least 50 years. I am not a feminine rights activist by any means but this kind of horribly written crap enrages me. No woman would ever let a guy treat her like this and no real man would ever want a woman with no mind of her own that felt she was alive just to please his every whim. It is not sexy to be ordered about and talked to like an animal given a command for a treat. Come to think of it, that is exactly what the sex scenes are like to listen to, among other parts of this messed up story. A master giving his dog a command and without following it she will not get her treat which he thinks is himself. The irony to all of this is he calls her pet!!!!! It‚Äôs laughable to listen to the story with this kind of scenario in your head. A dog instead of a person. That is how this girl is treated. I cannot express enough how horrible this crap is. To be manipulated in thinking you love this guy and willing to do anything he wanted to get just one look, one kind word thrown your way. There is nothing good about crap like this. In my personal opinion, this speaks to the lack of competence of the writer.,I the first 2 are great.,I felt short changed with Connor and even more with Quinn.  The first  relationship with Emma and Gavin spanned 2 books...we could watch the development.  The last 2 were basically insta love...no angst..no drama.  I particularly had wanted so much more fleshing out and a deeper dive into Quinn as the oldest but he was basically Connor.  I hate to say it but Im disappointed.,You wont be sorry to use your credit on this one! üëç,I loved how Kendall Ryan wrote 3 books in one.  Each book was fabulous sexy and exciting. The narrator's were great!  2 of my best sext Male voice's ~ yummy üòçüíã,Now you know... I'm going to have to listen to all whole books again...üòú,Loved it,Nice story,Goodread,Narrators are wery believable,I give 5* only when I will read it again.,First book was really enjoyable, although the female author did my head in for a lot of it. Over-the-top pronunciation affected the flow of the story; this didn't happen with the same narrator in the following books. The male narrator was great in all bar the 4th book, where the tone was repetitive and every sentence sounded like an aggressive statement.,,The story starts of well, but every book follows the same plot format, albeit involving a different brother each time. I'd give the first two books 4/5, and the third 3/5 and the fourth 2/5.,,Sweet romance following 38 year old Quinn Kingsley (gosh how I love these brothers), as he starts a ‚Äòwould be‚Äô relationship with his new Italian tutor, 22 year old Alessandra. Sadly the older Kingsley brother is not going to be getting his HEA because Alessandra has got her heart set on moving to Italy.  A wonderful easy romance, I loved both Alessandra and Quinn (I also loved the banter with his brothers), I loved that there was an age gap between them.  The writing was spot on, the narration was perfect (I adore Joe Arden), I just enjoyed.,,I loved the 1st and 2nd stories, but I found the 3rd story a little weak.,Three great love stories(the first ones a two parter) ,and brilliant  narration throughout all four books.,The series follows the three Kingsley brothers. Book 1-2 follow Gavin book 3 Cooper ‚ù§Ô∏è Book 4, Quin,Cooper is my favourite brother, he's like the ideal man for me. You'll enjoy delving into their love lives and following the drama that unfolds. I would recommend these books. I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to them.,Anyone who has read fifty shades will find similarities. That said it was an okay listen. Zachary Webber is excellent at voicing the men. The last book was spoilt due to the change of narrator.,Over long stories, boring, and with inane characters. Even the 3-4-1 credit didn‚Äôt make up for story lines which swing from misogyny to pathetic attempts to make the male protagonist‚Äôs behaviour acceptable.,I‚Äôm shocked these books have so many good reviews. Which is unfortunate because they are what convinced me to buy the books.,A fantastic read of 3 brothers finding the love of their lives. Each story is different but so romantic you just can‚Äôt stop listening. Highly recommend reading,I thoroughly enjoyed every one of the books in this series.  I loved the romance, and the thoughtfulness of the Kingsley Men who looked after their dates, by delivering beautiful gowns and accessories for the events.,As usual the narrators were excellent at bringing the characters to life.  My favourites in this series are: Zachary Webber and Joe Arden.  Both the female narrators did a great job too.  This was the first time I had listened to Megan Tusing.,This series was well worth the credit and I will listen to the stories again.  I have added Kendall Ryan to my favourite list of authors.,I enjoyed this collection. Easy to listen to, and a twist here and there made it interesting.,But you know what you get in these types of books, and this one was just what I wanted.,What a shame I couldn‚Äôt rate each book individually.  The story of Quinn is so unbelievable it was hard to stick with it.  It‚Äôs almost like the author wrote it because she had to.,I made it all the way to the start of the 2nd book. it's very monotonous & the female narrator has her work cut out for her. The main female character couldn't be more unlikeable and frustrating. I usually like Kendall Ryan books but this is the first book/series I haven't been able  finish.,I loved the characters and how they developed into their own stories. But we‚Äôre still included in the whole series. The narrative needed to be sped up a bit to keep it inline with the story. It kept me entertained for days. Thank you,this series was great, i felt like i was on every journey. I am hoping there will be a fourth book abought William. the narrator's were perfect, hot, sexy loving.,My, I just loved this series. About three brothers that had a rough upbringing and made something of themselves, but most important was the relationship they founded with their one. Each had a different personality. These books were just awesome.,Narration was awesome too.,love having all the brothers in one handy audible book,loving the way all the characters intertwine and the love of the brothers shine through.,great booked loved the brothers and their partners some areas dragged a little but all round great,I knew I would love these three brothers .. not only did they sound yummmmy . But the were damaged good who were thought they didn‚Äôt need love or anyone ... were they wrong .. each lady had her job cut out to win them over ... well they knew they were the ones because they were damaged too ... brilliant .. definitely worth the read .. loved it ..‚ù§Ô∏èüíã‚ù§Ô∏èüíã,love the narrators even though the 2 females ive never listened to before. and Zac oh my lorry I just swoon. Joe is my least favourite but he was ok here.,I wanted to choke Emma at some of the decisions she made. I cried for Cooper and Quinn sthould,have bopped his brothers with some of the comments they made about ally. their story was,short and sweet but it was nicely written."
Dune,"Fantasy,Space Opera",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Some passages from the text are omitted entirely , this is unacceptable. Even though the multicast performance is well read/acted it is not consistent. Some chapters are read by only the narrator and some utilize the multicast. Some chapters start with the multicast then part way through it switches to being read only by the narrator. This means that characters have different voices from one minute to the next, this is jarring and confusing.,I have read this book multiple times, it is a classic, one of the greatest sci-fi novels of all time. It deserves an audiobook with much more attention to detail and care then what is shown in this audiobook.,I wish I had read the reviews. not the full story even though they bill it as unabridged. and voice acting and music. I want an audio book. Not a dramatization. I bought it over a year ago so I can't return it.,Morale of the story, read who is the narrator (of more than one name don't get it), and read the reviews.,Only parts of the book have a full cast of actors, most of the time the narrator does every characters voice and sometimes even the voice actors themselves change between chapters. Very jarring, completely misleading.,This is not an unabridged audiobook. It's a really badly done audio drama. The voice acting sounds unnatural and unconvincing. The narrator isn't so bad but the dialogue is grating and difficult to follow. There is also this weird ambient background effect that I guess was supposed to be for dramatic effect or something, but it comes off as amateurish and is very, very distracting. The whole thing is a complete mess. I only made it about 15 minutes before I gave up.,The story is fantastic.,The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the structure of this audio book.,It is theatrical with many characters (many voices) and then it changes to the main narrator who will also do his own versions of the character's voices.,It would have been better if it was either narrated by one person or a theatrical presentation with many actors, but not both.,I hope that I made this review clear.,The story itself is fantastic. Deservedly hailed as one of the greatest stories ever told, sci-fi or otherwise. A fully realized and richly detailed alternate universe filled with science, religion and political intrigue. A must read.,,Unfortunately, the audio recording does not fulfill expectations. While far better than the original single reader audiobook (be glad you didn't spend 25 hours listening to THAT) the 2007 version is marred by the bizarre decision to have each reader read a chapter or section rather than have each reader read a character's part throughout the book. In other words, the voices for each character change throughout the book!!! Why? Baron Harkkonen's voice suffers the most. At one point it sounds like Michael Clark Duncan is voicing him and others it sounds like a sleepy Orson Welles.,,It's a shame that one of the greatest books ever written has never received a proper translation into another medium. David Lynch's movie was stylistically and visually fulfilling, but the story edited and changed dramatically. The Sci-Fi channel's 3 part miniseries held more closely to the original plot, but the budget and casting left alot to be desired. The original 1997 audiobook was read in a horrible monotone and finally the 2007 version's inconsistent readers. Hopefully someday Dune will receive a treatment that it deserves.,I first read this book in 1980 in the back seat as my family did a two week camping road trip, and I loved this story. I must have read Dune over 20 times, it was that good to me. When I heard about the audio book I was a bit hesistant that they might ruin one of my favorite stories (like they did with the movie!!).,But the narration and characterization of the actors, were wonderful, giving the story a richness and fullness, a 3D immersive experience.,It made a great story that much better.,Why? Why was the book butchered and the audio cast so discombobulated? I love Dune, and was excited to hear it come to life in an audiobook with a diverse cast, but this rendering is absolutely atrocious. The music is not in line with the narrative. The cast comes in goes, chapter to chapter, sometimes paragraph by paragraph. If you can, find another adaptation audiobook of Dune, not this disconjointed mess that is not a true rendering of Frank Herbert's book. What an utter mess.,Overall this was a great listen.  However, I was somewhat annoyed how sometimes the voice of different characters were spoken by different actors, and sometimes they weren't.  At one point even within one chapter they switched back and forth which mad it somewhat confusing.  I did enjoy some of the sound effects though.  Great listen!,Frank Herbert, I OWE you.  I owe you a LOT.  This was one of the very first books that truly stirred my love for science fiction.  You SPOILED me.  You made me demand better writing from the authors I followed, and better development, as well.  From this book on, I became harder on myself, to read works that challenged me, that made me ponder well after finishing the novel.  I hungered for better writing that combined story, action, flow, cadence and for God's sake, CREATIVITY.  Thanks, Frank.,THAT'S what good writing demands of us, and if the author excels at his or her craft, this book is the perfect example of what can happen.,In Dune, you get galaxy-sweeping politics, messianic jihads, genetically-enhanced warriors and spacefarers, pirates hiding ruling classes, clones that psychically destroy their victims, fantastic ecologies and creatures, religions that manipulate families and bloodlines, and countless castes intertwined with ruling houses that all depend upon a drug found only on one desolate planet - A planet with its own secret and massive agenda, hidden within the howling desert plains covering its surface.  And wait, it's followed by yet ADDITIONAL novels in the series, some better than others, and then yet ANOTHER series by the author's SON, done decades later, that provides tremendous PREQUELS, based on his father's notes?  Finally, throw in excellent male and female narrators that fit the characters they portray, and individualize each character.,Come on.  Do you really need another great review to buy this audiobook?,Please.,,I won't dwell on the book itself - it is for many the highwater mark of the sci fi genre; superbly written, richly detailed, boiling with wonderful ideas and concepts, and giving an impression of historical depth that (almost) rivals Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Rather, I'd like to comment on the audio presentation. Potential listeners should have no hesitation in downloading this immediately! Simon Vance is the main reader, and - as always! - his reading is of the highest calibre - clear, faultless pronounciation, and with a fine balance of character voicing without over-acting. Although it's billed as a full-cast reading (from the superb Audio Renaissance team), the full cast are only used on some chapters, while Simon Vance reads many chapters solo. And while I love the Audio Renaissance team, I actually found the solo Vance chapters even better. A very highly recommended listen! And what great news that the sequels will be available over the upcoming months!,I read 'Dune' in my teens and adored it - the complexities of the story and the depth to which the eco-system of the desert planet is planned are quite breathtaking.  So I was looking forward to having the audiobook so I could re-live the wonder.  Unfortunately this is a bit of a fragmented production.  The main narrator has a voice fitting to the scope of the book and reads well.  However, my guess is that originally the production company brought in other actors to read the dialogue - but for an ABRIDGED version.  But they didn't bother to use them to complete the unabridged recording.  Therefore, at some points, we have dialogue of the main characters read by other actors (often with some annoying 'atmospheric' sound effects, music or irritating echoic effects in the background).  Then at other sections of the story all the voices of dialogue are provided by the main narrator, which makes the whole thing sadly disjointed.  Ironically, I think it works far better with the narrator alone providing all dialogue - so the company could have saved themselves the cost and trouble of getting other people in and would still have ended up with a better, more choherent performance of the book.  I will still finish listening to the audiobook, just to enjoy the marvellous story, but I feel the oddities of the recording will always keep me from being completely immersed in the tale.,I do like Dune. It is a classic of science fiction. Given the current warnings from prominent scientists about AI, and the impact of religious violence on our world, it raises interesting speculation about the future. I've read the book in print several times over the last 30 years.,The narration didn't really work for me, however. The main narrator had a kind of 'grand' tone to his voice, a little too reverent, as if every sentence was a morsel of deep importance. I found myself turned off. His female voices suffered that problem many male readers have, of making them too 'fluffy' (surely not, for Jessica!), but it was the overall tone that defeated me. I didn't make it through to the end, it became a chore, so I finished it off in my printed book.,A lot of people here seem to disagree, and thought the reading was exceptional. I am very willing to accept it just didn't work for me. I prefer readers who sound like they're enjoying the story.,I first read this book years and years ago. After getting an iPod, to while away the hours at work, cnc programmer and operator, I decided to try an audio book. I went for Dune with the thought of 'I've read it, so lets see how it listens' so to speak. AMAZED. I loved every minute, got totally engrossed, beautifully read, good background mood music, thoroughly enjoyed it. Next audio book please!,I loved the 1984 film adaptation of Dune as a child, but I have never read the book.,,I went through this audio book, Twice! In one week. What a story and to think it was published in 1965.,,I really loved the way this book is written and audio production is the best I have every heard, and adds to the entertainment value.,,There is a the main narrator Simon Vance who is brilliant, but the additional narrators and ambient sounds used add more colour to the sound.,,Scifi may be back drop to this story, but the main drama is in the relationships and the characters. I urge non Scifi readers looking for a good book with great intertwining plots, varied characters told in a oracle like voice to listen to this story.,,I enjoyed this more than Lord of the Rings, which I do like. I like a long story that is well written and this is one of the best.,Dune is a book of high tension, filled with treachery, suspicion and dangerous characters with dark motives. The early scenes of this audiobook are dramatised and they capture the mood expertly. This is edge-of-the-seat stuff and makes for compelling listening. I could feel the 'gom jabar' at my own neck as my hands went all clammy! What a pity the dramatisation lessens, giving way to straight narration as the book progresses. It is read very well throughout but it could have been so much more gripping if the full cast had been retained. Another annoying gripe, common to so many audiobooks. Why can't the audio 'chapters' correspond with those in the book instead of ending randomly mid paragraph? It makes navigating a long book unnecessarily difficult.,Overall very good, but the inconsistency of the voices really bugged me. Simon Vance is great, so are the others, but having randomly cut in and out was kinda strange.,This is a great book.  One of the most detailed and compelling books i have ever read and now its even better to listen to.  Frank Herbert(author) has created an entire universe with great detail helping you to imagine each environment easily.  While it is generaly assumed that this is a sci-fi book there is no space battles and the way that Frank explains each place it is easy to fall into the assumption that its a simple fiction book.,,With voices that are very easy to listen to. You can have many an hour of fun enjoying the first in the series of books by Frank Herbert, there are also many books that continue the storyline layed out by Frank written by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson.  After listening or reading this book I can pritty much guarantee that you will want to read or listen to the next set of books.,,The only thing i would say is that currently audible uk does not have any of the other books available however they are very much worth reading.,,I hope you like this book as much as i do.  Personaly i would recomend reading the books in the following order.  I recomend this to help explain storylines. (the numbers is the number the book is currently in, in timeline order, not order of been written).  Dune(7),  (then jumping back in time about 30-40 years earlier) House Atredies(4), House Harkonen(5), House Corino(6), (jumping back to after Dune) Dune Messiah(8), Children of Dune(9), God emperor of Dune(10), (jumping back in time to many many years before Dune) The Butlerian Jihad(1), The Machine Crusade(2), The Battle of Corin(3), (now the grownding for the machines and the jihad has been established back up to after god emperor) Heretics of Dune(11), Chapterhouse: Dune(12), Hunters of Dune(13), (and the soon to be released) Sand worms of Dune(14).,,Anyway i hope you enjoy the series as much as i have and I look forward to more of the books coming onto this site.,When I was a teenager I thoroughly enjoyed (and found myself transported to) Dune and appreciated it as much as Catch 22 and Asimov's Foundation series. When I was a thirty-something I tried to enjoy the film version without much success. As a fifty-something I am amazed by the richness of the experience provided by this audiobook. The combination of straight narrative and dramatisation works to bring the book to life in a way I did not expect. I recommend listening via an iPod/MP3 player with headphones. If the spoken word can evkoe pictures in your mind, your are in for a cinematic treat!,Stop changing the front covers of audiobooks whenever a movi comes out. This needs to stop.,Any number of reviews will tell you the importance of Dune, the depth and detail that Frank Herbert has taken to craft a thrilling story, amazing characters and a universe that in 2015 is still unique.,This review however, sets to highlight that this reading of Dune is exceptionally bad. The book is read mostly by a single person (altering his voice for different characters, if only slightly) but bizarrely will have characters such as Jessica and Paul be taken over by other narrators seemingly at random parts of the story with seemingly no consistency on who is 'playing'. More confusingly a narrator for one key character, such as Leto Atreides will return later with exactly the same voice (that is to say, not altering it at all) to play a different character.,This performance is disruptive and simply not good. Either have it read by a single narrator or have some consistency with who is reading each character. The most egregious case of this was halfway through a chapter in which two key characters were talking, a small break takes place, and it returns with new narrators for these characters. Why?,The story isn't ruined however. The performers are true to the words of the book and it will not inhibit your ability to get the genuine experience but at times it is jarring and confusing.,Dune is a remarkable epic that sits at the epicenter of the genre.   As an audiobook however...this is a shambles.  Its as if the budget was expended on the atmospheric sounds effects and background music and with the funds running low the studio just randomly selected bits for the voice actors while the rest was read  by the narrator.    Not only is it confusing....its at times hilarious. In single scenes you can have three different voices for one character ( remembering Herbert's love of the third person or thoughts of his characters)...hilariously these  innermost thoughts can be a totally different actor, voice....god even accent.   there are times the primary narrator just seems to forget what voice he uses for a character....you are absolutely lost.  watch out for his attempt at Chani when she first appears...  How can I liken this experience?  Have you ever tried to make an omelette while suffering with a hangover...... with each egg you crack,  shell ends up in the bowl...no matter how much you try it just gets worse with the end result being a complete and total yoke ( egg humour)...I digress.... back to analogy... so finally after cooking the omelette you sit down ready to tuck in before throwing up last night's curry with a good helping of vodka flavoured bile. That's the feeling I had as the book ended.,wow I feel like an idiot. I thought that it was an unabridged reading. I wish there was a full copy of this book that I could listen to because I love the story.,The story is excellent, read the book when I was a teenager, seen the movie and could hardly stop listening to this audio book decades later.,The performance was very good in parts but often jarring as voice actors were not consistent with characters. That is the same character would have more than once accent or voice actor which broke immersion in the story.,What made the experience of listening to Dune the most enjoyable?,Voice was very easy to listen to and the occasional accompanying music was a good touch.,What did you like best about this story?,The voice actors - although they tend to change occasionally which can be confusing.,Have you listened to any of the narrators‚Äôs other performances? How does this one compare?,Haven't listened to others,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,The final two chapters are very exciting.,Any additional comments?,The voice actors change which makes the book a little confusing and the language of Dune can be hard to follow. Go with the flow and you'll enjoy it.,The book itself is great, a classic. The narration is a bit disappointing. They have voice actors for the major characters, but in half the book they are absent and all the characters are instead voiced by the narrator.,Dune is very ambitious, and now that I've finally read it I can see the obvious influence that it's had on lots of subsequent sci-fi and fantasy. Herbert is an excellent world-builder; there's lots of great anthropological detail about the people of Arrakis, and he has a very compelling way of writing about prophetic precognition, which is not only artful but also serves as a convenient workaround for preventing prophet characters from being omniscient and knowing everything that's going to happen in the story. World-building aside, however, I must confess to getting pretty bored with the plot around the mid-point, when Paul is just mucking around in the desert with his Fremen pals. Much like Tolkien, then, I guess Herbert's strengths lay more in ""secondary creation"" than in plotting. I'm not yet sure if I'll continue with the next entries in the series; I don't know if I want to justify pushing on if I'm going to be bored by those as well. But Dune at least had enough ambition and a sufficiently compelling world to warrant the time I spent there.,Regarding the performance of the audio version, I have to say that it was a truly baffling choice to only utilise a full cast for some portions of the book. I can only assume this was due to budgetary reasons, but this begs the question of why not to simply use a single narrator for the whole thing. The narrator they have is quite good, and could easily have carried the whole thing. The voice cast is quite good too, but the distraction of switching between them doesn't seem at all worth it.,Well read and pleasant voices. However there are inconsistent changes in voice actors which lead to confusion at the very least. Only become a problem since the voices were so good you started to miss them.,The story seems fine, if not a little underwhelming. But 6 voice actors play specific characters in certain sections of the book, then the narrator plays the same parts in different sections. It really took me out of the story having two actors play the same character in vastly different ways.,Frank Herbert's grand story barely feels like science fiction. Prepare to feel overwhelmed by the scope of story telling focusing on people, politics, planetary ecology and power struggles. Ideally it would be great to have the voice actors do every chapter, but what is here also works fine. Kudos to the voice actors and Frank Herbert for this, would strongly recommend."
A Beast as Dark as Night,,,"The entire series has been captivating. I finished all 4 in under 2 weeks!!! So so good! A lot of twists, laughs and tears."
A People's History of the United States,"Americas,Democracy,United States History",History,"This has to be the most poorly produced audiobook of all time. With a work of this length - roughly 35 hours - I understand there are several challenges in putting everything together, but here it's like whoever was doing the recording wasn't even trying. Consider. 1) Starting sometime between the 90 minute and 2 hour mark, a number of obvious and jarring cuts, with the narrator dropping out suddenly, and then resuming speech in the middle of a different sentence. This issue seems to settle down after roughly the 5 hour mark. 2) Different audio levels for different recording sessions. After a cut, the narrator returns notably louder or quieter, and with a different level of white noise in the background. 3) At the 5 hour and 46 minute mark, the narrator says ""hold on"", and then engages in a conversation with the recording engineer, and this was never edited out of the final product.  This means the publishers didn't listen to this audiobook even one time for quality control before putting it out in the wild.  Shameful, and this is a product of unacceptably low quality.  2 stars for the wealth of content and Jeff Zinn's effort in recording well over 30 hours of speech, but minus 3 stars for a final product that could have been put together better by a motivated middle schooler.,I write only in regard to the production of the audiobook, not as to the text itself, which is great and worthy.  The slovenliness of the recording, with gaps, repeats, and periods where the reader is obviously having a conversation with a third party (editor?  recording technician?) are beyond the minor and forgivable.  Are these things not edited?  Vetted by quality control?  Does no one bother to listen to an audiobook before it is mass-produced and distributed?  If no one at the publisher does, then someone at Audible ought to.,Few books have stirred such patriotic feelings in me.  It's wonderful to to live in a country, that, despite its flaws, allows a book that goes against the grain of the ""accepted narrative"" to be printed.,,Many will accuse Zinn of being biased, but that is the point.  History is, by its nature, biased from a point of view. Zinn is writing a People's history, telling events from the points of view that have long been silenced.  Anyone offended by this would be better suited for less literate works by gaseous pundits that bolster weak arguments rather than challenge the mind.,,It is true that the audio book should have been  edited before release.  I noted one long swatch of narrative that was repeated (Were there long omissions?  I may never know).  Also entertaining was a long sound check that showed fascinating insights into the workings of the audiobook recording industry.  However, the errors are few and shouldn't detract from an otherwise fascinating and vital work.,I knew what to expect to a degree. Zinn is definitely to the left of the political spectrum and I honestly found his recounting of the colonial New World and early America to be refreshing. It wasn't necessarily a simpler time and politicians were never all that great. This book came out in 1980 and it's interesting to see what was a radical idea then (Columbus was a bad guy) is now well accepted. But when he got into WW2 the constant degrading of anything American finally got to me. I don't think he says one positive thing the whole book. If a positive outcome occurs, then it's glossed over because the real intent was actually bad. He repeats several falsehoods about WW2 and leaps over a pile of positives to focus on one negative. At that point I had to stop listening.,,The narration is fine though. I don't know why people are so critical of it. Zinn's son is a perfectly good narrator and I had no problems with the editing. I'd like the content too if it wasn't so downbeat. There are some things he had an absolute right to be negative about (slavery, union busters, treatment of Blacks for 400 years) but even when things were positive he views them in too critical of a light.,This is a very good thesis, but so poorly read, its painful.,One can even hear the narrator making unedited commentary within the body of the story.  He often sounds like he is tired and out of breath.  I think they were very stingy and cheap to have this man narrate the book...I feel like I wasted my money because I cannot listen to another sentence from the inept narrator. -0 stars...,I really wish I could return this audio book...REALLY POORLY NARRATED.,I was hesitant to purchase this book due to some of the reviews regarding the narration. The Narrator was not as bad as some have said in my opinion but he was not great. This is a wonderful book and it is the book that carries the ""meh"" performance.,It certainly challenges the traditional narrative for US History. In my opinion, it was absolutely fascinating, tragic, and eye-opening. One of my all-time favorite books. Offers a completely different perspective on US History, that left me with a much greater appreciation for being an American, despite it shining a light on pieces of our history that are much more complicated and messy than the story that‚Äôs traditionally told.,Winston Churchill said that ""History is written by the victors"".  This book is told from the losers side.  Very well written and read.  If you are interested in the truth about history, you should give this book a listen.,I understand the argument Zinn explicitly makes that basically ‚Äúeveryone has a bias‚Äù and that there is no ‚Äútrue‚Äù unbiased history. But I do believe that there are history‚Äôs that do not CONSCIOUSLY insert their bias and purposefully skew facts and information to tell an external narrative they want to tell. This is not that book.,Zinn at multiple times explicitly recites false information that all supports the same narrative he has running throughout the book. These errors all run in the same direction and it is hard to imagine are not tied to Zinn holding the external narrative of the book as a higher priority than recounting history itself.  The moments that come to mind while writing this are the US firebombing at Dresden. Zinn reports the casualty figures of Nazi propaganda of the time. These figures have been refuted as false by multiple studies done after the war, including studies by the German government.  There is no reason for these figures to appear in this book.,The second one that stuck in my head was the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.  Zinn used this example to bolster the idea of Cold War hysteria in the US (something that actually did exist). Problem is, when the Soviet Union fell, it was found the Rosenbergs 100% were involved passing secrets to the Soviets.  And 100% were traitors.  I understand the Soviet Union had not yet fallen when this was first written and at the time there was room for doubt. But there have been multiple revisions released since, why has this section not been revised or removed?,Overall, the book lacks any stats, very few mentions of policy (that 100% did exist, but for some reason wasn‚Äôt focused on), and no discussion of overarching trends.  Ultimately, the book is 98% a collection of random individual accounts of many different situations.  This is fine and expected to bring color to a history book to try and immerse you in the times.  But as the entire substance of a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù book I do not understand how a random collection of personal experiences are supposed to prove any point on a national/global scale.,I found myself only being interested/intrigued in the parts of the book I had no prior knowledge of, and when I came across sections of the book I know a lot about I completely lost interest and felt like I was being read to by an ideologue that was purposefully obscuring the history to try and prove an external political point. It took me halfway through the book to realize the only reason I did not feel like that 100% of the time was that some sections of this history I was ignorant to and could not pick out what was being obscured.,I recommend any one who reads this book to approach it with that manner, if you find errors in sections you know about, you should wonder what is misinformed in the sections you don‚Äôt.,In the end, reading this as a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù book (even with agreement on history being biased) is a stretch. Zinn himself concludes the book by giving his intentions.  This is a book to restructure society, education, relations, class, etc.  It should be considered a political screed as much or more than it is a typical history book.,Howard Zinn lived from 1922 till 2010, meaning that his life encompassed nearly a quarter of all American history. In short, this history is Zinn‚Äôs attempt to explain the economic forces that have influenced American politics since before the founding of this country and that still exist today in more subtle forms. The book‚Äôs central thesis is that most (if not all) American wars were fought not in the name of democracy, but in order to achieve American economic dominance abroad and at home. Zinn‚Äôs history is unapologetically socialist, but his research and arguments are strong enough to survive any discrediting claims of bias on his part. Agree or disagree with Zinn, the ideas in this book are well worth the thought and consideration asked for.,As for the narration, this audiobook is read by Howard Zinn‚Äôs son, Jeff Zinn. Jeff is very clear, but also a bit dry at times. Still, the respect and passion he has for his father‚Äôs legacy shines through. Highly recommended.,Well written and narrated. Tough going though and quiet depressing throughout. Should be called tales of misery of the United States,I would recommend this history book, this is the version of you hardly ever hear about. The history of struggle of people at the bottom of society.,A really great book. Fascinating peformance.,Sometimes the audio had minor editing problems. Must read.,i highly recommend this book for students of history.,an honest history of united states.,This book is a must read/listen for anyone who wishes to look beyond the white veil of American history. A retelling of the country‚Äôs history taken from the viewpoint of those unlucky to be on the side of wealth and power. It is an incredibly important book that has at many times horrified and inspired me. Brilliantly researched and written, while also accessible to both occasional readers and academics.,Audio levels change throughout. Reader sounds like it's the first time they read the material.,This book should be on everyone‚Äôs reading list , people both inside and outside the US. The reason for this statement will become evident in the course of reading this masterpiece. To the critics, to err on the side of humanity is no error at all."

The cast is phenomenal and they do an exceptional job with the entire performance.,This book has everything you could want in a story: love, hatred, sex, forgiveness, female empowerment, humor, more sex, suspense...pretty much everything.

And even knowing the book as a reread, I felt her feelings harder than the first. But the VA‚Äôs who play our favorite characters really nail it all! I absolutely adored this version. I love the original narrator, but this just really did it for me.,I‚Äôve never listened to graphic audio but I was so captured I couldn‚Äôt stop listening I was right there in the story and those last two hours I held my breath it felt so real and so much action and drama. This is my now second favorite book in the ACOTAR series and I thought Nesta would never redeem herself but she did. Absolutely loved it!,Wow!  I absolutely loved this story AND series!!  The narrators for this graphic audiobook did a perfect job!!  The entire series is amazing, however, this book was so great.  The characters were relatable and I was so drawn into the story I was yelling at the story during some parts and honesty weeping during other parts.

Outlive,"Aging & Longevity,Personal Development,Anatomy & Physiology,Science Art Longevity",Health & Wellness,"Unfortunately, there is a great four-hour audiobook buried in 17 hours of filler, repetition, obvious illustrations, obscure medical detail, and irrelevant side stories. I got tired of fast forwarding through the audiobook and bought the Kindle edition so I could skim and focus on the valuable parts - which are truly valuable.,Unexpectedly honest & helpful. Attia left his ego out of this book. In so many longevity books, the author's ego takes the lead. Attia's taken the stance that people are individuals, and they need individual based foods and strategies, not a one size fits all diet or a dogmatic trip guide.,He makes no apologies for not endorsing  a particular diet - even the Mediterranean diet. He explains why many studies are misleading. He takes on emotional health for longevity and does a tremendous job with it.,I've just finished listening to the book, and there is so much packed on every page that my head is spinning. I'm going to return to it a second time after a break. I can't take all of it in in one listen. It makes it difficult  to review adequately.,For people who are deep into longevity seeking, it's going to be life-changing. For those who are starting out, it is pretty challenging but no less helpful. He doesn't fill the pages with recommendations for supplements.,I find it difficult to pigeonhole this book. I can say it is a pivot from the centuries old approach to medicine. It pivots from medicine 2.0 to medicine 3.0. It's where we are headed not where we've been.,He easily put himself in my shoes and understood what I'm looking for at 76. He clarified the path going forward that I'll need to stay functional and happy. His patients must feel very lucky to have him as a doctor.,I am a Peter Attia fan and listen to his podcast, but found this book painful. There are few actual tips on living better/longer until the very end. But, even after skipping many excruciatingly long chapters, those few tips are intertwined with so much science gobbledygook, it makes the book insufferable. In the beginning, he states he is not a researcher, but rather looks at himself as a translator of the science to normal folk. He says he should be graded on how well he accomplishes that. Using his own scoring system, it's a clear F.,This book has scared me into exercise, I hate exercise. Fantastic book!   Please keep writing.,It was a nice high level of stuff Peter has been saying for years but I've heard all of this on The Drive at some point. Didn't really get anything by listening this, as a result.,Outstanding book from an amazing human. Dr. Attia lays out how to optimize health and performance, as well as how to manage mental and emotional stress. I have been looking forward to this book as I have been an avid listener of his podcast for years.  Thank you Dr. Attia, for everything.,Dr. Peter hits this one out of the park!  A great, deep dive, abundance, but not exhaustive review of current and latest in longevity. Strong work‚Ä¶ I would put Easter island on my bucket list after this one ‚Äì Dr. Mark Bishara,Must read.

Elon Musk,"Business,Science & Technology,History",Biographies & Memoirs,"Some fascinating scenes and intense reporting. But overall, it seems that this billionaire believes in his own myth more than the humanity he purports to seek to ""save."" Also, telling your child that he's going to live on Mars is kinda sweet, kinda crazy, but when your name is X, maybe it' just part of the schtick.,,As for Jeremy Bobb's narration: it's fine, but he doesn't attempt to differentiate different characters/voices and at times it was unclear who was speaking since the attribution was not always immediate. Not that he should have tried to sound like Elon, but being able to tell when Walter is asking a question or it's another person responding would have been ideal.,Only the most devoted sycophants could find this interesting. It‚Äôs mostly a reminder that many geniuses of their times are hopelessly incomplete human beings. The similarities with Steve Jobs are striking. Lack of empathy seems to be the most common denominator. That‚Äôs something Musk fans should consider before trying to emulate his approaches. Absent his brilliance he was a jerk and since very few have his intellectual capacity many are destined to lose in all possible ways. I‚Äôm also struck by how his early years were so determinative despite his legendary intellect- nurture always wins‚Ä¶,The Walter bio format is tired. I think we were all hoping for glimpses of magic and inspiration but it‚Äôs just Elon‚Äôs Wikipedia page.,No new info if you keep up on Musk/news. Great story but author added nothing.,Musk didn‚Äôt even read this one before allowing it published‚Ä¶ With the Vance book, he wrote a novel worth of revisions/cliff notes.,Walter Isaacson has once again provided a deep unapologetic yet empathetic and unbiased view of an iconic person. The audio book is very well read and the book flows in a very matter of fact way similar to the Steve Jobs biography. Highly recommended.,Contains a very clear picture of who Elon Musk is, and how he got there. It doesn‚Äôt sugar coat it and tells all sides of the various stories. The reader is excellent. I believe that Musk may end up being one of the most important people the world has ever seen, but he is flawed like most great men that allow people to see behind the curtain, it‚Äôs an excellent listen I would highly recommend,For better or worse, Elon Musk is a simultaneously a really shitty person and an amazing human being, desperately striving to push the human race forward at any cost.,,We‚Äôll written with deep insights into arguably the most interesting man of our time. Only Musk would allow a biographer this degree of access and freedom to draw such a raw and real biographical portrait,Walter ends the book so we‚Äôll. Elon is broken, but he is trying to do good. And this book was eye opening to the demons that he is fighting and the battles he‚Äôs waging.,Overall it was a very good book. It will be interesting to see what the future holds.,I finished this book in less than 20 hours while working today. So if that tells you anything. It was well worth the read,It‚Äôs Elon, what else needs to be said?,,,,Review of Walter:,,First, Walter has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about with the technical stuff, this isn‚Äôt a huge deal, just annoying when it comes up.,,Much of the info is also not new/more detailed if you‚Äôve seen many interviews on YouTube, just more organized. But I guess that‚Äôs the value of the book, making already available information more accessible to those that weren‚Äôt interested in keeping up with Musk stuff. Still I wonder, where is the 2 years worth of insights? Book is too short for a man like Elon imo.,,Near the end of the book, Isaacson clings hard to this Demon Mode description of Musk and selectively portrays him as such with examples. Consequently, there‚Äôs way too many pages on twitter (1/5 of the book is twitter, while spanning less than a year in musk‚Äôs life. Perhaps Isaacson likes drama more than Elon). Just because twitter had more ‚Äúdemon mode‚Äù moments. First hand information isn‚Äôt always better than secondhand. Just because you witnessed twitter doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs important enough to replace early spaceX and Tesla as 20% of the whole book.,,Still, the value of this book is high.,,,Nitpicks:,,(AI argument is not clear, to those unfamiliar, it will sound like doomsday bs in the book. Also consciousness is not a necessary condition for super intelligence, so the ‚Äúdescendent‚Äù argument by Page is very weak.),,,(Early SpaceX was rushed, should have mentioned that sea salt corrosion and the pressurization incident were anticipated and prepared for, these mistakes were portrayed as much more idiotic than in actuality.)"
Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Animals,Literary Fiction,Mystery",Literature & Fiction,"So yup, I searched for Marin Ireland narration (because I'd listen to the dictionary if she were reading it) and found this great little story. I never would have found this book, or likely given it a chance if not for my loyalty to Marin. I LOVED this quirky, story where someone finally gives octopi the respect the deserve for their intelligence. Michael Urie made his character come alive with wit and personality which is saying something. Give this a shot... This book was wonderful.,Remarkably Bright Creatures is one of the most enjoy books I‚Äôve listened to in a long, long time.   Terrific story, thoroughly engaging characters, and two of the best narrators I‚Äôve ever heard.,With Marcellus, of course. Perhaps my most favorite literary character ever!  If I could give the narrators of this little gem of a book 10 stars, I would. Thank you Shelby Van Pelt for your vivid imagination and for teaching me about these extraordinary creatures of the sea., as well as the complexities of human nature.,Excellent story. Excellent characters. Excellent Narration. I double checked the author shortly after starting this book because the writing had a Fredrick Backman feel to it. I also recognized the narrator as the same one who narrates the Backman novels. I loved this as much as my favorite Backman novels. Downside: this has left me with a serious book-hangover.,I haven't read fiction in a while, I mainly listen to history or memoirs. I am very glad I got to hear this story and I really enjoyed it. It is simple but made me feel nice and I needed that right now. I hope you enjoy it too.,Pure delight! I laughed out loud, I cried a little, I thought hard. Great characters - big love for Marcellus and an increasing appreciation for octopuses. Some of the best hours of words in my head‚Ä¶,Absolutely wonderful! The narrators are fantastic, the story is engaging and it is impossible not to fall in love with the cast of characters.,An unusual, quirky, heartwarming tale that kept me listening. The octopus had me at hello.,I have a soft spot for cephalopods so I am not surprised that I like this book. Of course, Marcellus is my favorite character. There were more than a few times I thought I was going to not like some of the other characters but they all redeemed themselves rather quickly each time. Some of the overall plot was predictable but that was okay because the details were the fun part. This is a book I can reread.,Not what I expected.  I don't care about one single character except the octopus and his chapters are too few and far between and less then one minute. Will send it back to Audible 1/3 through. Did NOT hold my interest at all.,Ended up finishing 1 wk later.,Again, the octopus was the saving grace!  I'll never forget him, though Tova WAS cool.  why they insisted on  making her say things like "" good heavens""! or ""my word""! is ridiculous.  No 70 yr old woman talks like that anymore.  Lots of extraneous verbiage but all in all it was an exceptional and quite enjoyable idea for a novel.  I'm glad I finished it."
The Armor of Light,Historical Fiction,Literature & Fiction,"Ken Follett is my favorite author. For my money, Column of Fire might be the greatest historical fiction of all time, tied with Pillars of the Earth.  When he comes out with a new book, I set my calendar, and read it the first day. This book is good, but I never felt myself gripped to the stories nor the characters in the same way I do with  Pillars, nor Column, and I‚Äôll explain why.,** mild spoilers upcoming, I‚Äôm not gonna give away everything, but some might choose to stop reading here***,This book is a slow build. When I looked at the time period I thought the novel was going to be all about Napoleon, with characters who scheme with Wellington, and others who serve Napoleon, but Follett takes a different tack. He spends the bulk of the book describing how the home front is affected by distant wars. Inflation, bread shortages, bread riots, and the main theme of the book, Labor Unions in the UK. The war with Napoleon is mainly just a malaise that hangs over Kingsbridge, as you hear about headlines of Austerlitz, and the Grand Arme√® getting lost in Russia, but he doesn‚Äôt set the stage for any of those encounters, and no character ever sets eyes on Napoleon at any point in the book. Finally at Waterloo he puts the Kingsbridge characters in the muck, and his depiction of Waterloo was the highlight of the book.,He had similar themes in Pillars (distant war complicates building a Cathedral), but in Pillars I was gripped to  the villain (Hamley) and my wife and I decided we will  name our future daughter after Aliana (from Pillars). None of the protagonists nor antagonists captivated me in the same way previous Follett characters gripped me.,The main villain, the CEO of the weaving  conglomerate is some mix of Scrooge, and Javier (from Les Mis). I never really found myself hating the villain, just a greedy money hungry CEO, who will do anything to maintain his wealth at the top.,In most of Follett‚Äôs books he puts his characters right in the middle of the action (Think Ned Willard working as a spy for Elizabeth Tudor, or Prior Philip addressing King Stephen/Archbishop of Canterbury), no character exists like that in this novel. All major historical characters are mostly seen from afar, as the labor disputes in Kingsbridge take center stage for the entirety of the book.,Ultimately, I would‚Äôve loved a character who rubbed shoulders with Napoleon, and even a character that was closer with Wellington.,I still genuinely enjoyed this novel, but likely my least favorite of the Kingsbridge series, unfortunately.,How the mighty Ken Follett has fallen over these last several books; I continue to read them as they get ever more tedious and less ingenious. Save yourself the trouble of reading the armor of light, it has very little of the informative historical perspective that is the hallmark of pillars of the earth. Plenty of social justice preaching though, and demonizing the productive.,Please do not waste your money on this book like I did imagining it would be even remotely similar to the other books in the pillars of the earth series. I actually loved the last one which was a prequel and figured follet would put just as much work into this one especially since it‚Äôs supposed to be the final for the series. I could not have been more wrong. The characters are completely dull with strange names and the book seems to be written as if for a child (writing style). Have to quickly rant about this as I feel Follet just spewed this out knowing people would buy and preorder. Feel scammed tbh this book is abysmal! What could be more boring than endless pages about sewing and interest rates and loans.,Pillars of the Earth and World Without End are two of my favourites books and I have loved the others in the series as well, but this one just doesn't measure up. Part of what I love about Pillars and World is Follett's detailed description of how the cathedral was built, followed closely by his attention to other historical details. This latest book is set in the more recent past - late 1700 and early 1800s. While the details about the effects of industrialization where still interesting, they didn't hold the same appeal as earlier periods did for me.,,Without the same interest in setting, I was left with the actual plot - the characters and their development - and that bordered on boring. Follett's bad guys are all the same - consistently and irrationally cruel. His good guys have a little more depth, but generally in Follett's worlds, you are either bad or good without much nuance, and the good guys keep trying to do good while the bad guys, who are inevitably rich and powerful when the book opens, thwart them just because they can. Good guys do have weaknesses, like alcohol or gambling, but those are mostly used to move the plot forward. Oh, and one of the good guys will always fall for the pretty, shallow girl at first, failing to see what a treasure the the less beautiful but good and kind woman woman who loves him is. Been there, done all that. Most of the characters in this book could have been swapped out for very similar characters in other books.,,One thing I did notice was that there were finally gay characters. I don't remember that before. However (minor spoiler coming up......) the complete acceptance they experience from loved ones, and many others as well, rings completely false, as lovely as it would have been.,,It's still an okay read and probably worth it if you are a big fan of the series, but temper your expectations.,I wondered often if it was just AI. Had Follets formula but no heart. Didn‚Äôt care about the characters,This was a great book, very on point with things happening today. Corrupt government. People who lack and people who have abundance. People trying to cling to what has been and people trying to change to bigger and faster ways.,You could read this book without ever having read any of the other Kingsbridge books. Kingsbridge, the place, was a focal point in the other books, in this book it was barely a background.,When they spoke of Parliament, I kept expecting Eth Leckwith to say or do something.,My only negative feeling about the book is... it lacked the amazing intimate relationships between characters and the characters and myself, the reader.,There was very little 'adult intimacy' in this book, which is a part of what I have always loved about a Ken Follet book.,I also didn't fall in love or hate with 1 single character either. That was disappointing, but I will listen to this book again in the next year or so.,The next book would be 200 years from this one, if history repeats itself again, and that would bring us to the time of now. Could that be a possibility? Or just jump ahead 400 years and create a future Kingsbridge. A utopia we have all dreamed of.,I am very excited John Lee was the narrator! He was amazing, as always!,Thank you Ken Follet for being a part of my life for over 30 years. Your books have definitely had influence in my life! Thank you for being an amazing author and human!,,Great history lesson not much of a story ‚ùìneeded more about the people and their history,I was really excited when I saw this announced for pre-order. I even re-listened to Evening and Pillars -- and started on Column of Fire, but stopped to start The Armor.,,So disappointed -- none of the characters hold the same sway as the ones in Pillars. The formula on the characters in all the books is the exact same. Such a shame -- but I guess this series by Ken Follett is a one-trick pony.,,I was initially excited to hear about details about the spinning and weaving industrialization, as I'm a wool merchant myself. However, the book just didn't come together for me despite that.,,Spoiler:,Having half of Kingsbridge end up at the Battle of Waterloo was so unreal -- as was the characters ""running into each other by chance"" ...,,Pillars of the Earth was a once in a life-time read. Should have left it at that.,The villains in Follets book are so simplistically evil. They never do good but ludicrously try to find evil to perpetuate. I‚Äôm surprised they have time for a life when not drowning puppies and burning orphans at the stake. Meanwhile, the rest of the town is so naive as to be unbelievable.,Regret wasting my time and credit on this book.  Seems like it was autogenerated by an AI"
The Hobbit,"Classics,Literary Fiction,Fantasy",Literature & Fiction,"I want to thank Andy Serkis for his magnificent performance of The Hobbit. I was transported to Middle Earth and lived each adventure through his narration.,,Mr. Serkis has such an outstanding range of voices that you knew each character at once. His interpretation of Gandalf, Thorin, Balin, Dwalin and the others gave the book a richness I didn't feel before. And of course, we can't forget his perfect performance of Gollum.,,I will be listening to this again and again.,I don‚Äôt even need to finish this to give it 5 stars. Andy Serkis is AMAZING, but that wasn‚Äôt ever really in question. What I love is that he really acts out the actions. Like he put his heart into‚Äîwhich, again, isn‚Äôt surprising. We need the whole trilogy from him. Not that I don‚Äôt love the originals, but this is just wonderful. I loved loved loved it.,I‚Äôm not going to bother reviewing the book itself as it‚Äôs the same fantastic book it‚Äôs always been. But I will praise the narration by Andy Serkis. It is superior to the original narration by Rob Inglis in every way, and I sincerely hope that the powers that be have Mr. Serkis record The Lord of the Rings trilogy next. PLEASE.,This is best audiobook performance I have ever heard. I missed half of the live quarantine performance by Serkis and was delighted when I heard that it would be released on audible. There is nothing I would change about the reading. Heads up to those who seek a bedtime read, go with the older narration. Serkis narration is so lively and vivid that it can jolt you awake. You‚Äôd be a fool not to get this rendition, y‚Äôall.,The only thing that could have made this better would be if it was completely read in Gollum's voice,If you enjoy the Peter Jackson films or Tolkien in general, you'll love this narration. Andy Serkis's acting talent is on full display as he transports listeners to Middle Earth. The song melodies sound much like their film versions, and character voices are rich and varied, with accents and tones that convey not just Andy's own iconic Gollum, but also Richard Armitage's Thorin and Ken Stott's Balin, for instance. This version is vastly superior to Rob Inglis's in every way and has become the definitive Hobbit audiobook in my mind. Bring on LOTR, Andy!,One of my favorite books of all time! and this is by far the best narrator! I really hope to see the whole series read by Andy Serkis.,I pre-ordered this for LITERALLY one chapter: Riddles In The Dark.  I am HAPPILY listening to the entire story.  I don't know what I expected, but it was NOT this.  This is infinitely better than I could have ever hoped.  It's near perfect.  I absolutely love it, and I'm only to chapter six...,Serkis‚Äôs performance is absolutely phenomenal. This version of The Hobbit is also very clear and clean versus the older audiobook recordings. These books were due for a much needed update and Serkis delivered handsomely. Please please please please do LoTR!!!!,Andy Serkis doing Riddles in the Dark is Transcendant, and his voice acting on all of the other voices also blows my mind."

Someone who never backs down, never shows fear, has unshakable will and drive. The next chapter he is crying about how scared he is. How he is full of dread and despair. How he can't stand up to what ever problem he is facing and how unfair it all is. If you want to write a strong MC with and indomitable will take some notes from the Primal Hunter series MC, cause that is how you do it.,,This has been great story so far. Can‚Äôt wait the next.

Deffinitly worth a listen. highly recommended by me with over 300+ books.,So damn good. Really good story even with the slow start on book 1. Book 2 pulls your focus in and holds it, doesn‚Äôt seem to let you slip at all and I can not wait for book 3!,I love this series. It has all the action and character building neatly put together even with how fast he needs to power up it doesn‚Äôt seem super rushed.

I have no much good to say about this book.,The book has like like a dark romance version of a meet cute. The fmc is stuck in cage with a guy she just murdered when the mmc rescues her. and he knew of her ‚Äúwork‚Äù.  That when I knew it was going to be GOOD.,This book was the best blend of a romcom and a dark romance. The flirty/funny banter but still have it be dark? I was devouring it.,The plot was so fun. An annual murd‚Ç¨r competition? And whoever kills the right guy first wins? That‚Äôs so fun. (I don‚Äôt know what that says about me that that is my first thought),THE FMC HAS PIERCINGS. IN BOTH PLACES üëÄ I just felt like that needed to be said in the review. That is all.,READ IT.,Joe Arden and Lucy Rivers do a very good job of narrating this book. They have good chemistry and the style was unique in a good way. The story though? eh. Some of it was interesting but parts of it just literally did not seem feasible and others were so clich√© it hurts. There were multiple parts where I bet myself one of them would say something and about 80% of those bets I was correct word for word. It wasn't a bad book, but I am not sure if its worth all the hype the booktok girlies gave it.,This is probably the second review I have ever done. This book, this author, these performers are amazing. Definitely not for the squeamish, but it is brilliant and clever, and just beyond anything!,Read it if you dare, but you will be so happy you did!,I have listened to many audiobooks but I can honestly say this is the best narration in any book I have listened to. The story is also compelling since I never thought I would like 2 serial killers. Definitely worth the credit.,This is 100 percent what I have been looking for when looking for audio books for ""dual POV"".  When each line is ACTUALLY read by each voice narrator's voice within the story, not just a specific chapter or two.  This was EXCEPTIONAL.  Joe Arden obviously is the GOAT when it comes to romance and Lucy Rivers had the perfect amount of sass.  This was such an enjoyable listen and I actually bought the paperback just so I can read along with it because it was so vivid in my mind!,loved this!!! audible only made the whole book come to life. I have never been grossed out, giddy, laughing, crying, spicy, and enthralled all at one time. voice actors amazing and writing fantastic!!,I really liked this book and heard good things about the audiobook. Unfortunately the sound effects didn't do it for me, There is a part where the male narrator is retching -- and not like once or twice -- this is multiple times. I just couldn't. I found the sound effects really distracting, like a tv was on in the other room. The female narrator was great and the story was great.,The narration was great, the plot,wasn‚Äôt.  It was unrealistic , the plot could have been much more interesting and showed more depth with the same framework.  Didn‚Äôt bother finishing it.,The narration was incredible! I think almost any audio book would benefit from being read like this, it was really engaging!,,The book itself was very juvenile. There were overarching adult themes but it felt like if a child was trying to be edgy. I thought it was really poorly thought out. If you're going to write a book where the main plot is driven by 2 people getting away with murder FOR YEARS, maybe put a little thought into how they actually do that. At one point they leave a living witness in a shirt covered in the FMC's DNA.,Love everything about this audiobook! The story was engaging, and I absolutely loved the dual narration. It really adds something extra to the experience having the actors read their parts in each chapter.,Joe Arden! ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è This talented voice actor has the hearts of 10s of thousands with his wonderful and funny performance in this book alone. I cackled and laughed through majority of the book. It's funny,it's spicy and it's a pure delight.,Great narration, great story line and love the comedy side too! Highly recommend! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,Such a heart warming and funny read... considering it's about serial killers lol. It's that sinking feeling when a book ends that you know it's been a good one üëç,I have never read a book like this before and it was so refreshing, who knew mixing Dark Romance & the usual RomCom would work so well?! I loved every single second of this book, the writing was SO entertaining and Joe & Lucy's performances just brought that to life in the best way. I cannot wait for book 2 of this series.,This is by far the best audio book I‚Äôve listened to. And I‚Äôve listened to lots! The story and the performance is just amazing. Don‚Äôt delay, start listening today! üôÉ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§,Truly riveting. Fantastic narration. Unusual concept really well done. I will definitely read it again. Thank You to Brynne and Joe and Lucy.,This book has been my obsession. The actors that voiced this book were fantastic!

And the audiobook performance is unmatched, what a masterpiece.,Admittedly, the trigger warnings had me concerned that I‚Äôd just downloaded yet another Wattpad level writing bit of booktok nonsense but from chapter 1 it was obvious I was entirely wrong. The writing was cheeky yet grounded and the build up perfection.

The narrators are both incredible Joe Arden‚Äôs slight Irish accent was an incredible touch 10/10 my new favourite book of all time!,The narrators were amazing. I finished this within 2 days I was so hooked. They brought the story to life and made it feel like I was there. So real. Brilliant book. Loved the storyline,Great story, made even better by the narrators. I don't always like it when narrators sigh or huff, but I loved this, it really added to the banter between the characters.,I loved chapter 8 and the subsequent chapters when Rowan sends her ingredients and gives her cooking lessons over the phone, it really added to this amazing love story!,amazing! the banter,  the chemistry,  hands down the best audiobook I've ever listened to!,the amount of times i laughed out loud or teared up, this book was so incredibly well written,  I can't wait for the next in the series!,This was one of the BEST Audiobooks I have ever listened to. I have not stopped talking about this book and cannot recommend it enough if you love a dark romance that makes you laugh!,Joe and Lucy were fantastic and I didn‚Äôt want it to end! I cannot wait for Brynne to release the next one!!,Loved this from start to finish. Funny, sweet, raunchy, dark, it had it all. Highly recommend.,Loved the story and the performance. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book of the series!,I finished this within 24 hours of purchase! This was my first Audio book, my first book I've read or listen to in 4 years since having kids and what a story it was! This blew me away.

Beautiful Chains,"Action & Adventure,Contemporary,Romantic Suspense",Romance,"This story so didn‚Äôt go where I thought!  I am really hoping for a HEA!  I need book 3!  üò≠. I hope book 3 shows interaction between her brothers and Alexei.  Hoping they get along once they see how much he really loves her.  Would be awesome to see Chloe and Slava too!!  Loved it!!  But as always I want more!!,Audiobook:  Narrators - C.J. Bloom and Ryan West,,Oh my gosh!  Ryan West was amazing!!!  This is my first time listening to him and from his first words I was a goner.  He was perfect as Alexei.  This wasn‚Äôt just a narration, this was two narrators giving life and portraying it through their voices.  It was awesome and I loved every moment of their performances.,,,Wow! I didn‚Äôt see this coming, at all!,,All of Alexei‚Äôs machinations have finally paid off and he has Alina where he wants her.  Except she isn‚Äôt giving in completely.  While the chemistry between them controls much of their reactions, outside that she is standing strong against Alexei‚Äôs plans.  At least she‚Äôs trying to.,,I love Alexei in all his alpha glory.  He‚Äôs an anti-hero that has kept me guessing up to this point.  Beautiful Chains gives us his point of view and holy heck was it delicious.  He‚Äôs determined to have Alina and all that goes along with that.,,This has a huge cliffhanger and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to be able to wait until the next book is released.,,I am loving this series. But man did my heart break! These two have not had it easy as children or adults and their choices aren‚Äôt making it any easier. The only thing that seems easy is their connection in passion. But post-passion, they are back to their destructive selves.  The last few chapters grabbed hold of my heart and ripped it to shreds.,I need more!,Great narration.,I thought book 1 was one steamy read but this second installment was even more so. I equally hate and love Alexei‚Äôs ruthless and obsessive ways but I could also understand his motivations. Alina was annoying at times but okay, I do understand her struggles. I wrongly thought I was reading a typical Anna Zaire‚Äôs dark romance and boy was I wrong. The story took another dark turn which I did not see coming at all and then it ended on a cliffhanger. Gah!,CJ Bloom is back as Alina. She performed her parts flawlessly. Unlike book 1, we get Alexei‚Äôs POV in this book and Ryan West did great. Before this, I haven‚Äôt listened to much of his narration but I‚Äôm gonna be looking out for more books narrated by him.,Well, that was a plot twist I didn‚Äôt see coming. It‚Äôs nice the author revealed what causes Alina‚Äôs headaches.  My heart was constantly pounding every time Alexei expressed his feelings/obsession about her, only to find out his time with her maybe limited or cut short. I think I now have anxiety just from having wait for book 3.  It will be nice to hear more about the Molotov family after they have been informed of Alina‚Äôs condition and what did Alexei‚Äôs father did to his sister.  Great book, worth the wait but wish it was longer.,I loved this book, I had already guessed what was causing her headaches but what I did not see coming another cliffhanger ugh. I just hope we don't have to wait another year for the next book. Also I loved the performance.,This is the second book in the Molotov Betrothal series, a Mafia Romance.  I like this series! Alina and Alexei's story continue where the first book left off.   The storyline is captivating, filled with angst, and twists and turns.  The story ends with a big cliffhanger, and I am looking forward to listening to the next book in the series.  CJ Bloom and Ryan West did an excellent job bringing these characters, and this story to life.,I listened to book one last year and I‚Äôll be honest I forgot some details so I had to go back and refresh. I wasn‚Äôt aware it was a trilogy and this is another cliffhanger ending so be prepared. Also I didn‚Äôt find any of the content triggering but do your own research.,My favorite parts were getting a peek into Alexei‚Äôs childhood. While it wasn‚Äôt good and my heart hurt for him it explains a lot about why he is the way he is. I understand him a bit better and it made want Alina to stop fighting him so hard. For me because of the way Alina kept him at a distance and because of the ending it left me wanting. I needed to have some sweet moments between the two and not all gloom and doom. I just hope the next book comes out soon and that there is an HEA. I think they both deserve it.,Narration was really good!,I loved this book, it was definitely a great read. Love Anna Zaire‚Äôs books, can‚Äôt wait for the conclusion!!,,My only complaint is that it‚Äôs not longer and I‚Äôll need to wait another year for the final book.,Alexi and Alina has my heart üíú,Loved the second book but please don‚Äôt make us wait so long for the next one,Even though it‚Äôs a shorter book. Found the start of book slow going. But really enjoyed the twisted end. Looking forward to book 3."
Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself,"Personal Success,New Thought,Energy Work","Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","Two books down in 2 months. Read a lot of disappointing reviews, but found they didn't reflect the book. It appears to me, those same negative reviews come from individuals who likely aren't able to apply what they've read...either from this book or others authored by Dr. Dispenza. Feeding the old self, rather than applying the material earnestly and creating the 2.0 version. If you're analyzing and judging the material, he's already called you out for deferring to the analytical self...which is not the message of these books! Some reviews gave mediocre ratings because it's a lot of the same material from his other books and that it is. However, did you ever perfect a process the first time around? Or did you need to repeat, review, and implement many times over before you felt it was right? Habits are built through repetition and he urges readers to wash, rinse, and repeat; yet some refuse to do this and then criticize the process and his books because they only saw the results that I had already determined to be the outcome in their minds. I'm seeing changes, unquestionably. Good luck to those that follow!!!,I bought this after reading the book so I could have an audio version of the step by step, guided meditations included in the appendix of the book. These were not included!  How could they have left out that part?! Also, the narrator was not my style. Slow talker and had a bit of a snarky tone.,Where are the narration of the guided meditations?,We buy a audio to have ALL THE BOOK in audio.,The most important parts, the exercises, were not narrated.,The appendixes are part of the book, for god sake. Why did you not narrate them?,I was looking forward to this book. but even five minutes and I knew I couldn't enjoy it because of the person reading it. I am so very disappointed. I love dr. Joe dispenza and all of his work but I just can't abide this,After listening to the entire book and practicing Dr. Joe‚Äôs meditation,  I noticed a difference in my thoughts and behaviors after the first meditation. There are several events that happened in my life which seem miraculous that I now understand I brought them to fruition through my thoughts and unwavering belief in what the outcome would be.,This is pseudoscience and scam! Not practical and completely useless. Reading it is a waste of time.,Overall, if you have been in this space and are familiar with self growth, there is nothing new and it‚Äôs packaged with his variations that you could probably pick up on YouTube as well. Little bit longer than is necessary and some chapters but someone new, it may be more enjoyable.,I heard glowing reviews from several sources regarding this book, and was optimistic that I could learn some scientific reasons to motivate me towards a better self, and breaking some bad habits.,Most of all I heard promise of it‚Äôs strong persuasive reasoning to get me to meditate in a more dedicated fashion.,I did not find any of that. Instead I regret my purchase, and wished I had more thoroughly investigated this ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù and ‚Äúneuroscientist‚Äù (he‚Äôs a chiropractor, and has no specific degree that he would share with anyone about how he is a neuroscientist),Basically Dispenza wastes much of your time explaining quantum physics incorrectly and then fictionally ‚Äúreasons‚Äù some great mysteries of quantum physics away, with no evidence or reason at all. He‚Äôs hoping that he has beaten you into such a stupor regarding the average persons understanding that he can then slip this past you. He built on this fiction by then claiming that your strong thoughts and prayers can not only effect yourself and others, but even past and future events. To be clear, I do think that thoughts and desires can effect our own minds and bodies, that‚Äôs pretty much what self improvement or even self destruction are, but it won‚Äôt change things outside yourself (and even changing yourself is very hard, hence this entire genre).,If you think crystals can heal your body, don‚Äôt believe you need vaccines or other modern medicine because the body can perfectly protect and heal itself, or decide who you date or befriend based on their zodiac signs then by all means pick this book up. It will certainly charm you with large words your not familiar with, then make fictional claims that the cosmos will allow you to wish things into existence, which will help confirm those prior, incorrect biases.,As for me, I have wished and prayed harder than ever before in my life that I had never listed or paid for this trash, but alas this book belongs in the fiction category. The best I can wish for is to warn others.,This book could benefit from at least 100 pages removed which would probably make the audio book 2-3 hours less. The author is busy showing off his knowledge and this causes the reader(listener) to have to SWIM through the information to find the needed text to actually help you break the habit of being yourself. I found it beneficial to get a copy of the book verses listening only.,A friend recommended this book to me and I‚Äôm so glad I read it! It‚Äôs insightful on how we do have control Over our thoughts. I recommend it to anyone on a self discovery journey or just trying to be a better human. The only thing I wish was different is if I could see all the diagrams he refers to as he‚Äôs reading.,I bought this book after listening to Dr. Dispenza do an interview about meditation practices. I REALLY liked the way he described changing the present you and taking control of your thoughts to create the life you envision. I've heard many different people tackle this idea, and in that interview he nailed it for me. Additionally, the audio quality and reading of this book are great.,,That being said, I couldn't make it through more than the first hour of this book. I wish that Dr Dispenza didn't try to ""prove"" everything by claiming it is scientific and related to the quantum realm. The world's leading scientists in quantum mechanics all seem to agree that we barely understand anything about it, and yet Dr Dispenza writes as though he has mastery over it, and that we can learn how to master it too. It seems to be an argument from ignorance, whereby he has taken the correlation of certain outcomes and their connection with people believing they can influence the quantum realm, and decided this is evidence enough that the quantum realm caused these outcomes. Correlation does not imply causation. With millions of people following his teachings, I can see how it would be easy to find a few cases that align by chance, thereby supporting his theory, and ignore the much larger majority that don't fit the narrative.,,I can't give this book one star, because I truly believe that many of the principles and ideals of this book can be life changing, and that the overall story being told is incredibly useful. However, I wish he didn't feel the need to package everything up using quantum science - it is like he has searched for something that we cannot yet explain or understand, and used it as if it were unequivocal evidence of the ideas he champions. Of course we can't prove him wrong - we don't fully understand it either - but I wish he would be transparent enough to admit that he doesn't either. The teachings in his books are enough on their own, they would still be just as fantastic without their quantum science explanation.,,If you read this review and completely disagree with me, then this book will likely be great for you, and I think you will love it. If however, like me, you like the central themes of changing yourself and becoming a better version of yourself, but don't buy into the quantum science explanation, then this book is definitely not for you, and will be a wasted purchase.,This book helped me to become aware of automatic patterns of behaviour and negative thoughts that were holding me back.,I was then able to reprogram my mind and instead focus on how I want my life to be in the future.,You must be open minded and believe in the law of attraction / meditation / energy & Focus etc for this book to really impact you and change your life for the better. Dr Joe is an expert in the field.,one of the best if not the best things on sudio self development that I have bought, have not finished but it gets better the longer I listen to it, the ideas of how the mind works and how to change your mind and create a new one is simple and engaging, highly recommended,If you‚Äôre looking for cod mysticism wrapped up in pseudoscientific  gibberish, this is the book for you. Teeth started itching during the horribly overlong intro (apparently aimed at the level of a small but credulous child), but when he uses wave particle duality as evidence the we can master our futures and shape them exactly as we‚Äôd like, well, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all folks‚Äù as they used to say on Looney Toons‚Ä¶,this was recommended to me by my mentor  it's literally rewiring me, and creating a better version of my true self without all the triggers & ego expression.,I have read loads of book on the law of attraction this by far is the best. If you struggle with abstract concepts and putting them into action this book will help. Truly life changing.,There's a few good ideas for meditation practices, somewhere in there, but so much of this book is fluff and nonsense. That's just not how ""quantum"" or genes work.,If you got it, skip directly to section 3, and go fast,If you want to know how the brain works then it‚Äôs fine. But this book is tedious and takes hours to get to the point.,This book is something else, wonderfully and logically laid out going into the science of quantum mechanics, to the science of the body and chemistry of the mind and how the environment, body and mind all exist in relation to eachother. Stringing together this information in this way will help you become the true self you've always known yourself to be.,I‚Äôm pissed off with this book because the content is fabulous but the narrating voice is so off putting and monotone , it sounds like a robot from the 1990s. A waste of money I‚Äôm going to buy this on kindle and read it because the audio is shocking.,1 of the 3 only books you‚Äôll ever need, in order to reclaim, maintain, and change your entire life,Just finished going through it. Now ready for round 2. One of the best scientific breakdowns of the mystical LOA.,It gave me goosebumps while listening it and form of energy. Will listen to it couple of times for sure!,Great book that really helps you change the way you think. It would have been good to have more tips on how to put the suggestions into practice.,I am happy that people like him express what I've  believed for a very long time.,he explains it and backs it up with science and physics.,a must for everyone,totally changed my life,the learning, the facts, the change, the calm,live in the energy of your future,The narration is a bit too fast, need more time to digest concepts and ideas.,Great book but the voice is boring, it would be so much better if read by Joe Dispenza himself.,I have read the book and now listening to the audiobook, the narrator makes the work enjoyable, bringing a touch of humour to some of the stories.,The stories themselves, some of them seem unreal, even laughable (the wart story) but the information from Dispenza is helpful. You will have to actually do the work though as you‚Äôll find yourself falling back into your regular habits soon enough - so do the work!,If you‚Äôre looking for the meditations though, you will have to record them yourself or buy them from Joe‚Äôs website :/,as soon as he mentioned he was a chiropractor I new this would not be science !"

The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King,"Fantasy,Paranormal,Action & Adventure",Romance,"I stumbled upon these books at a very fortunate time. The second one had just released two days prior to me starting the first one and let me tell you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not much for reading books or listening to books. I just recently got into it, but when I say this series completely and utterly trapped everything that I love in a story, this book gave me no room to breathe. Absolutely fantastic books and absolutely fantastic narration. I couldn‚Äôt be happier at the current moment. Money well spent!,Both of the narrators are so good! They do a wonderful job at feeling every word they say making every emotion so much more intense for the listener.,Much like the first book, I cried my way through the second. This is the only book that has ever made me cry out of sadness and joy.,I will probably be buying a hard copy just to go back and re read all my favorite parts :),,The narrators did a great job. They enhanced the story so perfectly. I enjoyed the story.,A+ story, A+ narrators, A+ audiobook!!  Another excellent audiobook from this amazing series!  Can't get enough of Amanda and Aiden!,I was really looking forward to this audiobook, though I did try to read the text version, I have to say there is just something to be said about how emotive and expressive these voice actors are. They really brought alive the characters. From Oraya's stubbornness and complicated feelings of all that occurred after the trials, to Rhain's struggle to rule in a castle that holds the worst of his nightmarish memories, the actors brought it all alive.,My favorite aspects of this sequel: (SPOILERS!!!!),‚ú®Ô∏è I have always hated the trope that once burned the heroine forgives the guy quickly and they live happily ever after. so this was refreshing. Oraya didn't forgive Rhain easily which results in top-tier groveling,‚ú®Ô∏è There may be a lot of political aspects in this world but it doesn't take away from the true nature of the vampires that inhabit it. One of the most interesting new characters for me was her cousin. Girl is loony üëÄ,‚ú®Ô∏è A lot of people may claim this to be a romance fantasy book but I'd have to say is very well distributed between actual plot and the romance of the two main characters. Yes there's spice (good spice I may add üëå) but there's also alot of emotional growth that's interspersed with action, gore, and adventure.,üö© One thing I just have to say is the male voice actor's pronunciation of certain words and names is inconsistent with the female narrator's. It didn't affect my listening experience but it just grated on me when I noticed.,,I loved reading this series. It had me invested from the beginning. I thought it was wonderfully written and really engaging. Definitely one of my top favs!,This is one of my favorite series that I‚Äôve read so far. I really hope there is more to come!!,After I listened to Book 1 on Audible, I lost my mind when I learned I had to wait for Book 2. So, I bought the book and spent two crazy days reading it. I wept so many times while reading Book 2. It was so moving. But, after listening to the audio version, I have determined that I love the book more. I think Amanda Leigh Cobb did an excellent job narrating both characters in Book 1 and she could have done the same in Book 2. I'm not a fan of switching or adding narrators in the middle of a series. It's just not right. Nonetheless, Aiden Snow did a fine job. I just think it would have been better with one narrator throughout. It also would have been nice if each narrator used the same pronunciations of names. Each narrator puts you in a different mood. I felt like I was forced to try to love two different Raihns. It was too much for my sweet little brain and heart!,Absolutely obsessed with this series. Characters are emotionally intelligent and deep. Story is perfection. Also SO creepy,So happy that this book didn‚Äôt suffer second book syndrome!!! This series is amazing! So exited for more !! Bravoüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª,the female narrator was brilliant as in the Ist book.  It took a while to get used to the new male narrator.  i loved the book it actually moved me to tears in some places but full of action. I just want more.,Narrators are great, story is wonderful.  But knowing there is more coming is not cool lol, I hate pacing my reads out.,I really enjoyed the first book. So many times I screamed in surprise, couldn‚Äôt sleep until I finished the next chapter. And the next.,This book is a disappointment. Almost everything is predictable apart from two details at the very end, which are still not answering all the questions and are not that very well thought through.,The first one is about how Oraya and Raihn unite the House of Night. But why would Oraya want that kind of connection with her FATHER in the first book? It‚Äôs portrayed way too sexual to be able to have that kind of connection with father. Furthermore, Nayaxia said: ‚Äúask another goddess‚Äù. That goddess then grants the wish Nayaxia wanted to grant herself, but couldn‚Äôt for some reason, and then says: ‚ÄúNayaxia will be furious at you later on‚Äù‚Ä¶ where is the logic?,The second detail is expanding more on the reasons behind Vincent‚Äôs decisions towards Oraya as his daughter and his love towards her. But why is he the only exception to how to treat his child? Any father truly loving his daughter or son would try to grow them into a decent human/vampire being. Vincent is the only decent father in the history of ‚Äúroyal‚Äù vampires who aims to achieve that? Please.,These are the only two confusing surprises. Everything else is so predicable.,Raihn and Oraya. She hates him for killing her father in the first book. She continues hating him half way through the second book. And then, surprise, she cannot hate him anymore! But why? Because of his toxic way of apologising to her. ‚ÄúPlease leave and create your own live, everything is ready for you to escape, but I love you very much and will not be able to live without you‚Äù. Oraya‚Äôs character obviously would not be able to leave after this. If he knew her so well, he would have known about that too. He so clearly manipulated her. I was disgusted listening to that part of the story.,She falls back in love with him. Protects him from the political outrage of royalty. Slave ruling the kingdom? Yes! Of course there would be an outrage, what would anyone else expect? War breaks out. Ok, fine, another detail I wouldn‚Äôt be able to predict is that her blood is somewhat important (but only due to Vincent‚Äôs secret discoveries that only her blood should unlock). She hence has protection and cannot die. Reign though is disposable and is constantly plotted against. She then has political power to save him just because she is untouchable and cannot die.,I also very much dislike that Raihn keeps dying (or gets close to the state of about to die) and Oraya keeps saving him. My idea of romance is where a lady is allowed to feel safe and protected. Here, it seems that Raihn is the lady who needs constant protection and Oraya is a man who is always there to save him.,I really dislike the book. But the performances were great and this is the only reason why I was able to finish the book.,,This did not captivate me like the first one did. it was ok, but I won't buy the next one if it comes along.,The male narrator kind of ruined it for me. did not fit to be a vampire I think. Wish the female read both part, she was wonderful and perfect for this book.,A good book, if a little predictable, left on an open ending ready for the next part of the series. I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs next,Becoming head of houses, king and queen Rahin and Oraya. Both figuring out how they are going to do this. Not trusting anyone from their house. A war coming can they deal with what's to come?,I loved this one more than i did the first one. There were plenty of emotions in this one. Oraya is not happy with what rahin did to her. This book is a bit of a rollercoaster. Oraya hates rahin to begin with but has things unravel thing change. Rahin is doing everything he can protect her from everything. Keeping enemies at bay from her. An till that one night she protects a saves him.,I loved they way this whole series has been written. I think it has great world build, slow burns, vampires, humans, and war. Lies and truth all mixed up. There's even some spice üå∂. Great mix and written to keep you wanting to know more.,If you've not read the do run to read.,great listening, too.,Everything about this is good. The writing, narrators,  story,  good smut without the cringy talks.,This picked up after the first. Obviously the story was built upon the events of the last book and included new characters and locations. I enjoyed the inclusion of Rhains point of view. I would of liked more daddy Vincent but his and Orayas mums back story was satisfying. Great narrators. Both added personality to the characters.,I really enjoyed book1. Book 2 however I am having a really hard time listening to and enjoying the new male narrator. The narration style in book 2 is annoying.,Loved both books in this series. Fantastic story and the characters are so easy to read and fall in love with.,Overall I enjoyed it.,I found the beginning kinda cringe and repetitive. We get it- you hate that he knows that you know blah blah blah. You hate that you know that he knows that you feel blah blah blah.,And the overuse of ‚Äúthere she is‚Äù,The trick is to lean into the tropey, cringy-ness of it all and just go with it.,Also- I need a break from books with girls getting wings. It‚Äôs hurts knowing i‚Äôll never fly üò´üòÇ,Like i said- overall I enjoyed it.,The narrators did a great job at bringing the story to life.,Thoroughly enjoyed it.  The switch between the two characters (and narrators), particularly at the end, add fantastically to the suspense. I'm looking forward to the next books.,Firstly the narration of this book was so good. Absolutely loved Aiden and always love Amanda.,I found this plotline to be a repetitive at times and issues with character development etc‚Ä¶.in saying that it‚Äôs a vampire love story I still absolutely loved it. Just not as much as the first."
Cook County ICU,"Medical,History & Commentary,Policy & Administration,State & Local,Intensive Medicine",Biographies & Memoirs,"Made me laugh a lot, even though im not in the medical field, I have found this book exciting and had to listen in one sitting.. Definitely recommend it..,Placing the abbreviation "" ICU"" in the title lead me to imagine much more interest stories.,The tales were  mostly G rated and without much genuine humor.  I found the narration wooden.,I appreciate the undeniable consciousness of the writer, but the stories I have heard and repeated over the years were much more exhilarating.,Doctor Franklin explains through stories of patients and himself or his colleagues, how Medicine has devolved from a covenant between patient and doctor, to a business, in which everybody is treated like ""corn or coal"". The writing is serene, but the subject makes the good doctor furious, and with a good reason. The hospitals where he once learned and practiced, places where doctors were proud of the virtue their trade represented, are now places where only one thing matters: money.,What a great read/listen. John Pruden does a good job of telling it all.,Self indulgent, moderately interesting, anecdotes where the author is the falsely modest hero of each one.,What would have made Cook County ICU better?,If the author had spoke more about the CC ICU and not his own grandiose perceptions,Would you ever listen to anything by Cory Franklin, MD again?,No - Save for some unsupported rhetoric I'm not sure I would even want to hear from this author again,You didn‚Äôt love this book...  but did it have any redeeming qualities?,There are some good 'Stories' in the book but some are at the expense of others, including family and patients - I think one's own character comes out best when they speak about others and not themselves-,Any additional comments?,Quite disappointed in the character as either accurately or inaccurately shown by this book-,,What made the experience of listening to Cook County ICU the most enjoyable?,I really enjoyed listening to all the interesting cases that Dr. Franklin wrote about in his book, and the interplay between his work life and the affects (positive and challenging) it had/has on his personal life.  Dr. Franklin is extremely honest about everything; this book isn't gory or disgusting, but it shows that doctors really are people and have strong feelings and emotional connection to their patients.,Which scene was your favorite?,My favorite scene in this listen was when Dr. Franklin wrote about a patient he saw in the clinic who ran a barbecue restaurant during his career.  The description of the emotional closeness of Dr. Franklin and his patient, whom he saw many times over the course of a few years, was beautiful.  The patient would bring the doctor a container of barbecue ribs at each of his clinic appointments and, later, an annual barbecued turkey (!) each year at Thanksgiving.  The patient would meet the doctor at the hospital each Thanksgiving morning to give the doctor the barbecued turkey, free of charge, to share with his family to thank the doctor for his care throughout the year.,Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?,I would certainly like to listen to this book all in one sitting, but as it is 7-12 hours long (I can't remember exactly how long it is now because I'm writing this review about 6 months after I finished listening), I would never have a span of time that long available to listen all in one sitting.  I certainly could listen to it and finish in one sitting; the book is well-written and would hold my attention long enough for me to listen all the way through.,Any additional comments?,Would certainly recommend this listen, especially if you like medically related books with firsthand stories of the cases that actually come through the doors of the hospital and clinic.,Loved it! Brought back memories of my over 40 years as a nurse. If we could only go back to the early 70s, when we could REALLY CARE for patients, NOT CLIENTS!,Ugh. This book had so much potential but sadly it fell very short of it. The Dr. that wrote this book is clearly knowledgable and he has good stories and experience which come across at times but mostly it's just shadowed by this personality that comes off like a major jerk. He whines about how he doesn't get credit for some medical discovery in a journal. He talks about pranks he plays on residents that aren't funny. Even his attempts at humility are lacking and seem disingenuous. I found his accounts of actual patients interesting but they were buried beneath layers of self centered, I'm a fancy Doctor, pat me on the back for x, y and z.,Also? The narrator doesn't help the case, his performance comes off as condescending which may very well be the case and he too hated the way the author spoke.,This book wasn‚Äôt for you, but who do you think might enjoy it more?,This book I did not like. I found it scary and so many reasons why things went wrong which I don't want to know about. It quite frightened me.,What do you think your next listen will be?,Learning your genealogy I thinks,Would you be willing to try another one of John Pruden‚Äôs performances?,Yes,You didn‚Äôt love this book...  but did it have any redeeming qualities?,no,I really enjoyed the patient cases and anecdotes about life as the author moved from intern to resident to full fledged physician. I wished he had spent more time on these then on trying to make them relatable to the ever changing healthcare system. These stories were incredibly interesting on their own without further exploration and make the book worthy of a listen.,I'm a radiologist and I have listened to this audiobook with great interest. It is written in a language that is easy to follow for non-medical listeners and interesting for professionals.,I loved it it's interesting to hear how medicine is set up in America and to hear about different conditions and treatment. couldn't put it down.,an insightful work, touching on  areas too often ignored nowadays. I recognise from my own childhood in London similar virtues of our local doctor and a service that is dying out.  I appreciate all those in the medical profession who despite the bureaucratic obstacles still endeavour to live up to the Hippocratic oath. I especially was taken with the last chapter regarding covenant v contract agreement/understanding.,overall an well written book narrated realistically filled with humour, insight and depth.,An excellent read. This book is full of pearls of experience and wisdom. Yes, one will learn little tidbits of medical information, but moreover you will get a taste of what it is like to be a doctor and to look after people. The great thing about Dr Franklin is his ability to convey the excitement of the practice of medicine, whilst still being honest about the day to day realities of the profession and the final chapter is a particularly honest representation of where medicine is at in today's world. As a doctor myself, I would highly recommend this title to any aspiring doctor or medical student, but also to the general audience wishing to understand and appreciate more about what doctors do for their fellow humans.,Many history about working in hospital with life experiences makes very valuable observations but same time same strong opinions about certain subject could be discussed . Funny episodes about medical arrogance something people still don't talk about.,too much exposition with a wooden delivery. if you are really into the genre read it otherwise stay away,big book, still sorry to reach the end.  chapter on being medical technical advisor on The Fugitive movie sublime/hilarious. hat off.,Interesting stories of American healthcare. If you liked ‚ÄúThis is going to hurt‚Äù by Adam Kay you‚Äôll enjoy this listen.,Would have used an Amazon credit for this book but thankfully it was free. One of the better listens. Narrator did a good job of bringing the book to life.,I enjoyed this. Absolutely worth a listen. His voice was easy and the stories although a little vague were interesting.,Sorry but not for me, not what I was expecting at all but some stories were interesting.,loved the listen. so many fascinating cases from his years of experience. His reflections on the medical system is insightful. It was narrated well.,A captivating listen as Dr Franklin takes you on a journey. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, particularly as the stories span over three decades showing just how much medicine has changed over the years.,I enjoyed the historical aspect of this book which is a bit like an autobiography rather than 'lectures'. How true are the changes in health care as far as the Dr/Patient relationship from older times when one was eye to eye where now the computer screen plays such a big part in the surgery or clinic.,Being approximately Dr Franklin's age it brought back many fascinating medical, along with general, snippets of interest. Very well narrated.,,easy to listen to. filled with fantastic stories. the anecdotes make you really think. i think the author would make a great dinner guest.,loved it, good stories from a great career which spaned over 40 years! highly recommended,Love the history as well as the updates on medical care and the writer‚Äôs personal experiences as a doctor. Narrator has a calm easy to listen to voice.,Chapter after chapter of humble bragging. Would like to hear more detail about actual cases rather than how amazing this doctor is. I gave it a fair shot, will be getting a refund. 2/5 Do not recommend."
By the Light of the Moon,"Psychological,Suspense","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","I love the Koontzian style! I know there are some readers who have become a bit snobbish over the years, but a good story that can bloom in your imagination for a few hours (with excellent prose and even alliteration!) is something sorely missing these days.,More like his older work. I liked the characters and the story. Kept me interested for sure.,,I hope that this is not a stand alone.  That instead, we have a start of another series of unlikely heroes, that have come together under circumstances that may still have room to unfold.,Lots of plot directions to go in for a series, overall a great read!,,Don't get me wrong, I adore Dean koontz, but when a character repeats the same word 75 times in 2 min. it really starts to get annoying, then everything, and I mean everything has some over-blown meaning and takes over 20 min. to finish, a scene that would take 30 seconds in a move is a 20 min. overblown diatribe drawn out into infinity.  With out a doubt the worst book I've ever read by Koontz.   And yep, I am a fan that would stand in line for 2 hours to get an autographed copy of dozens of his other books.,I loved this book. The synonyms that he added was awesome. Got a few chuckles on them. Got a read this book. Can't wait to see if he's going to do another one To match.,I‚Äôve been reading books by this author since I was in high school. Im 59 now and still an avid fan. A wonderful story filled with characters you care about. Great action and story as per usual.,I usually enjoy Dean Koontz very much but this was a miss. I only finished it because I paid for it. The concept was interesting but it seemed as if the time wasn't taken to really flesh out a good way to tell the story. If Koontz' name wasn't on this, no one could have convinced me he wrote it. The narrators made the dialogue sound like two petulant children, half the age of what the characters were supposed to be, on a Scooby Doo adventure.  I'm still a big enough fan of Koontz to shake this one off and look forward to other/better stories by this author.,Good story, decent narration, wordy and morally judgmental per usual. initial meeting scene between protagonists is cringy af. And Koontz's ""50's guy"" moral preaching is here though not as bad as in more recent works. If you can ignore the flaws though it's got good themes and execution.,,One of my favorite books. The plot and characters are imaginative, fun and a little sci-fi! Great job Audibleüëå,I read Koontz thru the early/mid 90‚Äôs. Either he was much better then, my taste was less evolved, or some combination. Of the two. Found other authors for awhile but came back for Frankenstein, but quit that series part way thru when it lost all sense of purpose and direction. Felt like a money grab.,Someone told me this book was good‚Ä¶it isn‚Äôt. The narration is confusing; male and female reading random lines and the same characters for no apparent reason; the male narrator was boring but the female was notably better.,The worst was the writing itself. Koontz has developed a style of talking down to the reader, as if to explain every minute detail as if we aren‚Äôt smart enough to get it. Which is ironic, since the plot was paper thin with zero twists. Characters were not developed at all and with some, it seemed Koontz went out of his way to make you hate them in the first few chapters. Then joints provided the killing stroke to his own story; trying to politicize parts of it while at the same time seeming to know very few details of what he‚Äôs talking about. I can‚Äôt understand how this made it thru multiple rounds of editing and proof reading and still made it to print.,I think this will be the last Koontz book I read.,Great story and set up to continue for further adventures. I just wish it was read by someone with an English accent. I found it sounded quite robotic and took a while to get used to.,The writing had me on the edge of my seat on several occasions. Loved it!,The narration worked fine fine for me as it was obvious from who‚Äôs perspective it was from. Nearly gave up after 90 mins but persevered- a decent yarn but a little quick to end. Not a DK but still good.,,I've been a Dean Koontz fan since I was 12 I'm 54 now and I believe he's getting better. I can't understand the negative reviews here. Simply uncalled for. The beautiful yet strained relationship between two brothers and a quirky friend faced with the impossible... Brilliant!!!!,Poor story. Ridiculous dialogue. Persevered until chapter six then abandoned.,Would not recommend for Koonz fans who expect something better.,Watchers and Lighting by Dean Koonts are my 2 Favourite books so when I listened to By the Light of the Moon I had high hopes. I was very disappointed. It was by far the worst Book I‚Äôve ever listened to. The only reason I listened to the end was just to see how it finished up. I wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered!,Having 2 readers read the same character is annoying as you lose track of the story as the both have different voices for the same characters,I struggled to read this book as an autistic person because the author expresses very ableist views about level 3 autistic people.  I cringed at many of the lines said by the female lead,Great storyline but way too much attention to detail.  I found myself increasing the spread just to get through it.,As a Dean Koontz fan, this one doesn't disappoint.,Great fun.,Worth the money indeed.,I absolutely love Koontz‚Äôs storyline‚Äôs but his over description of every single item is sooooooooo annoying, it makes for very boring listening when he waffles on and on just get on with the story Dean for Pete‚Äôs sake!!,I totally love this book another Awesome book by Dean Koontz and his nano bots Thank you so much,for a grate book enjoyed every page and chapter üíôüíúüíôüíúüíôüíúüíôüíú"
Secret Mafia Daddy,"Action & Adventure,Contemporary",Romance,"So this was a cute story, obviously mafia themed but still the way the MMC falls for his ‚Äúsurprise ‚Äú  was adorable. I however struggled with the narrators. The female was way to extra, and the male wasn‚Äôt terrible but was lackluster. I think I‚Äôd enjoy this more read as a regular book, as some audio will make or break a book. But I did x1.5 it so it made it a bit better.  This was a fast pace book, so get ready for a wild ride.,I received this audio for free, with my review entirely my own done in exchange.,This is Angelo and Catarina's story. It is a very captivating and thrilling page turning read. They have a one night stand turned forced marriage mafia romance.  I loved the intensity and chemistry between this couple. I couldn't put this page turning read down. I enjoyed that narration made the story all the more thrilling and captivating.,Story review:,MMC/FMC- Angelo and Catarina,POV- 1st person dual,Genre- Mafia Romance,Heat- üåãüåãüåã.

Welcome to the Trope-icana.,What I liked- I cannot even begin to express how happy I am that the heroine never called the Hero ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù, despite the title. The book was very readable, with hot zexytime and a Lightning Bolt Love Realization. The daughter‚Äôs loot from the ‚Äútreasure hunt‚Äù made me laugh out loud. And some of the wedding cake options made my mouth water.,What I didn‚Äôt- the bakery thought it was acceptable to put beetroot in a wedding cake. Oh, the humanity!,Verdict- enjoyable,,Narration review:,The narration was awful. The female voice acting was one of the most annoying that I‚Äôve ever listened to. It made listening to this book honestly painful. And the male voice wasn‚Äôt much better. His acting was unconvincing, alternating between wooden and overemphasized. I recommend skipping the audiobook and recommend reading the ebook.,,I received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.,Secret Mafia Daddy is an entertaining drama with stubborn, independent main characters who have outstanding chemistry but neither of which want to be tied down. Angelo and Catarina have a complex and fun story, an adorable little girl, and interesting issues to overcome. The male narrator did a great job of bringing Angelo to life, and the female narrator created a very realistic mafia princess.,,I received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.,This was a pretty good mafia romance.  Several years ago, Cat has a one-night stand with Angelo and ends up getting pregnant.  A few years later, they reconnect at a club where she sees him murder someone.  At first, he could not remember where he met her, being the manwh@re that he is.  He decides that as his wife, she cannot testify against him so he takes her.  He finds out she has a child and when he sees the child, he realizes she is his child and he is not happy because he missed the first three years of her life.  Angelo wants to be in his daughter's life and turns out to be such a loving father.  This turned out to be a good book about how they made it work after getting married and becoming a ready-made family in his world even though Cat did something really stupid  and gets kidnapped.  Ryder Wolfe and Serena Moon did a good job with the narration.  I received this free copy audiobook and have voluntarily left this review.,Excellent story! Angelo and Catarina had a night of unprotected sex several years ago, a one night stand so to speak. Move to the present, and Angelo is a mafia prince. He is estranged from his father. Catarina is a mafia princess, raised by her step-father. She wants to get out of the life style, and take her daughter someplace safer. Catarina is a witness to Angelo committing murder. It is either marry Angelo, as spouses can‚Äôt testify against each other, or be killed Witnesses are not allowed to live. She opts for the marriage, and plans to disappear as soon as she safely can. The first time Angelo sees Caterina‚Äôs daughter, he remembers their one night, and knows that the child is his daughter. Saying he is mad is an understatement, how dare she not tell him he is a father! Turns out he makes a good daddy. A lot of drama, emotional angst, kidnapping, and subterfuge happen. While all this is happening, Angelo and Catarina realize they fell for each other.,It was a good story, and well written. I really liked Angelo. The narration was well done, and a pleasure to listen to. I received a free copy of this audiobook and am voluntarily leaving my review.,,Angelo and Catarina shared one night together that left Catarina pregnant. Fast forward a few years later, and they meet again. Catarina immediately recognizes Angelo, but she is reluctant to have anything to do with him - especially when he doesn‚Äôt recognize her. Unfortunately for Catarina, she witnesses Angelo commit a crime, and she is forced to marry him as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave her child without a mother. Upon meeting Catarina‚Äôs daughter, Angelo realizes she is his child. Eventually, Angelo lets go of his anger and resentment towards Catarina, and he starts to understand that he wants a future with both of his girls. However, Catarina desperately wants to get away from the mafia life, but is Angelo willing to give it up to be with them?,,The narrators did a great job at making you feel all the emotions of these characters. This is a great, fast paced, second chance, mafia romance that grabbed my attention and would not let go. Angelo and Catarina reconnect about 4 years after they have an amazing one night stand. These two try to fight their connection and chemistry but forced proximity and mafia business truly help them to find that deeper connection. A solid 4.5 star enjoyable listen.,,I received a free copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review."

Charm,Paranormal,Teen & Young Adult,"This moves backwards to when Hudson and Grace are trapped in her head. Which seems redundant and pushes her character backwards in my mind and not forward. Listening to hours of grace being hateful and cruel to Hudson got a little old. This whole story played out in crush. Enemies to Lovers troupe with these same two characters is very mundane, repetitive and boring to say the least.,,Wish this book would have moved the story forward and they could have done this book as a bonus after the conclusion of the series. Next book isn‚Äôt for another year.,Overall, I really like the story. However, it‚Äôs really distracting how it switches narrator‚Äôs so frequently. I disliked this in the previous books too, but at least it was a lot less in the others.  I would have given 5 stars otherwise. I think I would feel differently if the guy always did the Hudson parts, but because the gal did the Hudson‚Äôs voice throughout most of the other books, I got used to that voice as Hudson and therefore the male narrator felt foreign. I would love to have all of these books with only the gal doing the whole thing.,1st person/dual pov,Spice: 1/5 - keep in mind this is YA so for me it was more than fade to black but not quite ""smut"",,Oh... My... Heart!!!,Before I get into my review of the actual book I want to talk about the performance of the narrators. Heather Costa IS Grace. She also IS Hudson lol! So we are used to Heather doing the majority of the narration for each book up until this one. There have been a few chapters at the end or beginning of the other books from Hudson's POV (and possibly Jaxson's, I can't remember so I could be wrong on that) that were performed by Tim Paige. My personal preference is 1st person with dual or multi pov over getting only one character pov - especially when there is a love story involved. So, when I realized this book was dual pov I was extremely excited! Heather was perfect as usual and the voice that she gives Hudson is what I expect when his character has a witty one-liner or some other sarcastic thing to say. I adored Tim Paige's performance of Hudson in the other books as well as how he played any side characters that may have had lines in those chapters but then Hudson's first pov chapter started in this one and I realized I never paid attention to the names of the narrators for this book. Because Hudson didn't sound like Hudson in his chapter. Well, that's because there is a different narrator this time for him. So that took quite a bit of getting used to in the beginning, sort of having to rewire my brain to match up this new voice with a character that I have grown accustomed to sounding a certain way. However, I understand sometimes things happen and it is unavoidable that a person has to be swapped out for another, so I mostly got over it. The only thing I would have changed in that regard if Tim was no longer an option is to give Liam Price a little more guidance on how to become Hudson. Obviously, he won't sound exactly the same but I found his interpretation of Hudson to sound somewhat whiny. It was as if Hudson was grumbling and griping with every single word he said - like a spoiled child. When he should have sounded arrogant and sarcastic but in a way that is sort of playful (like he's being snobbish on purpose to get under your skin). With everything he's been through and survived despite not feeling loved, his character is in no way a whiner. Now when it came to confessing his feelings towards and about Grace I feel Liam did an excellent job of making Hudson sound completely consumed by those feelings and his love for Grace. It was just everything else that fell a little flat. I also felt there should have been more of a differentiation between the male and female characters' voices, as there were a few times I wasn't sure what character was talking because the female characters sounded exactly the same as the males did. So all in all I wasn't as much of a fan of the Hudson chapters in this one. I do agree that maybe Heather should have voiced the majority of the book if not all of it if Tim wasn't available to do Hudson's. Nothing against Liam, I just don't think he was the right choice for Hudson and his feminine voices need some work. Performance wise 4 stars - maybe 4.5 because like I said Heather rocked her parts as usual. But enough about that let us get down to what's really important and that is the story itself.,,If you've read the series up to this point then you know that this book gives us the answers to what happened during those 4 months between book 1 and book 2 that Grace couldn't remember. If you haven't read this series up to this point then do not read this review any further because yes, there will probably be spoilers for the other books.,,Last chance...,.,.,.,Ok, so we knew something went down between Grace and Hudson when they were trapped in her fortified gargoyle state. I naturally assumed that they grew closer and became very friendly during this time from the way Hudson acted in book 2 once they returned to the academy. While Grace didn't remember anything and I knew she had to have formed a connection to Hudson I didn't consider a lot of what happened here as a possibility. I knew Hudson had developed some sort of feelings for her based on his actions throughout most of the book but at this point, I still assumed it was mostly one-sided. Then of course we see what happens with his brother and then watch her fall for Hudson along the journey to defeat his father and save the world. But I still wondered what happened when they were frozen since Hudson made it seem like it was so important. Enter book 5 and it holds every single answer I knew I needed and even a few I didn't know I needed!,,Now I have seen some reviews complaining that this book wasn't needed. I've also seen some complaints about it being released after book 4 instead of between books 1 and 2. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions I don't agree with them. Here is why - this book was released at the perfect moment and it was exactly as it should have been done. In this book, we get to see Grace and Hudson when they first arrive in this space that is sort of between worlds. Which, as we found out in an earlier book, was a replica of Hudson's ""lair"" with Grace's twist on it. They go from hating each other, more so Grace hating him really, due to the information that Grace has been given about Hudson by his brother and anyone else at Katmere. He's the bad guy and not to be trusted by everyone else. Over a year goes by in this space together, and while they annoy the absolute crap out of each other (which is adorably funny btw), they also get to see a side of each other no one else has. Hudson gets to see who Grace truly is even before she came to Katmere, courtesy of having access to every single memory she has. And Grace has access to Hudson's journals from when he was a boy up through adulthood. These journals are heartbreaking to read and show her the truth of Hudson Vega. That he is the bad guy everyone believes him to be so that he can be the good guy no one sees coming. He can do the hard things to protect thousands of innocent people because he has no problem being the bad guy to do so. The enemy doesn't see him coming this way and no one gets hurt in the blowback but him.,Everything Grace thought she knew about him was false because the people that told her didn't have his truth. She starts to see him with new eyes as she realizes that they may never make it back to Katmere. Next thing you know they are forced out of this sanctuary and on the run from a threat unlike anything they've encountered before. When it becomes clear they aren't going to be returning to Katmere ever again they set out to just survive. To build the best life they can in this new home they've found. They are all each other has now and as they grow even closer they begin to fall. (Obviously, we know at this point what happens with the whole mating bonds thing in the end but remember in this timeline, in this book, Grace doesn't know any of this yet.),This is why we needed this book. We needed to see the two of them fall in love, to see the journey they took together and the life they were building. The home they fought to protect in this new place as well as back in our world. We see a side of Hudson that no one ever has. He is finally living a life that, while it has a few minor drawbacks given the environment of this new world they're in, he never thought was possible back home. It's a clean slate for him. We learn more about what he went through as a child and the decisions he made that led him to what everyone thought was his death. We also see a love that grows and blossoms into something unbreakable.,,Now here's why we didn't need this book before now... If we had gotten this book after book 1 then nothing in book 2 would have been a surprise. We would have known Hudson wasn't really the bad guy from the start. We would have known about his connection to Grace. We would have seen so much of Hudson so early on that we couldn't fully appreciate who he is as a character. In my opinion, it would have ruined books 2-4 to have all of this information beforehand. Because looking back, and knowing what I know after reading this book, I love him even more. I can appreciate how he kept all of this to himself once they returned to Katmere without Grace's memory. I can appreciate how he was prepared to step aside and allow Grace and his brother to be together so long as Grace was truly happy, even if it meant the only happiness and love Hudson had ever experienced was snatched away from him. This utterly broke my heart if I'm being honest. In fact, every single moment between the two of them over those 3 books I am now looking at with new eyes. All of this makes the love they share, the fact that we get to witness them falling in love twice under these wild circumstances, and despite everything thrown at them, so much more satisfying in the end. So no, we absolutely didn't need this book to be published at any point before right now. The author did the story as a whole justice by keeping it from us until the right moment. She did Hudson Vega justice as he is one of the most selfless and loving characters I've ever read without sacrificing any of the snark and confidence I love in the ""bad boy"" persona. He is perfection!,Grace is pretty awesome too, but we've had 4 whole books of her coming into her own. For me, this book was all about showcasing why Hudson is so special, as well as giving us the backstory we needed before going into book 6. This is how you tell a story, people! This is wonderfully thought out and planned in a way that slowly gives you all the answers you need but just enough that it keeps you coming back for more (and not bored in my opinion) until you finally reach the finale. And considering how things went down in this book, and where they are going in the next one, I have a feeling it's going to drag so many emotions out of me only to reward me with the perfect ending.,,Even though I don't want it to end, because I'm not yet ready to say goodbye to Grace and Hudson, especially Hudson lol, I also can't wait to see them get the happily ever after they both deserve!,I love the crave series!,This book was kind of a let down for the first 100 chapters, it had a long build up that could have been shortened and added more action packed scenes. Which I know will come with the next book in the series. Once you get to the middle of the book it‚Äôs great!! Smokey is a great character, which I enjoyed seeing Grace and Smokey‚Äôs relationship change throughout the book. Can‚Äôt wait for the next book to come out (:,Heather has an amazing voice to narrate Grace. Always entertaining and gives the story an elevated level of entertainment. I personally was not a fan of Liam‚Äôs voice narrating Hudson. Liams voice was boring and sounded like a commercial for listing all the side effects from taking a medication. I always listen to the book while I read and much preferred the previous voice actor in the previous books in the series.,this breaks my heart for Hudson. he's my favorite character in the series and now knowing this, him being so kind to grace when she came back from being a gargoyle makes me love him more,All of the stories leading up to this book were great, but this story about how Grace forgot about the love she shared with Hudson and what they did how they lived while they were lost in the shadow realm is the ultimate love story if you didn‚Äôt love Hudson before you will truly truly love him now I‚Äôm so happy that Tracy Wolff decided to write this book to let us know how they lived how they loved while they were lost in time.  Listening to this book my heart would ache for Hudson to know that he remembered everything the time they shared when they were lost in the shadow realm, and Grace didn‚Äôt remember any of it.,Didn‚Äôt want it to end !! Good thing there is more !! Every book is interesting and on the edge of your seat exciting.,I love the story. Getting to hear the backstory made this more than just a teenage love story. The depth than this story provides was perfect. Only issue was the male voice actor. He sounded as enthusiastic as a nature documentary talking about osmosis‚Ä¶ wish I could give a 3.5 but since it‚Äôs only full stars over all I‚Äôll bump to 4/5 stars because I liked the story.,This is my favorite book from this series so far!! It had me falling in love with these two over and over and it was so vivid in detail like a movie I want to watch over and over,While I haven‚Äôt listened to the last book, this book is my favorite in the series. Loved it!!,I have loved this series, I was slightly sceptical of this book at first, but I started to really love it half way through. Would seriously recommend!,,I'm happy to finally hear from both of their sides how they fall in love. Very much looking forward to listen to the next book. I gave 4 stars for the story,because in some parts it was a little childish to me.,Overall I love this book :) and I hope many of you will do too üôè,I adored this book.,I was thrilled when I first found out that Grace and Hudson would be getting their own book. I liked the slow burn romance at the beginning of the book and how their loved changed throughout.,I laughed and cried along with Grace and Hudson throughout this book.,It was really easy to listen to and the narrators did a great job bringing everyone/everything to life.,,I was invested in Hudson and Grace which is why I continued reading. The story is all over the place, most of it doesn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere! Words for the sake of words in some places.,Wow‚Ä¶ just wow‚Ä¶. If you love these books, this one cannot be missed. A look into the time we all thought we knew, and yet we knew NOTHING!!!,I couldn't put it down and and the voice actors are so much better this time,Nice fill in story to complete Grace & Hudson‚Äôs relationship, only issue was the male voiceover is ok but not great.,If you‚Äôre a fan of Tracy Wolff‚Äôs Crave series, you‚Äôll absolutely love this Shadow Realm recollection of Grace and Hudson‚Äôs time together.,New friends, love, hate, arguments, battles‚Ä¶epic sums it up. Just waiting for the final instalment ü§©,The voices of the narrators are so awful.,The female narrator's English accent is appalling and the male narrator's entire performance is unbearable.,I was looking forward to this book, even pre-ordered it, but I don't think I will listen/read it now.,It was everything I didn‚Äôt even know I had hoped the book would be. Absolutely perfectüò≠ so sad it ended because I wanna listen forever!,Makes you realise why there‚Äôs a huge spark between grace and hudson and why he felt hurt her not knowing what happened.,Such a great book, incredible to see what happened in those missing months and just makes me love Grace and Hudson even more. Definitely doesn't feel like you're going backwards, it's just so perfect.,This book was a really great read! Loved Hudson‚Äôs voice! Loved the story of the missing 4 months! Just overall loved this book.,Makes me want to re-read book 2.,Thank you for changing the voice of Hudson! Liam Price gives Hudson the character he needed. Finally a version of Hudson that fits what I was trying to imagine, which was hard with the voices presented by Heather and Tim.,This book filled in the gaps and created the next hype for the next book. Count down on again‚Ä¶,Loved the Story of Grace and Hudson being fully told üíï,I wish I knew what had happened during the 4 months during book 2 , but this was a good way of dealing with it... I almost need to go back and read book 2 !,Amazing boook! May is sooo far away for the next one. Lol. Really enjoyed this!"

Take Control of Your Life,"Motivation & Self-Improvement,Anxiety Disorders,Personal Development,Self Development,Self Control",Business & Careers,"When I turned this book on I wasn't sure what to expect. Much of self help seems to be a repeat of the same stuff (get up early, stop being a victim, meditate, eat healthy, think positive, ect) so I wasn't sure what spin Mel would bring to this topic. I am a big fan of Mel's and did listen to Kick Ass, her last book. I loved Kick Ass so I did have high hopes for this. When I saw Mel mention her new book in her newsletter I downloaded it right away. Now that I've finished‚ÄìWOW is all I can say. First, it's way way longer than Kick Ass and has tons of information in it. So much. It's all about how fear holds us back and how we can figure out the way that fear affects us as a person and change that. Mel says that it doesn't matter what other habits you have if you're held hostage by fear, and that really rang true with me. Like Kick Ass this book has coaching sessions, but in this case the coaching sessions were more of teaching moment. Then, after each session, Mel would talk for over an hour about each, sharing advice and takeaways. My favorite part of the book was when Mel shared her personal stories. I didn't realize how funny she is! I also liked how there were a variety of people coached. While I definitely resonated with some more than others, I did get something from each one. I also thought it was good how Mel really went through each action item in a ton of detail and shared the research and science behind what she was teaching. As I was listening the only downside was that there is SO much information covered that it was hard to remember it all (I listened to most of it in the car). Which is why I am so happy to see that Audible included a workbook in my library. I took a look at the workbook and saw that the lessons are all summarized which is so helpful! I am going to start filling out the workbook this weekend. Overall, Mel, you have done it again. This book was such an amazing listen and I couldn't believe how many times I nodded my head thinking ""SHE GETS ME."",I love Mel Robbins and think she is very gifted motivational speaker. I purchased the book to gain some insight on how to overcome fear.  However, the format of the book (listening to various therapy sessions) did not leave me feeling uplifted, but rather depressed. Some of the stories involve very complex personality issues, stories of abuse, etc.  I have no doubt Mel was enormously helpful for these individuals, but I found this audiobook very difficult to listen to. I ended up scanning through and attempting to listen to each story and ultimately returned it.,Wow!! Not sure what to say other than this audio book is pure gold!!  If you are on the fence in regards to the purchase, you will not regret it.  I love how she uses real life stories and situations to teach. The best part is that you are a VIP inside these coaching sessions. So much value inside! Thank you, Mel :),Honestly, this felt to me like a one hour book.,It is LIFE CHANGING, thought-modifying, relationship-building and boundary-setting all at once.,Perhaps because this showed up in Divine Timing for me.,Quite frankly, I was put off by the title as my life is not ""out of control"", but this has been a great kick in the posterior and a magnifying mirror enlarging my unpolished corners. Time for a shoe shine.,ps- I have never heard of the author prior to getting the book and her accent or voice (not sure which) aggravates me (I was raised abroad).,Yet, I got over myself as the author is as effective as an awful-tasting medicine you know you need.,If you can stomach the truth, the finish will be sweet.,Buckle Up!,Your life is about to change...,From a young age, many of us were taught to look on the bright side whenever life beat us down. But according to Mel Robbins, staying positive might actually be causing the beatings life keeps handing out. Mel engages six fear-avoidant friends in deep, honest, and difficult discussions‚Äîsix living, breathing case studies on silencing lifelong fears. In doing so, every listener becomes a participant in a greater, more meaningful conversation‚Äîone that will stick with you long after you're done listening.,This book brought awareness of my negative beliefs, thoughts and body language. I discovered my fear and it really changed how I view the world now. I have been a chameleon, people pleaser most of my life. I couldn't believe that I did it without thinking. No wonder why I have so much anger, resentment built inside of me. I now know why I get so defensive and judgmental. It was awesome to hear the coach sessions because I am not alone and it feels good knowing other people struggle with the same issues. The techniques Mel talks about in each session is game changing. I apply them one day at a time, brick by brick and in small doses so I don;t get overwhelmed and end up with the reverse effect. I unfollowed so many people on all my social media channels to get that poison out of my life and it really works. The only things I see now are things that make me happy, empower me and help me get to my dream and goals. Changing your mindset and gaining control of your mind is truly the most powerful thing a person can do for themselves. It is truly game changing and empowering. I am so proud of myself for taking these steps and investing in me. Mel, you helped me change my mind and I love you for it. I can't wait for the next book to come out....your talk show... and new videos... You saved me from living a dark depressing life... I am now the CEO of my life, thoughts, dreams and actions...,Wow. I'm just finishing up this audiobook and I feel like I'm going to need a few days to digest this. I actually had to keep pausing the book to take notes on my phone because there are so many nuggets in here I didn't want to forget. Though I resonated with everyone in this book to some extent, I think I am most like Dan. Sooo much I want to do in this lifetime and there are days it feels like I'm running out of time. But now I understand that by living in that kind of mindset, time is actually moving faster. OMG, so true! So this past weekend I scheduled a few minutes to sloooow way down, and I planned a few bricks for the week. :) Thanks, Mel! Loving your work.,This audible was and is going to so influential in helping me rewrite the ending of my story. I was moved to tears multiple times during this audible. I have and am taking steps to de-clutter my physical things and most importantly my mental ‚Äúthings‚Äù.,Would absolutely recommend this book. Use the online workbook alongside the audiobook, it has great introspective exercises.,Mel has great energy, I listened to the book at 1.25 speed and it flowed really well.,This Audible Original series with Mel is really quite powerful. It doesn't build on her earlier release, but instead digs into the real roadblocks to us being able to live a full and fulfilled life. It doesn't seem to matter how big or small our fears, whatever we conjure up - they still manage to slow our progress. She offers some diversity of perspective given the different interviewees and their background.  Her voice allows you to accelerate the listening speed and still easily digest the concepts.  Well done.,I want to say I did enjoy this audible and you can always take away some key points!,However being British I really struggled with the Americanised 1 to 1 interviews where it did seem very very set up and false! Never felt genuine, Mels responses were far to quick before the individuals finished there sentences.,I prefer raw, factual, straight forward believable stories where they don‚Äôt feel set up, over the top and Americanised!,Yes you can take some good points but overall I would not have chosen this audio and I feel a lot of other British listeners will understand when I say there are some major Cringe moments at the American OTT mentoring going on.,I do not wish to run this audio down but I wanted to be honest.,I liked 5 second rule but this isn‚Äôt for me. (So much so I actually pressed the skip button through the interviews because I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to listen to the way they were taking),,...in one sentence...find out what provokes fear in you and 'address' it....not especially helpful.  Seems like a nice enough woman but not life changing stuff.  I'm not a big fan of case histories there's no 6 sizes fit all.,This book should come with a warning!! ‚ÄúDo not read unless you want a profound wake up call‚Äù!!!,Seriously though, what an amazing experience to share other people‚Äôs stories and see yourself in (almost) every example. ‚ÄúI do that‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me‚Äù,I guess now I have to face the fear, change the patterns and become the person I want, and deserve, to be. ‚ù§Ô∏è,I normally LOVE Mel Robbins books, but this one just felt contrived.  It is 'real' sessions with various people who are held back in achieving their goals due to the fears they hold.  On some sessions Mel appeared to coax them into saying how they felt, by a strange coincidence, she too had the same fears/traits as each of the 3 sessions I listened to (I think there are 6),,I will be returning this book, I persevered with a few sessions in the hope it would improve, but to be honest the people just seemed to whinge, with no real issues that needed solving, it was like they just wanted to meet Mel Robbins, so said all the things they thought she wanted to hear, it even made me doubt they were real - it was nothing like Kick Ass which I absolutely loved.,,I hope Mel does not churn out any other mundane books like this, stick to the coaching that you are absolutely brilliant at.  Make people think differently to bring about change in their life....but not this nonsense with people crying because they had strict parents and they only got 93 in a test - Jeez!!!!!,Mel has upped her game which I personally didn't think was possible. She takes the personal development game to a new level. This audio is helping me overcome my desire for perfectionism and get on with LIFE! Love you Mel xox,Truly on one the best I‚Äôve listened to - and I‚Äôve listened to many! Heaps of key takeaways resonated and brought me to tears as I had my own mini breakthroughs. Highly recommended.,I‚Äôve learned so much from this even though I‚Äôve done a ton of work to figure me out in the last 10yrs.,It gets right to the point in a caring, no nonsense way which is deeply moving, helpful and refreshing.,Each coaching session Mel shares here had take aways for me. Now for the action.,I plan on returning here in 6 months with a new review and an update of how much I‚Äôve improved my life after Mel so wonderfully spot lighted a multitude of issues and solutions to take action on.,Game changer.,I've only listened to a quarter of this book so far, but I love, love, love what I'm hearing.  I'm a huge fan of Mel Robbins and have other material/programmes that she has done, but this book so far is the best yet ! I love her down to earth manner and she really gets into your head. Her advice works, if you are willing to listen, learn and do the work one small brick at a time, you will breakthrough ! highly recommended. There's also a workbook to go with it which is once  again excellent content, great practical guidelines.,I don‚Äôt like to criticise books as books are knowledge and written by someone more knowledgeable than me about the given subject. I bought this as it appeared in recommendations given my listening history. Downloaded it having just read You‚Äôre A Badass by Jen Sincero so I was hoping of much the same. Different style and more of case studies than the actual author talking. The opening music also felt a little haunting. I‚Äôm sure there is a lot to learn from this book and I do appreciate it has helped so many others, but style not for me.,,Very negative , more like listening to therapy sessions of people complaining of the lack of control than actually teaching anything . lack of positive words .,After a long intro with some good ideas on the topic there are 6 stories from other people. This book isn't what it presents itself as, feeling pretty ripped off right now.,Not an audoobook but a replay of someone's workday. No questions about the authors knowledge, enthusiasm or personality. Though I felt a little robbed with book when it just turned into recordings of conversations with clients. Not what I would look for in a book, perhaps a podcast.,It is very rare that I would believe a review that says a book will change your life so when I say that this audiobook will change your life it is not said lightly! For anyone willing to look inwards and take control of their life, this is a game changer. It is like a coaching session for yourself with Mel and is so relevant to all of us! Thank you Mel for this wonderful piece of work!,Cases are well picked, so everyone with anxiety problems can relate to one of them.,Analysis are pragmatic and clear to help you to tackle your own issues.,A very good book to help you understand yourself and your own mental pattern.,Finally a book that spoke to me and helped me to understand why I perceive situations the way I do.,So good.,9+ hours but worth every minute.,I‚Äôll be listening to it again for sure.,This book had so many ah ha moments for me,,This book is amazing!! It has full sessions of therapy that identify many of the issues we all experience. Mel is engaging , kind and empathetic and gives us so many life lessons that we all need. This book is easy to listen to and easier to take the lessons from. A truly enjoyable experience!,No, really. It will change your life. I‚Äôve recommended to friends, and they‚Äôve recommended it to more friends. It triggered so much in me so deeply, that I was shocked at first but now feeling liberated.,Loved it and will listen to it again. Never realised how much fear of failure has been holding me back until I listened to this. Now it seems so obvious! Would love to hear some follow up stories...,Found this book to be really interesting. The case studies are real and enabled me to relate. Loved it and I love Mel‚Äôs presentation. She‚Äôs great to listen to. I want more!,"
The Twelve Dates of Christmas,"Holidays,Contemporary,Romantic Comedy",Literature & Fiction,"Such a cute story, but I‚Äôm not a fan of profanity. Four F words and other profanity throughout. If that doesn‚Äôt bother you than you‚Äôll love the book!! The narrator was AMAZING. Her voice was like silk as she described things. She would make a potato sound like the most beautiful thing ever haha!,While I didn't love this book it was still a fun, easy and enjoyable read. I loved the festive side of course all the snow and Kate with her baking and John with his coffee shop. Also all the date activities brought out the Merry Christmas of the story. The main character Kate was relatable and very likable. She tried to turn any situation fun with had me guffawing. The gingerbread house that's all I'm going to say HAHA.,Although I did wanted to judge Kate for being too picky but when it got down to it you should be picky about finding a partner to spend your life with. Also to me is wasn't realistic for every date to be hot and have a nice job. But the best thing of all was there was no cheese. Even if it helps me get past the corny-ness I do dislike rolling my eyes at romance dialog and lucky this was kept light and fun.,The worst part to me though was knowing who she would end up with from the very beginning. And that made the ending not very spectacular either. A lot of things were too predictable. Still though Kate carried this story with her quick wit and fun banter. Also Elizabeth Knowelden did a great job narrating. It made the story even more fun.,This book is adorable. I thought the concept of the twelve dates was original and fun. A bit predictable, but I enjoyed all the characters. And I love a good English Christmas romance! The narrator was so pleasant to listen to. I would love to read a sequel!,This book had some good parts, but it didn‚Äôt really do it for me. I really enjoyed the premise of the dates and going to each date but everything else was a bit boring. There was also a lot of stuff with the landscape and her designing that felt like unnecessary filler. Also, I started to get annoyed by how many times we had to hear about that darn hill her car couldn't drive up in the snow and listening to the times she walked the hill in a blizzard.,,The relationship between Kate and Matt didn‚Äôt work for me at all. I never felt anything beyond a basic friendship with their chemistry. Also, the way he treated her each time he was upset or uncertain was toxic. I would never enter a relationship with anyone who behaved that way, and she should have cut ties with him. I'm also disappointed that since I didn't feel romantic chemistry between them, it didn't make me all happy and giddy to see them end up together. I felt absolutely nothing for them.,,The writing bothered me at times. There was a bit too much he said/she said. At one point, I about died when I heard, """"Kate,"" Matt said. ""Matt,"" Kate said."",,It was fun to see all of the different date ideas and the dates she was paired with.,,The narration was good.,I enjoyed this audiobook so much, and it sets the perfect mood for the holidays.  I will re-listen to this while baking, crafting & wrapping, because this story inspires one to get lost in all things Christmas.  I laughed and smiled at the story, and didn't even care if it was a bit predictable (which I had read in some other reviews).  It was still completely delightful and the narrator was EXCELLENT - & perfect for this story.  I highly recommend this light-hearted, festive listen!,I really enjoyed this book. At times the prose was quite beautiful. Even though it checked all the boxes (Christmas time, charming and small hometown, lost childhood sweetheart etc) it did it in its own unique way that actually made the journey much more enjoyable. I was actually charmed by the small town instead of just tolerating it as a cheesy stereotype. I loved the narration as well.,Knowelden really does bring anything and everything she performs to life. Its actually hard to tell sometimes how good the actual book is because of how much i enjoy just listening to her put her spirit into the work. She embodies the characters with this magical energy that makes me feel personally close to the people shes represneting and get lost in the story, whatever it may be. However, that being said i do have a few bones to pick with the actual story and some choices the author made that i cant get behind. I really wasnt a big fan of how abrasive and childish the obvious main love interest was. You can tell in the first chapter who the HEA persons guna be but its like hes got 2 sides to himself and yeah ones sweet and easy going but then at the drop of a pin he says and does the most evil things and is a childish menace.  Its not even really discussed which is not okay. This dude acts like a complete horses (you know what) then its like oh i love you oh i love you too! .....üôÑ...... come on now....,The whole 12 dates thing was a nice plot point and i enjoyed the ride getting to the end and the end itself wasnt so bad i just honestly could see a few unsavory types ive known in the past as this clown that was that our MC was so into for some reason and it left a bad taste in my ears. Theres some things you just shouldnt say and if someone makes a habit of saying things of that nature multiple times you better believe its guna happen again and again. some things shouldnt just be forgiven and forgotten so easily like its perfectly okay because its not. But like i said Elizabeth Knowelden reading this book really made me get into it more than i probably would have otherwise if anyone else might have done it so im glad they got her, shes so amazingüëè .,Worth listening to, nothing special (except for the narration, she IS specialüòú),It was difficult for me to get through the first chapter‚Ä¶or two. There was too much going on and too many characters to keep up with. Someone works for someone and so and so is the daughter or father or this person or other. Omg. It‚Äôs written out as though we‚Äôre watching a movie and able to keep up. After that, the love story that unfolds isn‚Äôt original. You can see it coming at you plain as day from a mile away. It‚Äôs ends nicely, tightly wrapped in the Christmas theme. But it was unnecessary drama watching the love story unfold.,While it‚Äôs not a surprise ending, it‚Äôs a well performed and entertaining story. Laughed out loud several times!,Whimsical with delicious treats, fairy lights, English holiday markets, fun date ideas and some love twists. One of the best Christmas books I've read in a long time. I will be listening to this again next year!"
Haven: The Complete Series,"Action & Adventure,Genre Fiction,Anthologies & Short Stories,Post-Apocalyptic",Literature & Fiction,"This is not what I was expecting. I almost stopped listening half way through book 2 due to the total level and low quality of smut written in this series. Almost comes off as a virgin teenage boys fantasy diary. The ""sexy"" parts just were not for me, the actual story  and some of the characters did hook me though and I will say that I am glad I did not give up on this series. Overall I would recommend this series with the side note that I personally will be much less likely to read or listen to anything else by this author do to the overwhelming number of and total lack of quality of the ""sexy"" bits.,Wow! I really enjoyed Haven. Misty really penned a great story. Ellory did a great job giving David and the girls life. Five stars all around! I highly recommend it to anyone!,Omg they have a Lusty Argonian! And he gets the medicine from a Kajit. Just got to watch out for the moon sugar lol,I love the story! Great character development. This was the first time listening to something like this.,You cannot go wrong with this box set. Nine books for one credit is amazing. Good story and ending. Read the adventured of David.,,David is a survivor. Born decades after the collapse, his is a life of lonely wandering. As the first winter in this new world of dangerous monsters sets, he finds a place to bunk down for the season. But David has no idea that he is about to be forced to change the course of his entire life."
Flirting with Monsters,"Action & Adventure,Fantasy,Paranormal",Romance,"Book 1 review:,I really enjoyed this listen! I found it an interesting and unique RH urban fantasy with lots of action and twists and tuns. I also love that the relationships are progressing at different speeds, leaving romantic suspense while still enjoying some steamy scenes! The FMC is also badass and her guys are all well-defined characters and each one is unique. I can't wait to find out what happens next with these characters!,,The narration was fantastic! Vanessa Moyen and Aiden Snow are both favorites of mine and they did not disappoint.,,Book 2 review:,Another fantastic book in this series! It was interesting and unique with lots of action and twists and tuns. There are some great steamy scenes as well, and I can't wait to find out what happens next with these characters!,,Book 3 review:,Another fantastic book in this series! It was interesting and unique with lots of action and plot twists. I adore these characters and can't wait to see what happens in book 4.,,Book 4 review:,An ending worthy of this wonderful series! It was entertaining with plenty of action. Sometimes ending a series can drag a bit as everything gets tied up, but Eva kept the intrigue up from start to finish. I am sad to say goodbye to these characters, but they were given a worthy ending to their tale!,,Quick & Dirty Details:,- Badass FMC,- Reverse Harem,- Urban Fantasy,- Fast Burn & Steamy,- Multi POV,- Fast-paced and Action-packed,Book 1: struggling to see how no one remarked on how damn annoying she is with those stupid lame innuendos she used!! ""Holy hot dragon flys"" "" for the love of sweet baby elephants""."" sweet stinking cheese""..stupid stuff like that... Her creepy ""singing "" that low whispering sound, and the way she (the narrator) dragged the end of her words, ahssss (ass) or yeahhhh (yeah), or s.u.vvvvvv (suv) I rolled my eyes so much they got stuck on at least 3 occasions!!...The female narrator also sucked at male voices, and was even worse at British accents...I also didn't like the way the FL treated the shadow ppl when it came to relationship-like situations,  they were not her play things... I hope this gets better and she matures!!,****UPDATE ****,It  did not get better, by book 4, I wanted the bad ppl to go ahead and get the FMC!! SHE WAS SO STUPID, ANNOYING, IMMATURE, SELF-ABSORBED... it can go on and on.... the way she made decisions, and used those lame ass jokes and dry sense of humor even when the situation called for the EXACT OPPOSITE!!!... That made the story unrealistic bc she always escaped using that tactic. ....,She slept with everyone, even the one that doesn't respect her, or care enough about her or put her in harms way for his own sake....And the stupid FMC, just justified this by saying yep I have weird taste in men. WHAT?!?! WHAT THE LITERAL ACTUAL Fu**?!?!?!? Do ppl really want to read about weak women like that who say they're strong, but let men and sexual feelings control how the think, feel, and act??,Such a shame this book had real potential. Oh and in case I hadn't made it clear WORST FEMALE NARRATOR EVER!!!!! GOOD LORD, I NEVER EVER WANT TO HEAR HER VOICE AGAIN!!!!,Book 4 ended so corny, what upsets me is that I l've,tried to update my opinion after each book but audible won't post it!! shameful!!,,I got the whole series thinking if the reviews are so good why not right?!? ü§î,Book 1: For me it went too fast for the steamy scene and then it just became predictable.,Book 2: it had its moments but 1/2 way through the book I just lost interest it became complicated and messy.,Book 3: I won‚Äôt start this one I wanted something to keep me busy the 12 hrs I work but this series just didn‚Äôt cut it for me.,The Narrators are good, the story had some potential but over all I would say 3 1/2 star ‚≠êÔ∏è,It's just a fun ride. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a very good wheel. All the men feel different and have their strengths. It's a medium to slow burn. Sex happens before feelings, which I appreciated. Excellent sex positivity.,,The FMC is strong without hiding her feelings. She's competent, but has her limits and knows when to quit. It has enemies to lovers vibes starting in book 2 with one of the men and their story is the slowest burn, and easy to root for without feeling like they should just get over it and jump each other already.,,Lots of action and adventure. It's more action than romance. It's monsters pulling various  heists and just a lot of fun.,,The worst thing I can say is that it can be a bit repetitive and felt a little too long, but that was such a minor concern compared to how much I loved the characters.,I listened to each of these books as they were released. My reviews were voluntary.,,Shadow Thief - 5 stars,,I'm going to love this new series. Sorsha is a great character. She is determined to free all the supernatural creatures she can from the rich collectors who buy them on the black market. One particular night she does her usual break-in and frees various shadow monsters by giving them shadows to escape through and then cutting them an escape route in their cages. She is astonished to find a separate room with three huge cages in it that contain?? Unfortunately, she sets off an alarm and after hastily freeing - whatever they are - she torches the place and manages to make her own escape. Same ole, same ole. Until she wakes up the next morning to find herself the proud, er, owner of three huge shadowmen. Apparently she saved them and now they were determined to repay her, whether she wanted them to or not.,,So starts Sorsha's adventures with Thorn, Snap, and Ruse. Thorn is brawn, Snap has the look of a sun god, and Ruse is, well, Ruse is an incubus. A very tasty looking incubus and he needs, er. to replenish his energy. Sorsha finally gives in, I mean a girl needs some lovin' every now and then and who better than an incubus? It seems the guys have sort of misplaced their boss, Omen. Well, actually he was captured before they were, and not by a collector. Sorsha agrees to use her contacts to help them find him. Read what happens for yourself. Enjoy.,,Twilight Crook ‚Äì 5 stars,,Lots of action in the second book of the series. Grab book one first so you know what's going on. Sorsha is sticking with her shadowkind lovers, even if she has to put up with their newly-liberated boss's attitude. Omen is not at all convinced that she can be trusted to stick with the so-called ""monsters"" that many humans shun. Not that all humans even know of their existence. He also doesn't believe that her puny human body equips her to fight with them. He seems to love devising little ""tests"" to try to make her admit that she can't hang. Yeah, not gonna happen. It appears that Sorsha may have talents even she is unaware of. As things start to heat up in the conflict of human vs shadowkind, Sorsha does a little heating up of her own. When her human allies start to turn against her, she becomes even more determined to prove her worth. Then one of ""her"" shadowkind disappears, now she is really mad...,,Dusk Avenger ‚Äì 5 stars,,Filled with action and romantic encounters with the shadowkind. Sorsha is still out to destroy the Company of Light, but mostly she wants to find and save Snap. She feels responsible for his capture, believing she didn't do enough to reassure him that his devourer form didn't change the way she feels about him. The crew heads to Chicago first and then to Austin where they will make some discoveries about Sorsha's past. Sorsha's power over fire continues to grow and she worries that sometimes it controls her instead of her controlling it. Some new allies will join the group during their journey.,,Things are really going to change at the end of the book. An unexpected foe will surface and a trusted member of the group will change his opinion of Sorsha. Can you say ""cliffhanger""? Bah.,,Dark Champion ‚Äì 5 stars,,Sorsha is soooooo not happy to discover herself in a dark, damp place chained to a lumpy bed with her hellhound, shadowkind lover staring at her. She does finally get to find out about Omen's servitude to the shadowkind's Highest. He can finally be free of them if he just takes her to them and drops her off to her death. When Thorn shows up and is willing to fight his boss to save her, she can't bear to see either of them hurt and tells Omen she will go willingly to the Highest. He decides that maybe if they can defeat his old pal Tempest that maybe the Highest will leave her alone. No pressure.,,Sorsha and her allies will have to use all their tricks to try to stop the Sphinx's plans to kill off both humans and shadowkind. Sorsha fights to keep her fire under control so she doesn't inadvertently make the dire prediction made about her come true but if it means keeping her guys safe, she is not not afraid to burn the world down.,passing a kidney stone is a better use of your time than listening to this. Just pass on this not worth a credit.,I personally adore reverse harem stories but the only thing that irked be about this book was how the main female protagonist was a tad juvenile at times. I personally dislike when female protagonists ‚Äústick their tongue out‚Äù or say outlandish silly phrases instead of cussing because it gives the character a childish feel, and that mixed with the smuttiness broke the emersion for me. I understand that‚Äôs just what the author gave to the character to make her stand out so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. The story is well written, very detailed and I still enjoyed it all the way through. One of my favorite high points in the last book and one of my favorite book endings so far as a novice adult bookie<3,There is a very good reason why you get all 4 books for a credit... You figure it out..,ok so the girl doesn't learn to properly wield or control her powers unless it's in the last hour of the last book. with 4 lovers there is not nearly enough spice, and way too much angst. ok everyone has problems, ok everyone has past trauma, but why did it take 3 1/2 books for anyone and everyone to come to terms with their past. the story gets really repetitive in that they are all too damaged to do anything but rely on the girl who can basically only set herself on fire until the 3 minutes of fighting she has to set someone else on fire or die. why train her at all? just throw her into a fight and get something done. the girl also sings 80s songs a line or two at a time, but replaces the words with whatever is relevant to what she is currently doing, but the narrator clearly has no idea what the song is supposed to be or what it should sound like so they just come out like she has melted her brain and is chanting nonsense to herself. and let's talk about how her biggest enemy is not the enemy it's a sprinkler system...so you can basically take her out with a good spray bottle, like an unruly cat, but she is the most feared being ever...I'm terrified...no really I'm in awe of her magnificent power that she can't use without cooking herself and can be thwarted with a bucket of water. I did finish the book mostly because I liked the male characters, but it was hard to get through and I fell asleep several times trying to listen to it.,I like the story but man when will we have two people reading one do the males and female do all the women.. not one read a chapter then they try to make make or woman voices when you ALREADY HAVE TWO! Ugh.. when will someone catch on this is just awful!,This box set is worth a credit , it will have you glued with the very detailed description by Eva Case,Book 1 Audio book review,,.

They all have a tall order to do , find and destroy the Shadow kind . Lots of Action and what everyone likes a very happy ending .,Vanessa Moyen, Aiden Snow Performance is great. They did this story Justice. Their voices brought the characters to life.,,,Noted book 3 is 5 ‚≠êÔ∏ès but as an average the box set is a 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è for me!,Here is a breakdown of all the books:,Book 1- This book world builds well and it set up as a mystery to go with everything else! I still have some unchecked boxes of my own with this story so I couldn‚Äôt wait to listen to book 2!,Book 2- Book 2 gives us more action, more mystery and more sexy time!! I enjoyed the adventure and I am looking forward to book 3!,Book 3- My favorite one yet! You get sexy time, action, answers, and a cliffhanger!,Book 4- The end of a series always brings mixed emotions. This one had plenty of action, answers and gasping moments. It is sad to say goodbye to these characters but I am happy to see a flash forward at the end of the book!,Flirting with Monsters by Eva Chase,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è üå∂ üå∂ üå∂,4 books in one and I listened to the complete audiobook. The narrators are fantastic. The speed of the audio was perfect, and their voices were just brilliant.,Sorcha and her shadowkind are just brilliant to read. Sorcha's ability to take 80s song lyrics and mix them up, Snaps the devourer innocence and excitement of anything new and edible. Ruse the succubus is a constant, steady support for Sorcha, Thorn the winged gentleman of old and so loyal. Omen the hellhound with his fiery temper and control. They all try to keep shadowkind safe from a group of mercenaries trying to destroy them all. A twist and turn hunting the leaders leads to shocking finds and love.,A big thumbs up!,,This is my second attempt at the story. I originally bought the first book and never made it to the end then bought the box set without realising I‚Äôd already DNFed the first, but decided to give it another try now I‚Äôd wasted more money on it. The female narrator just makes it boring for me, I think the story is supposed to be upbeat and exciting and the narrator just doesn‚Äôt fit so again I DFNed it.,This series contains four books, all of which form one continuous story so I will review each one individually.,,1 Shadow Thief - This is a paranormal reverse harem story that is told from multiple perspectives and is, I think, the start of an unusual, original and enjoyable series. There are four main characters, Sorsha, a human whom we are told was raised by a shadow kind after her parents were murdered that is until her new carer was also murdered by humans hunting the shadow kind.,,Since then Sorsha has become a bit of a vigilante, rescuing the shadow kind, some would call monsters from the humans who collect and cage them. The other three main characters are higher shadow kind who she rescues during a burglary at the start of the book, Ruse an incubus, Thorn well at first we're not sure what Thorn is we just know he has great strength, and Snap a devourer who can read items and absorb information from them. After they are rescued they decide they owe Sorsha a debt of protection and they follow her home where they introduce themselves to her and vow their protection, it's protection she doesn't really want. Once she hears their story of how they were captured, why they are together and about Omen the higher shadow kind who hired them she insists on helping them find and rescue Omen.,,There is non-stop action which starts with the burglary when she first rescues the guys and carries on from there. All types of supernaturals are featured in this story, including her pet dragon, which is full of action, drama, excitement, danger, and even some sexy times, overall, an enjoyable listen/read.,,2 Twilight Crook - Sorcha's still with her shadow kind lovers. But a fourth ""Monster"" Omen has now joined the group but as yet he's still on the fringes.,,Omen isn't sure Sorcha can be trusted to stick with them, he doesn't trust humans but is that what Sorcha is? The monsters' existence isn't known to all humans, and he wonders if her delicate human body is equipped to be with them and so devises little tests but she's staying put.,,The conflict between the human and shadow kind is escalating and then her human allies turn against her! Then one of her shadow kind disappears.....,,Sorsha learns that there are some things about herself she didn't know, this helps to fuel her determination to free all monsters no matter what her personal cost, then when she is betrayed she's even more determined to defeat the baddies. The story moved at a good pace, there are many passionate moments as well as so many close calls as she has to decide whom she can trust and whom she can't. She and her Monsters are fierce and devoted to their cause and fortunately are able to find some unexpected allies but with one of her own still missing how will they cope? Will they find Snap?,,3 Dusk Avenger - I don't think things will ever be easy for Sorsha and her guys. The surprises just keep on coming and not all of them could be considered good. They are still determined to find and rescue Snap, but will he be the same after his captors have done with him? But they discover that The Company of Light is much more of a problem than they first thought, it's larger and has a farther reach than anyone could have expected. Sorsha is trying to master her power and is searching for answers about who she is, why she has powers and who were her parents?,,The author covers a lot of ground in this book as Sorsha and the guys try to enlist the help of more shadow kind allies along the way. Thankfully Omen's relationship with Sorsha has evolved he seems to genuinely want to help her master her powers and has cut back on the snark and insults. Things seem to be going in their favour when the author throws us the biggest surprise yet, the ending totally surprised me and left me wondering where they stand and what else Eva has in store for our gang,,4 Dark Champion - Well, this is the book which will give us the answers, will Sorsha defeat the Company of Light? Will she and the guys save the world from the threat of the Sphynx? Will the Highest allow her and Omen to survive? All these answers and more are contained in this book. The conclusion is perfect, the excitement level is high, and my heart was in my mouth more than once! Sorsha and her lovers take down the baddies, and the guys finally put to rest some of the issues that were plaguing them from their pasts.,,I loved the connection, devotion and depth of loyalty and love this group's dynamic contained. Faced with odds that far outnumber them, their vastly different personalities and talents were brought to bear to defeat their enemies, and in so doing save not only Shadowkind but humans too.,,This entertaining series is by turns thrilling, exciting, sexy, heartwarming and hilarious, it will take you on an emotional, exciting rollercoaster ride, so sit down, hold on tight and enjoy!,,The narration of this series is beautifully done by Vanessa Moyen and Aiden Snow, their performance is perfect and could not be improved upon. They both seem to have each character down perfectly and their narration certainly added to my enjoyment of these books.,,I was given this audiobook as a gift and am voluntarily writing my review.,,I read these as they came out and enjoyed them then.,Being able to listen to the whole story again, brilliantly narrated and for only one purchase is a real treat and shouldn't be missed.,,Interesting story but the ages of, mainly the female characters, do not match their stated ages. Sorcha and Vivi are stated to be 27 and almost 30, yet both act like they are 16. the stubbornly desperate need to be are part of something exciting to the point where they willingly and obtusely walk directly into danger as if there are no consequences like their own mortality is one of their biggest detractors and makes me hate the more and more, that and the 'snark' üôÑ.,Of the narration, As usual, Vanessa reads far too quickly I've had to play this at 85% speed again. This is the 2nd boxset I've had where she does this weird talking of songs, instead of even attempting to match the tune of said song she continues to do this odd cadence. I  obhorred it in the last boxset so much I DNF, I have persevered with this one but it is a struggle. On the plus side she does read each character with their own distinct voice and does this really well. Unfortunately, Aiden, does not do this and there is very little distinction between any of the characters he is voicing and obviously doesnt come close to matching the style of voices or accents used by Vanessa. As this series has 4 MMCs, when he reads their chapters, I can't tell exactly who is meant to be speaking, unless he specifically states their name, which makes it a confusing listen and adds to my frustration with this work.,As for the actual story, there is an awful lot of unnecessarily repeated exposition I still have over 6 hrs left to go (extended due to reducing the speed of playback) and it is becoming a serious chore. I would love to be able to rate it higher, but I simply can't in its current state.,one of the things I love about Eva Chases RH books is that the heroine always owns her sexuality and doesn't make any apologies for it.  this box set combines the romance, angst, story and spice perfectly. with each of her four shadow creatures having very different personalities it makes for a good mix of guys who show devotion in different ways. the narrator's do a great job with their performances of each character. I thoroughly enjoyed the series.,My 2 previous reviews of this book were not approved, so I will try to be polite. I  don't see this as a steamy romance, I felt the main male character comes across as a predator, and this behaviour seems to be portrayed as acceptable in the book. Listening to this actually made me uncomfortable, so I returned it. I thought it was just me, but my 23yr old daughter had heard some of it and she also felt the same way and was pleased that I was no longer listening to it,,what a great world. well not great, people and shadowkind are killing each other and stuff. but the way the series is written I fell right into the world and it's characters,oh and steamy hot hot, but also tender smutty moments,4.7 stars,I‚Äôll be honest if I hadn‚Äôt gotten the boxset for one audible credit I probably wouldn‚Äôt have finished the series,It started out ok, I liked the premise, ruse, snap and thorn were charming and adorable with their non human ways and at first my only issue was I just wanted more spice and some more dimension to their romance or something,But then we‚Äôre are introduced to omen ‚Ä¶ who I disliked from the start, he calls her disaster that‚Äôs his pet name for her, lovely right? hes just mean and snide and I don‚Äôt like how she is with him and I don‚Äôt like how he is with her, i dont know if it was meant to be a bad boy or enemies to lovers type thing but it never sat right for me and then he did something terrible to her and she apologised to him and it was just gross the whole thing,Then everybody seem to lose faith in themselves and get insecure like there hadn‚Äôt been enough of that just yeah,Was also kinda hoping for more of a redemption arc for the humans but you know,But yeah series started off pretty good reminded me of Katie Mays demon sworn but by the end I was cursing, rolling my eyes and listening at 1.5 speed and skipping parts because I was so over it,loved it, highly entertaining and fantastically written, narrators were excellent in bringing the characters to life. even better was all 4 books together. üìö üòç"

Can't Hurt Me,"Personal Success,Self Help,Self Improvement","Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","The audio book is unique in that in between reading chapters, the narrator/co-author interviews David. Overall, it's interesting as a break between chapters. I'm actually returning the audisobook and buying the book instead because there are exercises after every chapter, photos referenced, and there was no audiobook supplement. Feel like that was a major miss that should be rectified for this audiobook.,I really enjoyed the first half, maybe the first 2/3 of this book.  Mr. Goggins is inspiring.  The difficulties he overcame make him an incredible role model.,,But as we got into the ultra marathon stories and the pull-up stories, I seriously began to wonder if the man was a masochist.  I do not want to be like that.  Not ever.  Yes, goals are important, but I will not sacrifice my body and literally exercise myself to the grave.  I'm not into massive blood blisters, pushing until collapse, hospitalization, and near-death just to be the best at something.  Kudos to him for being able to push that far, but honestly, I don't see the merit.,,I would rather live a long, healthy, well-rounded life.  I set goals, I achieve them.  I am exceptional at everything I do, but there is absolutely no reason to sacrifice my body to be the very best at one single thing.,,I struggled to finish the book once we reached the ultra-marathon stage.  I no longer wished to be like Mr. Goggins.  Do I still admire him? Absolutely.  Was the story compelling? Yes.  Would I read it again?  Probably not.,,Mr. Goggins, if by any chance you ever read this review, please know you are awe-inspiring.  Not completely what I want to emulate, but that's just me.  Thank you for the book.  Go on with your bad self.,I first heard about David Goggins through Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast. I‚Äôve listened to his interview with him at least a dozen times. Through following David Goggins on social media, I learned he was writing a book. After much anticipation, the audiobook is finally out! I‚Äôve already pre ordered my kindle copy from Amazon once the book is officially released dec, 4. I have no doubt that this audio version will be on repeat. This guy has put so many mantras in my head that constantly motivate me to ‚Äúget after it.‚Äù I‚Äôve even considered getting a tattoo of ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù (something that David explains) somewhere on my body to always remember to be unstoppable and be hungry for more. I hope his words will inspire you to find out something you don‚Äôt already know about yourself. They have for me. David, if you‚Äôre reading this, thank you! You‚Äôve certainly made an impact on my life!,The most powerful people are not the ones who control others, it is those who can control themselves. Thank you David for sharing your story. - @Ricky_Arenas,I'm only half way thru this listening to this book, its simply life changing. David tells it like it is, no more BS excuses for whatever your using them for..Thank you for putting this book out here to help us SIR,Amazing audiobook unlike any other I have heard. While it is an audiobook, it also offers elements of a podcast! Truly engaging and forced me to look at my problems and challenges in life in a very different way.,I liked the format of this audio book.  It combines Mr. Goggins himself, Mr. Skolnick, a narrator/collaborator, Mr. Goggins‚Äô autobiography, his self analysis, a podcast format, and guidance for readers who wish to improve their lives.  The interaction between Mr. Goggins and Mr. Skolnick adds a fresh element to the entire presentation.  Clearly Mr. Goggins has confronted and overcome significant obstacles in his lifetime and can serve as an inspiration to all of us.  That said, not everyone will feel the need to take self improvement to the nth degree, as did Mr. Goggins.  I was somewhat put off by his drive to compete constantly.  It didn‚Äôt seem like Mr. Goggins‚Äô striving to be the best left much time for a personal life.  But his path doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, though aspects of it surely do.  The story of his life still has much value for readers and listeners.  I‚Äôm glad I listened to his book.,I didn‚Äôt like how the story was told.,With a constant focus on disadvantage points, not following a cronologica order, and constantly inviting people to push themself, even with injuries in their bodies.,The end is funny, with the author being so good that even his god has to re-evaluate the plans made for him.,Discipline wins over motivation. Thousands have said it before Goggins. There is nothing new in this book.,,Holding yourself accountable. David Goggins is an American Hero. I am grateful to him and others for serving our country and fighting for our freedom. Thank you David for telling it like it is and showing everyone else that they are their own hero, they are held accountable. Celebrate your small successes and get after it, just understand it will be the hardest thing you have ever done because you are in your own way. No excuses, doesn't matter who you are. Period.,Retired Navy Chief, loved this audiobook! Listened to this over a few day period every morning while taking my older kids to school as well. The mind is what truly separates a person from being where they are. The closing is the most true and inspired me to continue the growth path I'm On!,I believe we may have met, during a Pressure on the Force interview, and I knew Beck as well!,As a minority as well, we need more great people to show the actual diversity that people of color can do as well, and stop worrying about what their peers may think and live life according to what the creator has intended us to do!,I'm actually terrified now, thinking that on judgement day, did I do enough, for enough, and go above my levels that God knows I could endure.,Navy Chief, Navy Pride!,Only at chapter 10 but I couldn't wait any longer. first introduced to DG via Joe Rogans podcast, and since then I've been really interested in his story, and more importantly his mindset. We can all achieve this ... but we need to step off the marshmallow clouds, and be honest with ourselfs. You need to want change for more than just motivational sake, you need to want it because you deserve it. DG, Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson have become father figures for me. Thank you DG for sharing your insight.,mike,I‚Äôve made a mistake believing that this book is about training your mind to be strong, having a different perspective on life and get me motivated and inspired. However it is only 10% this and 90% of David story which is cool but it‚Äôs so unnecessary detailed and definitely not right to the point. It‚Äôs even describing the cookies he ate. For army training freaks, this book is perfect but I was under the impression it would give me a general idea of keeping my mind strong and not just describing army training into every single little detail possible.,I heard many good reviews about this book and rating of 4.9 on Audible did help too (also the fact the book was in the bestsellers), but I was very disappointed by the second hour of listening. I still gave it a chance but it sounded to me that it's nothing but author's ego boost.,And come on, running on broken legs? This made me laugh if anything, I mean RUN on BROKEN legs?? Seriously? And all this followed by an interview with the narrator telling how ""Hundreds of people are running with injuries"" - how is this a good idea? If people will start following this example, they will end up getting injured for life! And I'm telling this as a very active person myself.,All this pushing through pain, ""earning"" the right to watch TV, destroy other people's mind - is there anything in this person's life that he genuinely enjoys? That makes him happy?,,I found this book extremely sad. And it sounded like the person who written it is captured in his own torturing set of mind.,Ok before I say anything negative, this book has some fine points about discipline and some amazing anecdotes about persistence which truly are (if true) mind-bending. I am not denying, in any way, this man's physical abilities as a human or mental toughness. That is, in fairness, indisputable.,,However, I found the writing in this book is hilarious. It's so Alan Partridge. He keeps saying (especially in the excruciating brodude back-and-forth parts with the ghost writer on the audiobook) ""I'm not a hero"", to the extent that I believe he very much doubts that he is not a hero, and possibly polishes a big statue of himself in his house with ""A Hero"" written on it . I found it really grating during the hell week stage, where he basically takes credit for the work of his team, as if his steely determination coasted the rest of the guys through. He just can't believe himself.,,Also, as mentioned, the back and forth with the ghostwriter/narrator has to be heard to be believed. The guy has his tongue down the back of Goggins' trousers for the whole thing. He's so slimy and sycophantic. At one point, after Goggins had finished describing one of the movies he likes, Platoon I think (seriously these parts are inane and insane. Goggins also describes the storyline to the movie Rocky at one point, so buckle up for that one) the narrator says something like ""that's some knowledge right there"". Great. Thanks for that.,,Anyway, perhaps it's a cultural thing, constant self-praise is a bit grating to me, but if it doesn't bother you there are some amazing stories about brutal training schedules and physical feats to keep you entertained.Sorry if I was too negative there.I have just finished ""Man's Search for Meaning"" which sees a man go through a concentration camp and lose everything and there wasn't one self-congratulatory note. It is humble throughout. That to me is totally amazing.,Although in the title I have said this is a self help book, I would really call it a self awakening book.,This book is not for everyone, as you read or listen, one of 2 things will happen. You will either start to feel that there are too many challenges ahead and take the easy way out and go back to watching telly.,Or, if you are worthy, you will re-ignite the flame you had as a kid to just get up and get after it.,The story of David Goggins life is inspirational, bit what he is doin is simply opening a door to discovery of yourself.,Best listen in ages, shed tears of realisation whilst reflecting between his and my own life, and wasted potential past.,This is the best book I‚Äôve heard in a long time. It really helps to put things into perspective if you think you‚Äôre having a bad day! To go through all that he has and still have the ability to be driven to the success that David Goggins has achieved is truly remarkable. If you have a goal you want to achieve, if you‚Äôre stuck in a rut, or if there are obstacles preventing you being who you want to be, then this book is the book for you!,The icing on the cake are the short interviews that take place at the end of each chapter. Insightful and a brilliant concept. Rather than being short-changed like with a lot of audio books where the resources aren‚Äôt readily available, this gives you more than reading it would. Awesome!,loved every minute of this book . Just finished it and starting it again alot of lessons to learn what a beast of a man proving anything in life is possible if you put your mind to it,I‚Äôve listened to David Goggins on countless podcasts and videos but this book went even deeper. Truly makes you question how you‚Äôre living, your potential and encourages you to go out and pursue it. BRILLIANT!,loved the book finished in record time , narrator was great even tho I was annoyed it wasn't goggins . the moment he ran with two broken legs WOW !,Raw, honest, spiritual, true, transcending.,Explore yourself and the depths of your soul as David Goggins' story unfolds offering precious tools and kindling. And now, when life gives you kindling make damn sure to use it and start some longlasting  fire.,I enjoyed the first third of this book. Apart from the swearing, which for me wasn't needed, I thought the story was real value. Unfortunately after listening to one torturous event after another I was eventually worn down and did not want to listen to someone putting themselves consistently through physical torment, deliberately. Perhaps I was missing the point but I thought that I had got the point in the first part of the book, that is - push through and don't give up, don't think your best is your best because you always have more in the tank. I also lost the flow of the challenges he tried to set his readers, which might have been easier to follow in the hard copy version rather than audio.,,There is no doubt the man is remarkable and did some remarkable things but the story for me was a bit like a trip to the dentist, not a fun experience, you are glad when its over but somewhat worth the the visit.,This man's life is truly amazing and to see where he came from and all that he has accomplished is an inspiration.,Very engaging and great post chapter conversations with Goggins and Skolnick.,If you listen to this story and am not inspired to maximise your life there is truly something wrong with you!,This book has nothing to do with mental toughness. This book is glazed over biography(yes biography because he has a ghost writer), running and a human pushing himself past his initial physical thresholds at great costs and then essentially becomes addicted to stretching to 'heal himself'. It's boring. This book fails on all points, the hashtag suggestions are cringey and the podcast feel between chapters is NOT my jam. I finished this book on 1.8x speed after about the half way point. It could not finish soon enough.,Amazing! Life changing! Train to be uncommon amongst uncommon people! I did not want this to end!,What an astonishing, humbling, and elating book. Goggins moves the reader from a hell most humans will never have the misfortune to experience, through countless moments of unimaginable success and crushing failure, to a place of hard earned peace and even communion with God. Every passage drenched in the authenticity and vulnerability that comes from having run every mile he speaks of.,I loved the realness and intensity of every minute of this journey, feel blown away by the completeness of the book, and wonder how many of MY fears I'll be willing to face to discover who I really am.,Explore this insane and extraordinary book.,This book will shake your core and challenge the way you live your life. Start listening and get ready to work harder then you ever have before,A PDF of all the challenges would be great or bookmarks that link you back to them.,Incredible from start to finish. The commentary in between chapters and at various other points really adds to the whole book and breaks it up perfectly. It's a roller coaster of emotions and you can't help but want to be a better person once you've finished reading.,A have a mixed response to this book. I liked the format of the book. Regarding content, it pushes for extremes. The will power is admirable but the costs to relationships and the body are also real. It concerns me that vulnerability is equated here with derogatory references to ‚Äòhaving a vagina‚Äô. There is reference to the author facing an new chapter of parenthood but no reference thereafter to his child or being a father. Everything is about using the mind to push past perceived limits, such as overcoming physical feats.,Best inspirational Audible!,Can't Hurt Me - David Goggins book started me on the right path to saving myself, he saved me from an early death, the way I was going.,I am 62, I had Type 2 Diabetes, obese at 99kg and eating all sorts of crap food and drinking every day. I was very unfit. I came across David Goggins on Youtube and started watching all his videos. I made a commitment to myself and  I got off my ass and started getting up at 5 am, going into my gym space, working out on my wife's elliptical and listening to ""Can't Hurt Me"". I couldn't do ten minutes on that thing, without thinking I was going to die! Long story short, I finished his book while slogging it out on the elliptical. Two weeks later, I completed a half marathon on the elliptical and now do one every couple of days. Two months and I'm not stopping now, it's hard but I am now onto lifting weights, listening to other Audibles while I work out and starting to look like I did 22 years ago. I eat less and no alcohol or junk food, I have lost 10kg and my Type 2 has gone, cholesterol normal and BP 128/86.,,Thank you and Roger that!"

The Power of Now,"Personal Development,Meditation,Self Help,Personal Growth,Spiritual Enlightenment","Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","This book caused me to realize how much my mind (ego) is generally in control of me. I had studied a number of meditative teachings, and already had the ideas in my head, but it was this book that catalyzed a clear transformation in me. There were moments where Tolle's voice (as the narrator) caused me to observe my own presence. My mind wrestled with the book, and at several points it wanted to toss the book aside, dismissing it as new-age spiritual hoo-ha (and there may be points where you try to dismiss it this way, also). But in retrospect, as I  live my life, it is impossible to ignore the essential truth that Tolle has put words to. Slowly, the moments are increasing where I feel liberated from my mind's patterns of control and obsession with past/future. This was one of the most powerful books I have encountered.,Eckhart Tolle's work, The Power of Now, is filled with wisdom, inspiration, and practical advice from beginning to end.  He shows clearly how progress in the evolution of human consciousness is absolutely necessary for survival of life on this planet, and that it is up to each one of us to change our perception of the world in which we live if that progress is to take place.  Tolle also shows how our tendency to dwell in the past and future obscures the present moment.  In so doing, we fail to see what is necessary right now, thus we make wrong choices and decisions which lead to untold suffering for self and others.  This work is a recipe for true happiness and if everyone followed the advice contained therein the world would be a happier place to live in.  I have listened to it so many times now I have lost count.  If I were shipwrecked on a desert island and I could take only one book, this would be it!,Before I buy it I read all reviews, and the negative ones made me hesitate. Finally I decided to try it - and I'm so glad I did!! This book is now my all time favorite - other spirituality, self-help or philosophy books seem so unenlightened, so incomplete. A must-read for anyone with big questions, big problems, or simply not 100% happy (does this leave any one of us out?) You will love this book - if a single book can lead you to enlightenment and can elevate your consiousness above everyday problems, negativity and conflicts, then this is it!,,This is a book about spirituality, and if you choose to hear it this way, God. And at the same time I believe an atheist could listen and identify with it. In fact one of the phenomenal things about this book is that an atheist, agnotstic, Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist could all sit with this book and identify with it in their own individual way, be it identifying with the individual, their god, or higher spiritual state of being.,,While the book is along the spirituality line, it really reframes religions, all religions as part of the same whole. And he quotes and discusses the concept of &#8220;god&#8221; in many different religions, but ties them all back to a single concept. And specifically he discusses the teachings of Christianity and dispels, in an unbelievably eloquent way many of the misinterpretations of the original teachings that are prevalent today,,But the book isn&#8217;t about God, it&#8217;s simply about one&#8217;s self, the author just pulls together western religion, eastern religion, and individual awareness in one framework and shows, with examples from various religions, and mostly from individual experience, how they all point back to the same thing.,,If spirituality is not something you are interested in, and in fact it is only very minimally what I am interested in, you could as easily read and identify with this book on the level of a personal psychology guide. I believe that virtually anyone interested in their own well being will find that this book speaks to them on a level that makes sense for them in their life. To accomplish this is a truly magnificent feat, and the author has my deepest respect for accomplishing this seemingly impossible task.,,,If you could sum up The Power of Now in three words, what would they be?,Uplifting, encouraging and enlightening.,Who would you have cast as narrator instead of Eckhart Tolle?,At first I had an issue with the narration because the voice was very hypnotic. It took me a while to be able to listen and remain alert. A soothing voice is ok, but not when there's so much to take in. Honestly, I almost kept falling asleep. It really took a while to build up tolerance and be able to follow along while remaining alert. And this is not to say it was boring ‚Äî not at all, just very, very soothing, but not in a good way for the purpose at hand.,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,Practically every sentence and every word.,Any additional comments?,While I appreciate the way the audiobook conveys the breaks and/or pauses between chapters or even within the chapters themselves (something I feel all audiobooks should have, by the way), the tone used to indicate these pauses is an extremely high pitched, echoing tone. It literally hurt my ears throughout the entire book. And it distracted a lot from whatever came after it (because it echoes in the background as the story continues). This is why the performance of this title gets only a one star. This is really a book best left to traditional reading and not listening to.,What was one of the most memorable moments of The Power of Now?,The Power Of Now is toward the top of my list of books that make you think (or in this case, stop thinking). In short, it is somewhat Buddhist philosophy that goes like this: The past is gone and only exists in your memories. The future only exists in your head, as well. The only thing that is real is the present. And, if you would just stop thinking so much about the past and the future, you could enjoy the present. That's pretty much the book in just a few sentences.,Personally, I had a death of a family member as a young teenager that affected me for many, many years after it happened. I really think my life might have been different if someone had explained to me back then that I had the power to just stop thinking about it.,On the other hand, it is silly to think that the past just disappears. For example, a Southern California middle school teacher was recently fired for appearing in a pornographic movie. The film was produced well before she became a teacher. It is clear here that what she did in her past affected both her present and her future. Eckhart Tolle's advice in ""The Power of Now"" might make her present more enjoyable for her personally, but the bottom line is, nobody else is just going to magically forget about her past (career wise, anyway).,But kudos to Eckhart Tolle for not only writing a whole book explaining the benefits of ""stopping to smell the roses,"" but doing so in a masterful way. Used in moderation, the information could benefit much of America, whose unchecked egos have caused much misery and pain.,For anyone interested in ""The Power Of Now,"" I'm going to suggest the book, ""The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"" by Michael A. Singer. It contains some of the same concepts, but, in my opinion, in a kinder and gentler way. Perhaps, it is a little less, ""just stop thinking"" than Eckhart Tolle, but still explains some of the dangers of the unchecked ego fairly well.,It's hard to believe - until you hear it...that Eckhart Tolle can write such brilliant books, but has NO IDEA how to read them out loud! His voice is dull, monotonous, sleep-invoking and downright annoying. Gaps and stops, pauses and falters...will someone please speed up the tape---give that man some Coffee!,My advice would be to buy his books and read them out loud... yourself!,,My advice to Mr. Tolle would be simple...carry on writing your excellent books but please don't commit them to Audio....unless that is you can find a narrator that can do them justice.,,Listen to the audio preview of ANY of his audiobooks on this site and I think you'll get the picture.,,Book content  10/10  :-),Audio Version  2/10  :-(,,,,,My friend recommended this book to me, raved about it.... and given all the changes (for the good) he's made in his life, I figure I would download it. Problem was, the voice reading the book gave me the creeps, seriously I tried a few times to listen to it on a number of occasions to see if the narration either got better or didn't creep me out so much, but it didn't. My friend read the book, not listened to it on audio. I've listened to a few audio books now and this is the only one I couldn't listen to because of that reason. Sorry, I'm sure the message is probably really good!,As a Buddhist, I find an amazing parallel between the teachings of Tolle and the basic sanity of Buddhism.  Thanks to Tolle, I now understand why the glimpses into reality that I have experienced have always faded and not lead to lasting peace - my mind incorporated them into my 'story'.,,Thanks to this reminder, I feel like I am embarking on a spiritual journey that has been sidelined for a very long time by my identification with my mind and my story as it is expressed through past and future.  Although much of the wisdom expressed in this book has been expressed before, at least one new concept, that of the 'Pain Body', is both new (to me) and very useful.,,This book is very inspiring.  After years of confusion and procrastination, Tolle's 'Power of Now' has compelled me to begin my spiritual practice 'now'.,The book was well worth the credit. The concepts and theory behind these works are on the leading edge of humanity trying to figure itself out, even thou heavily based in eastern beliefs. While listening, all the concepts make sense, but in real life as usual, holding or implementing these concepts are difficult in the practical world. The concepts are presented well, but if you have never been introduced to them, further readings of his works and others is highly recommended. Getting a hold of oneself is the key to this and its sound advice, worth the read. I enjoyed this but after first listening to the ""New Earth"" as my first in his series I see that the same concepts and sometimes the same thoughts, just reworded, are repeated over again. Of course he has a good message and of course he is selling books, in just the same way as the other self help gurus. So far, I am doing well with the 4 E's I have listened to, and can listen again at any time, unless something comes out totally new. If you want a broad summary and compilation of his works, go for the ""New Earth"" which touches on it all. Then if you wish some future enhancement, mind you with some repeating of the same material, then choose this or another of his works. He is a good author, I believe in most of the message, and this book is worth the credit. Thanks E.,Initially not sure whether this would be any good and thought maybe other reviewers were desperately looking for something that the rest of us knew was a bit 1960's and zen like. Maybe they are - maybe not. I don't think I am but I did find this surprisingly inciteful and useful. Lots of really down to earth good advice and good philosophical (and dare I say it) spiritiual food for thought. But to reiterate: useful and pragmatic from the start. Have listened to some bits a few times as it seems to make me think of things slightly differently each time.,The incredible power of this book stems from the simplicity of its teachings. Tolle presents a system so simple and undebiably true that it cannot help but work. I am not so sure I would have taken so much from the written book, so the audiobook is definitely the recommended format to absorb this timeless teaching. If you do only one thing to improve your life, then make that reading this book.,Perhaps I was under a misapprehension when I bought this book - I was expecting something about meditation and the philosophy of living in the present.,Sadly, it turned out to be pseudo-religious with an author that claims lots of answers but can substantiate none of it. He answers with generalisations (the best one was where a voice says something like ""Are any of your claims proven?"" and Tolle replies with ""Do it, and you yourself will be the evidence)"", and when he started banging on about ""energy fields"", ""life energy"", ""energy polarity"", and how women feel pain because of the rape and subjugation of previous generations, I was just laughing at the stupidity.,Now, the one useful point here is the idea of living in the present and not dwelling too much on the future or the past. I really hoped this would elaborate on that area, but to be honest it didn't really move on after the first few chapters.,The performance is ok - Tolle has a calm, steady tone although they have put a bit of an echo on the sound, so it sounds like he's trying to hypnotise you. There is an annoying cymbal that is meant to break the chapters but just sounds a bit silly to me.,So in conclusion, I bought this based on the other rave reviews. I guess others must have a very different view on the subject. Maybe if you want to believe this stuff and don't require real evidence or substance and are happy to trust people on the basis that they claim to know, then you might get on fine with this. Personally I am disappointed - there may be some useful stuff here but it gets drowned out by the unsubstantiated claims.,This book opens the door and gives a glimpse of a world I had not experienced since childhood.  That of living in the present moment.  A beautiful but very indepth read.,This audiobook was great and I genuinely consider it to be life changing.  Tolle's teachings made me realise the root of my anxieties and hence unhappiness.,He gets quite spiritual at times, which doesn't particularly appeal to me, but the overall message is a wonderful one and has made me appreciate 'the now'.,I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the author for producing this book, an amazing, truly life changing experience. I recommend listening to this title in small chunks to really take in the PEARLS of WISDOM. Free yourself from your mind, find your inner happiness.,Eckhart Tolle is an extremely inspiring man.  I love this book and his other books also.  His ideas are great and having implemented some of them already in daily life I feel a lot more positive than I have in the past.  Releasing how far away we are from living life like we should in order to be happy and healthy is amazing.  I'm not sure I could dive in like the author did and live happily homeless but I have definitely taken as much of his advice as I can.  My only slight issue is that his voice is very calming and hypnotic to the point that I found myself getting a little sleepy while listening but that can also be reviewed as positive because he is very easy to listen to.  I would definitely recommend this book.,I completely disagreed with the author right off the bat, he states that when your mind becomes aware of a thought, there is something else beyond the mind that is doing the watching. He goes on to say that between thoughts you are in a state of ‚Äòno mind‚Äô. I would strongly argue that this is merely the first step, what you are actually doing is residing in the ‚Äònothingness OF the mind‚Äô and the self you think is doing the watching, is also a part of the mind. Tolle seems to be under the mistaken impression that simply being aware of your thoughts is ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù. Can't believe this guy actually calls himself a ""Spiritual Teacher"".,,Tolle is essentially promoting mindfulness. Which is fantastic! The problem is that he‚Äôs doing it with unsubstantiated claims and the language of a new age charlatan.  If you are truly interested in mindfulness I highly recommend listening to Abiding in Mindfulness by Joseph Goldstein, it is a much more structured, practical and substantive discourse on the topic. There is also Jack Kornfield's No Time Like The Present and/or Brining Home the Dharma: Awakening right where you are. I suspect Tolle is also familiar with them and this is his attempted to rehash them, cashing in on a wider audience.,,Tolle talks about ‚Äúpain bodies‚Äù as though they are something that exist independently, that‚Äôs just one example of the tosh in this book for those who don‚Äôt know better. I strongly urge anyone considering this book to read an actual Buddhist book instead, you will only find a mishmash of regurgitated self-righteous rubbish here.,,There is also a really annoying echo on the audio, perhaps to cover up how unprofound the ramblings of the author are by making them at least sound ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù and ""authoritative"". The narrator is also super nasally and obviously trying to sound all wise and holier than thou which is very annoying. Seems to be a get rich quick scam that feeds on the impressionable who haven't come across any basic Eastern Thought before.,,Forced my way to the end of chapter 2 before putting my listening time to far better use. The only audible book I couldn't bring myself to finish, ending a 34 book run, it really is that bad. Avoid.,I'd never heard of Eckhart Tolle and downloaded this book on the recommendation of a friend. I was sceptical of someone calling himself a 'spiritual teacher' but willing to be open minded. After listening to maybe 3 hours of this magnum opus my scepticism was proved correct. There is a nugget of wisdom in this book which is essentially no different to the practice of mindfulness - the only moment we have is now so be aware, be present. Er, that's it. I bailed halfway through chapter 3 when I couldn't stand him droning on about the same point in different ways. There is a lot of repetition and a lot of rubbish wrapped up as 'spiritual' guidance. I read afterwards he is a multi-millionaire on the back of this and other books so I suspect he lives in 'clock time', as he disdainfully calls it, a lot more than he advocates other people do. You would be better spending the 7 plus hours required to listen to this doing some mindfulness practice instead.,Would you listen to The Power of Now again? Why?,This was recommended to me as a book I should read. I am glad I did.,The book explains how we rush about in our daily lives, earning money and supposedly living. But how often do you sit and think about what you are doing 'now'.,I have learned to enjoy living in the 'now',To listen to the sounds of nature and actually see nature growing.,There is so much beauty around us.,I would listen to the book again, if only to remind me, if I should forget, to live in the 'now',What was one of the most memorable moments of The Power of Now?,The most memorable part was actually realising that I can listen and be in the present and it is peaceful and calm.,What about Eckhart Tolle‚Äôs performance did you like?,Eckhart's voice is calming. He pauses several times to allow you to take in what he is saying.,Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?,I listened to this book in 2 days. When the author told me to enjoy the moment, to listen, feel and taste the now, I felt that my life is suddenly going to be richer in experiences.,This has proved to be so in many experiences since.,Amazing book and profound message.,The narration is superb and set as a dialogue between Eckhartand his publishers, it's pretty clear lot of care has gone into the audiobook edition and the author voice is calm and clear, almost soothing.,Although this book is highly recommended please be wary that it might be hard to follow on a daily commute as it requires undivided attention. Better heard in the quiet of you abode.,Eckhart has such a soothing and calm voice im so glad it's him reading the book xx,I have read this book several times, and being able to listen to it when i am not in the mood to read but still need the amazing, life changing wisdom is just great.,For anyone who finds life difficult, empty, excessively stressful or lacking, this book is your answer. Not only is it an easy read, you only need to read sections at a time  to feel amazing. Please give this book a chance, because it is your answer to a better life.,This is mostly the secular parts of Buddhism but given modern labels like ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù and ‚ÄúVibrations‚Äù. Unfortunately the author gets lost in these new definitions and comes to some strange and unjustified conclusions.,Don‚Äôt buy this if you have a scientific background, as the loose use of definitions will frustrate you.,Loved this book, It has inspired me. Couldn't stop listening to it had to finish it.,Thank you Eckhart for sharing your wisdom and experiences.  I read the Power of Now a couple years ago, and wanted to re-read it as I was falling into a darker headspace.  I stumbled across the audiobook form and was intrigued with the idea that Eckhart himself narrates it.  I‚Äôm so glad I did.  Hearing these words through his own voice was powerful.  I felt so much more from it, and I know it helped me accept and let go of a lot of resentment that was building.  Listening to this book was like a meditation.  I can‚Äôt recommend it enough!,It is difficult to distill this treasure offered by Tolle in a review. I hope I do not do it a disservice. Suffice to say I will be listening to this again each year and purchasing the text too.,One can tell almost immediately that the author Eckhart Tolle has profound insights into true spiritual Liberation. In fact one could safely say he is most likely permanently dwelling in this ""unmanifested"" state and is doing his best to convey this with love, clarity, and humility. He succeeded.,I recognise (as Tolle said we all will) that we already possess this knowledge, that we already know these truths. We just have to go into ourselves though living fully in the present moment. It sounds simple because it is. This is the torch. We just have to follow his advice.,I have been watching Tolle speaking online since the COVID 19 pandemic hit, so I had already been practising his advice in my life before reading The Power of Now. Since doing so I have found a complete change from my once intense anxiety to a much happier, peaceful, accepting, and calmer self and I intend to continue on doing so until maybe I don't need to ask the question at the very end of the book. It is true that sometimes difficult life situations can be a gift to discovering what we already possess.,Coming from a Buddhist background I can see many parallels. Throughout the book, Tolle briefly and skillfully mentions various spiritual teachers who all point the way to the same truth.,This book does not bog down the listener in flowery language or waste a moment getting into illustrating and exploring why we are as we are, and how we can liberate ourselves from our egoic mind which keeps us trapped in suffering and delusion, that keeps us from our true ""Being"".  Being fully present every moment will bring us home. The power of Now is an instruction to bringing us into the ""unmanifested"", to our real ""Being"" . Some call this state the ""Divine"" , or ""God"". Tolle does this in such a powerful way chapter by chapter.,I did not expect this to be as important as it is. There are things that I need to think about fully, that I don't quite grasp as yet, and I would imagine that is because words are not really adequate. It is more experiential.,When Tolle spoke the last sentence, I wanted to start listening to the whole text again. I did not want it to finish. If we were all fully living in the now, every moment, the world would be the ""unmanifested"" and something to behold.  I love you all. I would strongly recommend this wonderful book.,TYR,Right from the start I felt creeped out. Couldn't relate. Not sure what else to say. I probably could have endured but...,I didn't like the narration the voice and the slow pace of it couldn't get into it,I so wanted to love this, the reviews were good but the narration was very slow and I found it offputting and wasn‚Äôt able to connect with it. I nearly gave up an hour through but stuck with it through to the end but just couldn‚Äôt connect with the narration or the content."
The Psychology of Money,"Investing & Trading,Money Management & Budgeting,Behavioral Finance,Stock Market Psychology,Financial Psychology",Money & Finance,"I‚Äôll save you a few hours of your time. The author invests all his money in index funds. The end.,This book really should be called the philosophy of money. Some good bits of info, more like fun facts than anything else, but overall I didn't feel like I got a lot of value from the book.,Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî money is a complex and, at times, bewildering subject. There‚Äôs so much contradictory information out there. It can be quite overwhelming to hear all of that info and try to make sense of it, based on our own situations.,,Rather than try to provide another set of so-called ‚Äúcan‚Äôt lose‚Äù strategies for managing money, here, Housel seeks to show readers that success with money is a soft skill filled with lots of nuances. Though that may sound daunting at first, I can assure you he doesn‚Äôt just leave readers out to dry. No, instead, he provides countless new ways of thinking about money that allow readers to see their financial situations in new lights.,,Sure, that may also sound a bit nebulous on the surface, but trust me ‚Äî it will all make sense if/when you pick this one up. Some of those new ways of looking at money include ideas such as: different people‚Äôs life experiences lead to vastly different views about money; the hardest financial skill to acquire is to learn to stop moving the goalposts and eventually become content with what we have; and protecting the downside is probably the most important thing when it comes to managing money properly.,,Housel applies these somewhat abstract concepts through the use of countless stories and examples, which makes the digestion of them so much more straightforward. In the end, we‚Äôre left with a core set of principles for managing our money moving forward. And, spoiler alert, so much of that managing boils down to effective financial psychology ‚Äî the very subject of the title of this book.,,I think most readers will enjoy it quite thoroughly, and, as such, I recommend it highly.,,-Brian Sachetta,Author of ‚ÄúGet Out of Your Head‚Äù,If you have read 21 lessons for the 21 century, Warren Buffet or even Dave Ramsey this book has nothing to offer. The title is magnificent. Except it is. It about the psychology of money at all. It is a book on economics, investing and social behavior but to call it the ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù of money is a huge presumption of the material you are abut to read.,spends most of the book saying no one really knows anything about money, then gives a few recommendations at the end, most of them common sense.  them finishes with another small story about the economy since the great depression, but with limited biased analysis.,you can skip it...,I got this book on audible and listened to the whole thing in one day. This book is a different approach to money. It really is extremely thought provoking. I particularly enjoyed Never enough chapter. This book is written in such away that you are getting stories to help understand the examples in the book.,I really enjoyed the content in this book and recommend reading.,Current, timeless and Insightful! I just happened to stumble across the author on Twitter and I‚Äôm very glad I did.  I now follow and read many of his articles but this book is a must read for all. I have already shared it with all my family and friends including my son studying financial engineering at Cornell.  This is the type of book you should earmark to read over again, anytime you need to make a large financial decision. Bravo!,I‚Äôve read dozens of personal finance books and this is second only to @The simple path to wealth‚Äù by JL Collins.,Highly recommended,If someone wants to understand the psychology of money this book is a very good start...,Everyone is different and everyone have different wants and needs.,Thanks for this well thought out book on money. Interesting to hear a different perspective than the constant save more, spend less and think about the ideas behind it.,Nothing new here and not worth the time spent listening. Very US based and does not give insights to other markets.,Not what I expected from the book with such a title. A lot of things are contradictory to each other. There are many times when author refers to something with no real explanation, but just out of his own opinion. Later on when you are completely confused he explains it in some detail. Again pointing to his own opinion. Also, the way book is read is a bit pessimistic.,Finished this book out of curiosity but kept the same opinion until the end of the book. There are no real answers in this book.,Fundamentally I liked this book but I found myself not agreeing with the core concept which is to live frugally forever (pretty much until old age). When does one actually get to enjoy the fruits of their labour? Life is too short...,Before you pick up the Intelligent Investor, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, or any other book from one of those 'best investment books for...' lists, read this book. Clear, concise, intelligent, and practical, I'm yet to find a better foundation for an investment book library.,Easy to engage with and some elements that can be applied to you own behaviours.  Yes it‚Äôs got a US reader bias but it‚Äôs simple enough to look past this.  The narrator was engaging and as it‚Äôs not too long you can get through it without getting lost in longer and more weighty academic works.  A good introduction to the topic.,,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the ideas it presented. Thought-provoking and many ideas that I believe we can all apply to our lives!,one of the best books in terms of financial education and almost phylisophically deep interns of mindset and insight in human relationship with money and debt,A great down-to-earth book that explores dispassionately why are economy is where it is today. Though very US centric, there are still many parallels with the UK economy in this book. The narration is also beautifully read.,simple, comprehensive and informative book. I will definitely listen to it again and again as it has a lot of wisdom nuggets.,Narration detracted from the book. Amateur reader. Awkward breathing and swallowing while narrating. Rather unpleasant to have to hear.,Worst book I've ever heard. 3 simple points dragged out for 5 hours. Save money, invest long term, expect the unexpected,Totally fascinating book that I am about to re-listen to (especially chapter 19). I am finally learning about money and investing after 34 years of ignoring my finances. This is the first finance book I‚Äôve found that goes deeper than the numbers, to think about human  behaviour and what money actually means. It‚Äôs well written, smart and full of actionable insights.,it just seems the author babbles on and on to full up pages. his points could have been made a lot more succinctly.  there is nothing ground breaking in this book. I'd recommend finding a summary of this book on youtube.,A succinct explanation of the financial and investing world that I can relate to. Thank you. I am going to make my kids listen to this hopefully to learn what I wish I knew in my youth.,Thank you for the the read.,I've always earnt relatively good money but also spent it as fast as it come in. This has helped rewire my thought process to value my income.,Cheers Dan,,An important reference book for anyone looking to grasp the concept of one behavior with money.,Having spent a lifetime myself studying my own behavior with money and that of the thousands I have worked with, this book is going to move the dial for many who are trying to make sense of the whole money and investing  journey for an individual or household, even coming from someone who lives in Australia, a lot of these thoughts and principles are relevant.,,I really like the information in the book about the psychology of money, and I would give a higher rating (4-5 stars). But every time I try to listen to the book now it's not playing for whatever reason. All other audio books run smoothly in my library. Please help in fixing this issue and I will edit my review. Thank you.,This book is informative, entertaining and very much in line with how people really think about money.,I‚Äôm 55 and I gained so much understanding of how I really think about money and why I‚Äôve made some poor money decisions.,A book everybody should read and I‚Äôll be giving many copies away.,Narration is also excellent.,Very highly recommended.,This book feels to me like a breath of fresh air as the author spent a fair amount of ink on the art of being happy in life, which is an often neglected topic in many ‚Äúmoney books‚Äù.,After listening to this book, i feel lighthearted, and i am feeling more confident to focus on my own need and lifestyle because if money cannot help me to feel enough in life, why should i pursuit this financial power to begin with?,I‚Äôd say this is a very spiritual self help book instead of a guide to riches. It helps me to feel valid and grounded as a person in a world where how much you make marks how much you achieve.,A very good listening experience over all."

The Trackers Series Box Set,"Action & Adventure,Technothrillers,Post-Apocalyptic,Apocalyptic Fiction",Literature & Fiction,"I was fortunate to acquire the four volume boxed set. It was a real treat to listen to the entire series front to back over two days. Perhaps it was because I had the entire series, but this has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable post-apocalyptic survival series I have listened to. The characters were well developed and likable. Their inner strength and patriotism is defined as honorable, brave, and selfless. The story revolved around several major characters and points of interest; the nuclear attacks, the pandemic virus, the town of Estes Park - Colorado, Police Chief Marcus Colton, Sam 'Raven' Spears, Air Force Major Nathan Sardetti, Secretary of Defense Charlize Montgomery, Charlize‚Äôs son Ty, and of course the loyal and fearless Akita ‚ÄòCreek‚Äô. There are also several villains and ne‚Äôer-do-wells that cause more problems than the EMP itself. The strength and perseverance of the characters was admirable, the passion and spirit injected into the story was heart-warming. I truly enjoyed this series and would definitely recommend the box set if you can get it.,If you like EMP apocalypse stories this is the series for you! The fact that the entire series is in one audiobook for such a great price just makes it that much better. Nicholas Sansbury Smith writes a story that‚Äôs not only engaging and entertaining, but also extremely informative. The man knows what he‚Äôs talking about. You want a nice long adventure all in one place? Look no further, this series has it all, you won‚Äôt be able to put it down once you start! Gotta say I love the characters, Raven and Creek are favorties of mine, I‚Äôd happily follow them on any adventure they took.,,Bronson Pinchot is a great narrator and really helps bring the characters alive!,If you like this kind of thing (post-apocalypse prepper), this is the kind of thing you'll like.,,The author does a good job of addressing the aftermath of an EMP attack on the United States. He does not descend into long, drawn out descriptions of prepper gear. Example, he'll refer to a ""bugout bag"" without going on for 2000 words describing every item in it.,,Nearly 34 hours for 1 credit, it's a good value.,I hate stories that include zombies in end of the world activities.  There are no zombies in this book series.  An electronic pulse used as a weapon against the U.S. starts off a war, decimating the U.S. Government.  There are many parts where you just have to suspend reality.  I mean, being in D.C. in a bunker that gets hit by a nuclear bomb and surviving with just burns and cuts?  But this is not meant to be realistic; it's meant to entertain.  As you read the whole series, there are lots of characters, and they go in great directions.  It's a great long car ride book series, or great summer ""read"".  Bronson Pinchot never disappoints!,This is my third post-apocalyptic series from Nicholas Sansbury Smith and unlike Hell Divers or the Extinction Cycle this one offers up a much more realistic, and therefore possible, scenario as a backdrop. Similar to One Second After this book shows us the impact of an EMP attack on a small community, which happens to be one of the author's favorite places to visit, Estes Park, Colorado. Trackers also broadens the canvas beyond the small community by detailing the impact the attack has on the US government back in DC by following one of the Senators with some ties back to the Estes Park area.,,To set this series apart from the competition Smith starts it off with a murder mystery and adds a good dose of American Indian folklore throughout to give it a unique flavor within a crowded genre. The macro story line comes from following the government while the micro focuses on Estes Park, but both are rooted in relationships and what the individuals involved are willing to do to protect those that they love. Unfortunately for all involved this new world is not for the meek and even good people will need to do bad things if they hope to survive and protect their families.,,My only gripe about this series is the short time frame it covers from EMP attack to series end which just isn't long enough. It wouldn't surprise me to see this series extended at some point but for now this box set wraps itself up nicely and provides some closure for the main characters. The series ends on a high note and I would say the same of the narrator Bronson Pinchot who definitely found his stride as the series went on.,,This series begins with an EMP attack by North Korea that impacts much of the continental United States and things go downhill from there. Potent suspense, meticulous research and superb writing combine to make the Trackers series some of the author‚Äôs best work. Bronson Pinchot did a great job with the narration.,I really liked how the story flowed.  There was plenty of balance between really positive outcomes and more realistic horrific outcomes.  The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like were some of the character voices were a little strange.  In all, I enjoyed the overall story from the author of the series connected well.  Well worth the audible credit.,This series gives us a lot to think about our integrity and survival mind sets.,I really enjoyed the unique take on the EMP genre and four books for the price of one is a great deal. If you enjoy Smith's other books you will more than likely really enjoy these. He tells a story that can really happen, in a way how it would happen.,This was an excellent series. It was a major plus coming as a boxed series. The narration was a bit lacking but not enough to distract from the great story. It was frightening on a whole different level.,This isn‚Äôt the kind of book I would normally listen to if I‚Äôm honest, but I have a long job to do in complete, working on my own, and I needed something long to listen to. Also I would never normally write a review such as this but aspects of this story struck me so much I feel compelled to do this...,So, my interest was definitely sustained by the writing and the excellent narration. The writing drew me in and it wasn‚Äôt long before welfare of the characters in the story began to matter to me. Having said all of that it‚Äôs not a very demanding plot...but may be it doesn‚Äôt need to be.,The threats outlined in the story are very real I‚Äôm sure and it‚Äôs not difficult to imagine the outcomes of this type of aggressive act on any first world country.,What struck me throughout the story though, and what compelled me to write this, is the constant reference to the loss of American lives, with the emphasis it seems to me, on the American. I live in the UK, have grown up in the UK, but have travelled to numerous counties around the world and experienced numerous cultures. What comes across in these books is an attitude that American lives are in some way more valuable than other lives. Is this really how citizens of the U.S. see the world? If it is then I salute the author in his accurate representation of this. It is, however, a concept quite alien to me. We all live on the same planet under the same sky and one human life to me is just as valuable as any other, regardless of nationality or any other demographic. So how accurately the author has represented the attitudes and mindset of the people of the U.S. I just can‚Äôt say, but he has put forward an accurate representation here then I find that quite scary.,This is a great book series  from a favourite author of mine , Hell Divers being the books that introduced me to Nicholas‚Äôs  work . The Trackers series follows the struggle of a small town community after an EmP attack on the USA . From the intro introducing the scenario and Nicks background in disaster preparation you know it‚Äôs going to be a serious look into the effects of an emp Attack . But it‚Äôs not a documentary , there are some fantastic characters you come to know, love and hate  with some Brilliant Native American culture woven into this post apocalyptic thriller via one of the main characters  . It‚Äôs a hard book to put into one category, there‚Äôs is great military action with gunfights and how the US government tries to cope with the situations and fallout from the chaos .  Excellent character and world  building (you really feel like you know the town and it‚Äôs people ) interesting and often worrying  factual stuff about the emp and it‚Äôs horrific effects on wentern civilisation, great reluctant heros and heroines and perfectly evil bad guys . There is Lots more I‚Äôd love to say about the books but i would not want to give any spoilers.  The narrator is perfect for the roles and makes every character unique , his voice and way of story telling really pulls you in . it‚Äôs 5 stars all around for the series .,Great work Nick Smith !,The narration is horrendous - supposedly hardened marines sounding like panic stricken children, delivery not matching the specific description of tone and volume in the text, cartoonish accents.,The basic premise of the story is great - a plausible attack using current tech, but then it‚Äôs spoiled by all the tired old cliches of seaparated children, troubled veterans trying to redeem themselves, herds of clueless campers just waiting to be preyed upon by the instantly coalesced paramilitary gangs.,All that could be forgiven if the text didn‚Äôt try so damn hard with pointless detail. The model designation of a helicopter, the specs of a piece of equipment - all sorts of minutiae just sprinkled into the narrative for no purpose. It all comes across as if the author is looking up amthings on wikipedia to sound like he knows what he‚Äôs talking about, rather than using information he ubderstands to drive the plot.,Turned it off after an hour. Awful narration. Returning this book. The narrator clearly hasn't heard of conpressing his voice in post. Goes from whispering to shouting in two sentences... Almost gave me a heart attack.,found it,difficult to put down.!,narrator so good. a very thought provoking storyline. certainly want to hear of Raven.,I did enjoy this but found myself frustrated a lot through it. some of the characters were just not done well. Raven was great Sherif Colton was awful. Too much guns and shooting and not enough character development for me . Could have been amazing. I loved the fact that they didn't make the Chinese the bad people. Interesting. I had just listened to the box set of slow burn before this and I have to say despite not being into zombies and it being ridiculously far-fetched I loved it because the characters were done so brilliantly.,too many flaws in and inconsistencies in the subplots of some of  the characters. fails to make you absorb the story in too many places. just does not deliver for me.based on a good idea though.,I loved this series and help but think that it would make an outstanding TV series.,Loved the whole book series from start to end.,Couldnt it put it down!,Excellent story telling and performance.,If you love post apocalyptic fictions youre tonna love this series.,,A bit slow and predictable. I found it to be the usual American improbable no guts no glory with the hero taking on a whole army of storm troopers. That said worth a listen and the writer had some good comments.,the story was good and I think with the right narrator it would be great but the narrator is very boring and would be better off reading nursery rhymes to put kids to sleep,No surprises or originality here. You have read it all before. Cliche after cliche after cliche.,I bought this series on an impulse, and am glad that I did. The story gripped me from start to finish, and never got stale or old. The characters are believable, likeable, and come across as natural and not forced.,,I highly recommend picking this audiobook up. It's brilliant and well worth the listen.,Great story and subplots. Characters with depth. Awesome narration. All 3 books are worth a listen.,Definitely a great read. Engaging characters in a town coping with the aftermath of an EMP and now besieged by militant gangs. A govt in tatters trying to rebuild amongst violence, famine and disease. Quite gruesome in parts but that only adds to the realism of a social breakdown where the strong poet on the weak.,These four books are very very good, well worth the money if someone has wanting a Thriller/ Drama type of Books. Thanks Nicholas for writing such great novels.,Writing and narrating was fantastic. The voice work for differing characters was well done. You can tell the writer has a passion for what they do and the subject they write about.,If I travel to America on holidays again, I might just visit Estes park.,Had me hooked start to finish, narration was incredible. Would like to here some short stories of raven chasing some nazi‚Äôs and North Korean terrorist‚Äôs.,a good book would be good if one or two Moore of the nice guys stayed alive through and the deputy motive for selling his town out was not explaned,Story was great, but the narrative is hard work, it‚Äôs a shame as I‚Äôve enjoyed this writer but RC Bray was reading. It shows how important the narration is to the story."

Butterfly 5,"African American,Contemporary",Literature & Fiction,"I heard it all before....this book was a waste, nothing got resolved..no growth no maturity..just temper tantrums and half truths I'm over this series, she's dragging it out and it's loosing the fire..  Sincerely BRUNT OUT,Where do I start! First off I love me some Ethic, but this storyline was too much about him and Alani. I want to literally hurt Morgan. This is my least favorite Butterfly series‚Ä¶Im really hate I spent my money and time listening to this book!!! It took me 3 days to finish it because it was so uninteresting‚Ä¶If it wasn't for Nicole Smalls I would have never finish it!!! Ashley you really need to give the fans what they deserve and this book isn't it!!! How much hurt does Ethic n Alani have to encounter? At this point I prefer you to bring Raven from the dead and leave Morgan, Messiah, Meek, Ari, Essa and blue on the shelf!!!,I hate Morgan! She is such a brat it makes no sense for someone to feel so entitled! I want Messiah to find love with the dr, Meek to let Mo go, and Blue to carry her a$$ to Cali w her child and other man.,I‚Äôm only on chapter 5 and I‚Äôm AG‚Ä¢GRA‚Ä¢VATED üò© bruh it‚Äôs the same ol story over and over again sheeshhhhh!!!! Imma finish it tho lol but come on we need some type of resolution‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm only into chapter 16 and already frustrated and annoyed! This is the same merry go round. Can‚Äôt any happiness ever come. It‚Äôs constant confusion deceiving and uncertainty. It‚Äôs like black folks only know drama,Omg, I read the book 1st.,Then purchased it on audible (just to hear it read by Mrs.Small; she makes it more of a reality).,I had the same reaction to reading and listening; shocked, crying, laughing, lusting then crying again but holding my chest.,Ashley, your talent is far more amazing then any other adjectives I can‚Äôt think of. You‚Äôre definitely a force to be reckoned with.,P.S. Please allow Ethic to love Alani‚Äôs memory back and they raise their family properly( we haven‚Äôt seen black love that last since the Huxtables), next, let the Messiah date his therapist, and Blue get back with what‚Äôs his name. Release, Henny for me and Bella, allow Aria and Issa to marry and settled down with kids and long money, let Hawk get got, but make sure you clear Ahmeeks name and let him love Morgan like Ethic love Alani.,If you had to remove someone remove Livi, she‚Äôs annoying to say she makes her own money and does well for herself let her move on from Ahmeek; maybe introduce her to Moe.,Great read hands down!! Now I‚Äôm going listen to it again. Chapter 18, I think is my favorite because of the love Ahmeek showed for Morgan he didn‚Äôt even have to say it I felt it.,#IloveAhmeek #teamAhmeekandMorgan,As always I brought the actual book when it first came out and I read it within a few hours! Couldn‚Äôt put it down. Then I waited for the audio version because I love Nicole Small! But as I‚Äôm listening I‚Äôm noticing that a lot of things were left out‚Ä¶ but the biggest notice was the ending. It was missing like two whole chapter! What happened? Everything left out was important‚Ä¶ at least in my mind. So I feel cheated because it‚Äôs not adding up to the what‚Äôs on paper. But I guess those who have only listened to the audio book wouldn‚Äôt know what they are missing‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,***Spoiler alert***I'm discussing specifics. I seem to remember after B3 that B4 was going to be the end. I was upset on how long we had to wait for Butterfly 4 and was disappointed with that book because it wasn't the end. Then to wait another LONG time for B5 and am even more disappointed in the character non-development. We haven't progressed any further than the last book, Messiah still hasn't told Morgan who the woman/child is; Messiah is totally oblivious to the fact that ""he"" told Ameek to take care of Morgan...what the hell did he expect to happen after X damn years? the timing being mentioned is whack...Morgan was newly pregnant when Messiah left and had the babies maybe 7-8 months later, and the twins are almost 3. That's close to 4 years...yet they keep mentioning 2 years. There was no explanation about how Meek ""captured"" the royals and what happened to the dad; too much time was spent on Ethic/Alani and the TOTAL amnesia is just not realistic; the only bright spot in this book was the therapist. I will read B6 and I'm sure it's going to be at least another year but at this point, I'm way too invested in Ethicland, but I feel as if these books are so popular and I'm sure that financially it's advantageous to drag the story out as much as possible. It's just frustrating for me as a reader because Ashley is a great writer and I love her stories. I fully expect that we will experience the same long-drawn out affair if/when there is a Bella arc.,I‚Äôve been riding with Ashley for over nine years‚Ä¶ And I was so enthralled with the butterfly collection‚Ä¶ However, I‚Äôm starting to get bored with the storyline‚Ä¶ One thing I like about it is that she brought Mo from the Cartel book into the narrative‚Ä¶ The second thing I like is she exed out a lot of the characters who were serving no purpose‚Ä¶ However, her storyline just goes around in a circle‚Ä¶ I am tired of the back-and-forth with Mo n Messiah‚Ä¶ Morgan getting on my nerves with her indecisiveness‚Ä¶ But mostly, I don‚Äôt like how she brings in all of that extra narrative that‚Äôs not needed‚Ä¶ Give us the storyline‚Ä¶ But also give us more dialogue‚Ä¶ It seems she gives so many descriptions on the feelings that each character has‚Ä¶ In my opinion that takes away from the story‚Ä¶ nevertheless, it is always a treat to hear my favorite narrator‚Ä¶ Nicole Small‚Ä¶ I love her so much!!!,I would tell everyone who knows about the Butterfly collection read the book to see how you feel‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a bad book‚Ä¶ But I believe the storyline is being dragged out‚Ä¶ I am a little disappointed in the book‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been waiting all this time for it and Yet we are left with another cliff hanger‚Ä¶ But read it to,gather your own opinion,Too much dragging and nothing was answered from previous story. Very disappointing. Still don‚Äôt know who Morgan will end up with! I had very high expectations. I think this is probably my last book from this series. After a year of waiting, I expected so much more!!!,Sigh, I‚Äôm committed to this story and I‚Äôm so annoyed about that! There‚Äôs literally zero joy in this booküò≠ one step forward, only for five steps back ü•π,Storyline literally had me in a chokehold. Absolutely brilliant. I‚Äôm literally finished this in less then 24hr.  I was so hooked I couldn‚Äôt function and go about my daily life.  I can‚Äôt wait for b5,Ok, I‚Äôm ready for Butterfly 6. Please, you can‚Äôt end it like that. Ashley done it again, knocked it right out of the park."
All the Hidden Paths,"Fantasy,Action & Adventure",LGBTQ+,"I'm addicted to this entire universe. the political atmosphere, the people/characters, the horses. all of it is living in my head rent free but none more than our mcs. ugh I love them,Ugh so good.,I didn‚Äôt know I would be so interested in a gay side pairing to the gay MCs but WOW, obsessed with Spicy General and Az. It‚Äôs giving Captive Prince Pet vibes.,I could read a million more of these books.,I really enjoy these books, the plot always hits and I‚Äôm never bored and I adore that the author never feels the need to tell me Vel is smart, it is SHOWN through his thought process and actions (cough cough looking at u unnamed TikTok famous dragon riding book main characterüëÄ),There is‚Ä¶ a continued theme of everyone‚Äôs outfits being described in intense detail, which on very few occasions has held plot/character significance. Same with the food‚Ä¶which they eat a lot‚Ä¶ (im currently calorie counting which is evil and the food descriptions in these books are also evil) it doesn‚Äôt seem to have much purpose other than like‚Ä¶ an insane amount of specific world building.,Or for the meal to be interrupted like people be KNOCKING on doors during meals next listen through I‚Äôm gonna tally (and there def will be a relisten at some point I‚Äôm sure),Or one very specific plot point in this book (which is a good one !!),A million plus points for james fouhey who always sounds amazing and minus one point for vikas adams, he puts his all into it, im just not the biggest fan of his performances BUT the tithenai chronicles are amazing enough that i still re listened to book one in prep for book two üôå,I extremely liked the plot to this story and how it always kept me on the edge of my seat with excitement as I tried to put all the Ôøºpieces together like Val and K. I also enjoyed following how the two main character built a stronger connection and tried to find out who was trying to kill them at the same time made for an amazing story the narration was fantastic and was done amazingly and I‚Äôm shore it going to be one of those stories that will be read again and again.üòä"
10x Is Easier than 2x,"Motivation & Self-Improvement,Personal Success",Business & Careers,"Ok by my initial title, it may seem like it is too good to be true, but honestly there was so many lightbulb moments that my brain couldn‚Äôt keep it. Though this book is tailored towards entrepreneurs, it possess the invitation to imagine what‚Äôs possible. Then strip away what‚Äôs not necessary to the core essentials.,This is true in anything you want to create or bring forth into the world. I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough, it is definitely going to be a book that I‚Äôll keep coming back too again and again.,The concept put forth is quite interesting in and of itself. It is, however, difficult to take the author seriously when it appears he does not practice what he preaches. Applying the 10x theory would have meant utilizing the best available editor to catch poor grammar, and hiring a professional narrator with the ability to pronounce the word linear correctly. Overall, the book is very difficult to listen to due to the narration, and also due to the regurgitative style of writing. The book could likely have been 1/10 the length had the same things been repeated dozens of times in slightly different ways.,I recently had the pleasure of reading ""10x is Easier than 2x,"" and I must say it's a great book that presents compelling principles. The author of the book has done an excellent job of sharing insights that resonate with readers.,From the start, it becomes clear that the book is grounded in practicality. The principles presented are not only well-researched but also make perfect sense in the context of achieving higher levels of productivity. The author's writing style is engaging, making it easy to grasp the concepts and apply them to real-life situations.,One aspect that stands out in this book is its focus on leveraging productivity. ""10x is Easier than 2x"" presents a refreshing perspective that encourages readers to think beyond incremental growth and instead strive for exponential improvement. The author masterfully breaks down the barriers that limit our potential, providing actionable steps and strategies to help readers enhance their productivity in all aspects of life.,I particularly appreciate how the book emphasizes the importance of mindset. The author explores the power of positive thinking, resilience, and personal motivation, instilling a sense of empowerment in readers. The practical tips and examples provided throughout the book further solidify the principles and ensure their applicability.,""10x is Easier than 2x"" not only offers valuable insights but also inspires readers to take action. It's a motivational guide that encourages individuals to push beyond their comfort zones and embrace a growth mindset. By following the principles outlined in the book, readers can make significant strides in their personal and professional lives.,In conclusion, I highly recommend ""10x is Easier than 2x"" to anyone seeking practical advice on increasing productivity. The author has crafted a book that presents sensible principles in an accessible manner. Prepare to be inspired, motivated, and equipped with the tools needed to unlock your full potential.,I started to listen to this and got through 2 chapters before it became too painful.,The mutual admiration society between the two authors is nice‚Ä¶just goes on way too much.,The content is PAINFULLY repetitive. Exceptionally repetitive. Repetitive repetitive.,The author has a high pitched voice that made it hard to listen to.,I got the hard copy so I could skim and it‚Äôs much easier to work with so I can speed through the repeated bits.,This is actually a much smaller book once the unnecessary items are removed or trimmed. Great concept, just laborious to get through.,Best ‚Äúhow too‚Äù business book since Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Beyond today‚Äôs platitudes and feel good millennial bs.,There is, definitely, some genuinely helpful thoughts in here, well presented. I say that first because I don't want to give the wrong idea with what I'm about to say next. There are also a few sections where it's misusing physics ideas in ways that if you know about actual physics will make you want to give up immediately and listening before you get to the rest. This happens in multiple places, spread out. That stuff is common in some business community talks, so apparently it helps some people visualize or remember something, but typically it's kept in its own separate places or material away from the more grounded audience. Anyway, I encourage toughing through or skipping those bits to get back to the rest of it, because there's more after it which is better again.,This work is an excellent example of moving the Theory of Constraints and the 80/20 Pareto principle to a higher level. Sullivan‚Äôs ideas have always fascinated me and Dr Dan Hardy has done a great job around clarity and illustration.   This book is definitely in the top ten in my personal library of over 2,000. Highly recommended.,,Same content repackaged with new examples a few new insights. Ten X Ten X ten x,The book makes several useful points. The entire book could have been a 10 page essay.   The book was wordy and repetitive. And how does a guy with a PhD not know how to pronounce linear?!,I wish they could give the punch and the wisdom at the beginning of the chapter and then for those who need the tiresome stories they could listen.,So it was extremely hard for me to get out the good points. there are of course good points but you need to dig them. the price is waisting your time and skipping parts. I wonder how those who aim for perfection cannot see simple points like that.,the interviews are great since Dan gives his experience but you wont find them on the audio,I honestly feel really bad for leaving such a poor review. I also don't understand why this has such high reviews. This book left me feeling as though I'd been mugged. In the way you feel when you've paid your tax and then HMRC come back and say you still owe us money even though you have been very diligent and it's our mistake but you still have to face the consequences of our mistaken.,this book is 80/20 rule repackaged plus examples of entrepreneurs having penny drops ""well if I stopped focusing on the day to day, leave that to the people I've employed and then start focusing on the business then we will grow"",I think I'm more angry with myself that I fell for it. what a waste of a credit.,Inspiring, challenging, useful ideas at every stage and I was implementing these immediately.,A little presumptuous calling Michelangelo ‚Äò10X‚Äô though you‚Äôll get the point.,A nice touch having the open dialogue with the author at the end of each chapter, recapping on the ideas.,So much value. I will listen to this another 10 times to embed the thinking. Rewire my brain from the 2x approach,Dr Ben Hardy and Sir Dan Sullivan, thank you so much for crafting and bringing this beautiful present to me and the rest of the world. I have a calling on my life but recently I have felt stuck, well‚Ä¶.this book unstuck me and I‚Äôm now aiming for the stars. I feel fresh and awaken. Thank you again and God bless you!!,This book was helpful. It has a motivating energy and some practical advice. The interview sections at the end of each chapter added some meat to the concept but perhaps could have been tidied up with post production and scripts in places. One thing that was distracting was the narrator‚Äôs pronunciation of ‚Äúlinear‚Äù. I have never heard it said as ‚Äúlin-eeear‚Äù I told myself to let it go and focus on the content but I couldn‚Äôt because the word was used frequently in the book.,I also noticed several references to religion which I think the author tried to hold back on until the end, then let rip. Perhaps was intended to show how the 10X can work in any area of life and also show an area that‚Äôs important to Ben.,Good book overall. I found value in listening to it.,I‚Äôd recommend this book to anyone who is looking to scale their business and life.,I know this guy is a big name, and the premise of the book is good. But one of his 'short books' would have done nicely. 10x is better than 2x. Done. The rest is filled with rambling interview waffle full of ums and ahs, no practical suggestions really, and then at the end it veers off into a case study in christian missionary work which was very concerning. Also, the author really needs to learn how to pronounce linear. If you're seeking inspiration, and a missionary Christian, this might be a good book for you. Otherwise, there are better.,This book changed my life. I wrote over 20 different cards of comments around it. Right now I already gave this to my co-founder also to read it. I am so excited and I can't wait to read the next book. Who, not how. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You changed my life.,For anyone who is looking to create quantum leaps in their lives and business then this feels like a must read, navigation guide.,It is hard hitting in that it will challenge your status quo thinking and at that same time provide practical means for moving forward.,I personally loved the interview sections at the end of each chapter with Dan as it brought everything to life for me.,Make no mistake though, listening to this is the easy bit. Putting it into practice will be the challenge.,i thoroughly enjoyed the book in many ways  it is loaded with practical advice, great ideas and new concepts. I enjoyed personal stories a lot.,The conclusion blew my mind with the scale on spiritual development. The same can be said for Michelangelo and Jim Carrey's story. Thank you Dan and Hardy.,A great book that you can read and implement the learnings right away! Full of value and something to revisit multiple times as it helps you grow.,Really enjoyed elements of this book, some of the concepts landed so clearly for me. Thinking about coming from your gains rather than your gap, so useful to think about as business has a tendency to always look forwards and never back.,Also the need to focus your energy of your 20% unique ability and get ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs‚Äô to cover the rest - it‚Äôs clever though feels overly privileged and not accessible for many.,Good read and I found aspects really valuable.,The concept of this book will improve your family life and business immensely.,Fantastic job guys I‚Äôll be reading every book you have available as I‚Äôm hungry for improvements  Setting the foundation for my children to take note.,Thank again,The content is great. The stories and examples bring it to life (although it could easily be shorter),But the only reasoni can't give this five stars is that Ben shouts at you, he doesn't read or perform.,It's such a shame. But I had to stop listening. I hope this changes in futures books as I'm a massive fan of Dan's work.,,listen to Dan directly vs this guy who just rehashes everyone else over and over - we get it 10x is easier,Grippingly transformative. Every paragraph has deep meaning. The tools to create almost instant, positive change. Just Brilliant.,This book was a real journey for me.  Through my inner world of who I think I am and who I assume I‚Äôm not regarding potentials.   I‚Äôm sure grateful to the author for his intention and attention writing this.  I‚Äôm inspired and I feel way more capable of bigger things after this read. üôè,Gives a perspective that sometimes letting go of things is enormously good in the longer run. I especially liked how authors linked the stories and concepts from different books to give a combined clarification of concepts.,I listen to a lot of business books and this one is one of the few I rate very highly. Very consumable actionable guidance for levelling up your business. Useful for entrepreneurial leaders not just entrepreneurs.,This is such a life expanding insight into what‚Äôs truly possible and how to live into a complete change of business and life. Thank you, thank you, thank you!,The insights and analogy about Michelangelo and the statue of David was so impactful."

The Graham Effect,"Contemporary,Sports",Romance,"Audiobook Review:,The Graham Effect,By: Elle Kennedy,Narrated By: Teddy Hamilton and CJ Bloom,Okay, this was so fun to listen to! This type of character for Teddy Hamilton to narrate is by far my favorite! A broody, sexy, mature, confident hockey player YES please!! Both Teddy and CJ Bloom did an outstanding job as Luke Ryder and GiGi Graham.,It was so fun to be back at Briar University and hearing about Garret and Hannah being parents. What a fun way to continue on with your favorite characters from Elle Kennedy‚Äôs past books. I really enjoyed the relationship Garret had with his daughter GiGi (who this book followed), GiGi‚Äôs relationship with her twin brother and their family dynamics was super sweet.,I absolutely loved GiGi Graham. I loved her independence, her confidence and her drive to work hard at being a great hockey player.,I have a new found love for sports romance novels where women in sport are at the forefront of the story.,Luke Ryder was one of a kind, starting out as a broody, cocky hockey star turned into a boy in love and I was here for every minute of it.,Luke had a rough childhood and hearing what he went through as a kid is difficult but the way he overcame so much was incredible. He had a great relationship with his brother even after all they had been through and I loved that they stuck together and Luke had Owen to be there for him.,The banter in this book was laugh out loud funny. The moments of Luke visiting The Graham‚Äôs house during the holidays was by far my favorite moments of this book, I was grinning from his sarcasm and nervousness of that entire trip.,Overall, this was such a fun audiobook to listen to. Luke and Gigi were such a wonderful couple, their communication & honesty was refreshing and I enjoyed the love & respect they truly had for each other.,,Welcome back to Briar U! We get to revisit some of the all time favorite characters (Garrett, Hannah, Dean, Logan) and meet the next generation. Garrett and Hannah's daughter Gigi is first up. She's a tenacious hockey player and a dynamic character. The H, Luke Ryder, has many layers and is also a complex person. As usual, Kennedy brings out many emotions with drama and comedy. Their relationship is refreshing. Some fun new characters. I look forward to more from this generation. Narrators were perfection,Love Elle Kennedy and loved this story! Some audio recording errors and a storyline continuity issue at one point, but other than that I was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend.,I was really excited for this book.  Unfortunately it could of been a lot better.  Needed more character development with Ryders family background.  Especially relationship with his half brother.   Author tried to cram way to much in the last hour that cheapened the whole story.  Not sure where all these great reviews are coming from.  This is ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è at best.  Major disappointment.  If it wasn‚Äôt for the excellent narration this would of been  ‚≠êÔ∏è.,This was almost a dnf for me. Way too long and just plain awful. Very much would not recommend.,I absolutely loved The Graham Effect.  It‚Äôs been a while since I fell in love with the  original Briar U books so I was nervous about the next generation but Elle knocked it out the park (or the hockey equivalent).  It was the perfect mix of original & next gen.  I couldn‚Äôt put it down!! I love love loved Teddy & CJ as GiGi & Ryder.,,Both the ebook and the audio version are fantastic. I highly recommend it and can‚Äôt wait for the next book. A solid 5-star read!,,,Sweet story and easy to get invested in their journey - wasn‚Äôt ready for it to be over wanted more - can‚Äôt wait for the next book,I loved everything about Ryder and Graham‚Äôs relationship. I‚Äôm never a big fan of too much drama between the MC‚Äôs and their relationship. I loved that there wasn‚Äôt a dramatic break up but they faced their own share of problems. 10/10 I‚Äôd recommend.,I am surprised to say that I may have liked this book better than The Deal. The original will always be a great book but this one surprised me on how good it was and how well the storyline followed and kept me entertained.,I loved it. The fact that some of the original characters made it in the book and we got to see a bit into their lives after marriage and kids. Hopefully we get to see more of them on the next books."
Induction,"Adventure,First Contact,Post-Apocalyptic",Science Fiction & Fantasy,"Of course Travis killed it as usual no surprise to anyone there. It may be because he is the narrator but this book reminded me of the unbound series. I felt like this was a good new entry to Litrpg.,MC has some issues and you will question some of his decision making. At the same time I also think for the most part he is a good MC. Character development is in the works.,World and system building were done well with some details left a little fuzzy for me. The overall story does interest me and the timing of the MCs start leaves so much future for this series.,I only have one regret listening to this book. that is that I listened to it right away and now I have to wait. as always Oswald comes out swinging and instantly sucks you in for the whole series. the narration is great also. not many people can pull off solo narration but baldtree pulls it off.,Really enjoyed this one a lot. This sort of new look at system apoc is super fun, the countdown to actual dooms day and only a few people having a idea and not being able to tell anyone on earth is just crazy interesting. Looking forward to where this goes and how it gets fleshed out.,It‚Äôs captivating from the beginning and i like how well put together the story is. And the stat chapters were an awesome idea!,This is a great start to a new series. Intriguing characters and places. I‚Äôm looking forward to listening to more.,I don't know the main character just kind of annoys me when he you know decides hey I figure out the end of the world is coming and I need to practically save the planet what do I going to do I'm going to spend my free time joining a f****** sport that will mean absolutely nothing soon makes sense you know joint join some fighting Club do something like that no no I'm going to join some sports team that absolutely gives me no Advantage whatsoever,It's not the best thing I've ever read, but I don't have anything to complain about ...that is actually waaaaaay more impressive than anything else I could say.  Unfortunately a lot of my reviews, even generally positive ones feature one or 2 major complaints.  This book though, start to finish nothing broke my immersion.  I was truly caught up in the story, just enjoying listening to one of my favorite narrators do his thing.,,Again, I don't think the author reinvented the wheel or anything.  There is some novelty in how the MC gets sucked into the system and magic, but at it's core the subject matter is pretty familiar.  The difference lays in the execution.  This was a really polished piece of writing.,,Sean Oswald is a talented dude.  I've actually already been following this guy without realizing it.  I've enjoyed a couple of his other books as well, but I hadn't paid attention to who the author was.  With this book tho ...now he's one of those authors that I will follow in earnest.  Consider me a fan.,,Worth the credit!!!,I actually just stopped listening when it was 30 mins left, found myself not caring what happened at all.,The mc is bad, the story is bland the system is weak and feels completely random or too big. I don't remember the mc's name. All bad men hate women, but also wanna murder people.,The mc inner dialog makes him out to be much better than everyone, understanding towards people. And how he has to be careful with his new powers. Except when people have slightly shitty personalities then it's fine to abuse is powers to hurt them a little.,Travis baldree is awesome as always.,It‚Äôs the gamer trope with the ‚Äòwell this isn‚Äôt a video game and proceeds to act like it‚Äôs a video game. It‚Äôs not a bad book by any measure if you can get past that part. It actually has a really good storyline and the narrator is like always‚Ä¶ perfect. I really enjoyed how I didn‚Äôt have to listen to so many stats and the action is good if drawn out. The world building is where it really has potential.,this book is a great start to a new series. I like the speed of developing storie and the main character.,Don‚Äôt get the book if you don‚Äôt want to listen to a story about a healer. as for the other characters, it‚Äôs very basic it‚Äôs pretty cool sometimes but that‚Äôs mainly because the narrator makes it sound cooler than actually is. The cover or needs to be updated because it‚Äôs very misleading. I was expecting a spear wielding lone wolf sort of character but in reality it‚Äôs a rogue that can‚Äôt be hit because people think he‚Äôs too cute.,Oh, and he heals for some reason .,Easy to follow and understand, engaging story. Will be happy to continue listening to this series, and as always, an excellent performance by Travis.,Over the years I‚Äôve read so many system induction LitRPG books and I started to get a bit jaded, but I‚Äôm glad I read this book. This story follows a popular trope and doesn‚Äôt have many new concepts but the way it‚Äôs written kept it interesting. The MC is realistic and his decision making is actually believable. The side characters are a bit 2-dimensional, but it doesn‚Äôt take away from the story. The world building has a unique spin on how new worlds are inducted into the system. Oh and of course, Travis Baldree does an exceptional job of getting you fully immersed in the action. I can‚Äôt wait for the next instalment. Just wish I could read ahead on RoyalRoad or something‚Ä¶,The characters are relateable, the story is well written, and the dialogue is smooth. Pop-culture references galore and nods at other LiT RPG stories, but it's all presented in a way that leaves out the cringe. Excellent!,This is a great twist on the idea of earth being enrolled into the multiverse, with a few ‚Äúforerunners‚Äù leading the way before the rest of the world, fighting for their place.,It has good pacing, lots of action, a relatable MC, and those sweet sweet stats we all love, but put in their own chapters so they can be skipped if you want.,Add to that Sean dropping both pop culture references and enough references to other LITRPG books to make it meta without being cringe, and you have a great start to what I hope will be an epic series.,Lastly, it‚Äôs read by the one and only Travis Baldree, so what‚Äôs not to love?,great unfolding story with lots of room for growth, main character has a steady progression and no overpowered stats or skills.,Great opener for a series,Solid world building and RPG,Interesting MC,Looking forward to hearing the next one.,wonderful narration too."

The Body Keeps the Score,"Alternative & Complementary Medicine,Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders,Psychology,Body Language,Childhood Trauma,Trauma Informed,Mental Health Coaching,Healing Emotional Trauma",Health & Wellness,"I found this book to be extremely well documented and quite frankly, without the exceptional narration I don‚Äôt feel I would have gained as much from the authors knowledge in trauma. If you‚Äôre a fan of Sam Harris you‚Äôll love this narration. As to the content, as someone who is a survivor of childhood trauma, I felt the book lingered too long in the multiple case histories and ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of the traumas and missed an opportunity to provide actionable solution, tools and resources for the reader. If you‚Äôre a trauma survivor the last thing you want or need is 20 hours of dark and triggering accounts, you‚Äôre living your own trauma already. What would have been invaluable to me would have been a sense of hope and possibility for healing and again, tools and resources to help those of us highly functional but quietly suffering, a chance to take what this obviously brilliant clinician has to share and incorporate it into our own lives. Still well worth the investment.,This book was very interesting however I had a hard time listening to more than 15 mins at a time due to explanation of others traumatic experiences. Kind of retraumatizing if you are still in a healing state,This book was a recommendation to me from a health professional. Although it was dense with research for the first 11 chapters, it was a good foundation to build on for future chapters. The narrator did a good job keeping pace and tone consistent to keep interest. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through the book without audible. Start at Chapters 12/13 for those who want specific, evidence based interventions.,Wow. Never has an intro to a review been more appropriate. This book opened my mind and delivered an understanding of myself and everyone around me in a manner I had not considered before.  Bottom line for me:  everything matters. The body doesn‚Äôt forget anything, no matter what our brain tries to do to help us cope with life. Truly worthwhile listen for me. My gratitude to the author and his years of researching that brought this work to light.,I am close to finishing this book and I have already recommended it to everyone I know. There are no negative words which I could use to describe this book. From the writing, to the consistency, organization, level of comprehension, detailed examples/stories, knowledge and much more, this book is the most put together piece of writing that I have ever had the pleasure of reading/listening to in my life. Not only that, but the information given about Trauma has been life changing for me. This is a book I'm going to be coming back to many times.,my book club and i decided to read this book.  we all work in the homeless shelter and felt this would help us with working with some of our clients/guests.  My son kidnapped my book and i decided that i would check out the audio version of the book.  i love it!  i am facinated by the key points that stuck out while lustening compared to reading it!  I am playing with the idea of this being something i can adopt and apply with other books in the future; Reading the book and then going over it again with audio version.   anyways besides that, the book is great subject matter is really thought provoking.,I heard so many great things about this book and I really wanted to like it.. to me it just seems that this book is trauma p*rn. The author goes into great detail about the traumas of vets and never gives tips on how to heal it.,If this book also focused on healing the trauma and not just re-living it then it might be something worth while.,My plan is to listen several more times.  So much to absorb. All great information. üëçThis book is a definite keeper. Author is caring, concise, with appropriate stories to accompany technical terms. I felt as if he was speaking directly to me. Will definitely pass it onto others. Thank you Author from thw bottom of my heart.,This book has helped me tremendously. I was recently diagnosed with complex ptsd. After being misdiagnosed as bipolar for my entire adult life. It has been life changing.,This book helped me understand why therapies beyond CBT and meds are often more appropriate for people struggling to find their way with the effects of developmental trauma.,In this book, the author generously offers his years of experience and shines a light on issues which threaten the mental health of so many people every day.,It‚Äôs a sad fact though, that in the current economic squeeze many of the solutions offered here-which would ultimately make all our lives so much richer-are the first in line to be cut as more money is diverted to the mutually self-serving industries of defence and big pharma, both of which are responsible for much of the trauma discussed here."
The Boys of Winter,"Sports,United States,Hockey,Olympics & Paralympics,Hockey Biographies",Biographies & Memoirs,"This book provides phenomenal additional depth to the story of the 1980 gold medal winning USA hockey team. You will not be disappointed.,The one bad part (and this might just be nitpicking) is the narrator mispronounces just about every hockey term, and Russian name throughout the entirety of the book.,Obviously this story needs little help. The author does a great job diving deep into the people involved and fleshing out many details. The narrator is brutal. He has a sort of sissy lisp. He obviously doesn‚Äôt know hockey as many of the terms are savages. IE blue line is one words, not two. It‚Äôs obnoxious after hearing it over and over. Plus his efforts to jazz up the Soviet names is pointless and distracting.,When your first reaction to an incredible story is the narrator then you‚Äôve got a problem.  Having a narrator that is unfamiliar with the subject and mispronounces ‚Äúdeked‚Äù and ‚ÄúGuy LaFluer‚Äù creates a credibility issue for the author.,,I don‚Äôt know what is worse; having someone narrate a book about hockey and get names wrong and not know how to pronounce them or say Blue Line‚Ä¶ ( like it‚Äôs two words) or no one catching it before hitting the send button!!,What an insult to hockey fans!,I initially read the book when it was published (and still have it). My son asked for a good book to listen to on tape. Because he started playing hockey a few years ago, I suggested he do a search to see if this book had an audio edition. He really enjoyed it and I decided that I would listen to it also.,I was a sophomore in high school and was the only female who dared to play ice hockey with my brothers and their friends on ‚Äúthe pit‚Äù. This book brought back fond memories of those times. We watched In February 1980 on a Friday night with as many friends of ours that could fit into our living room the ‚ÄúMiracle on Ice.‚Äù,Coffey does a wonderful job of weaving the stories of all the players and coaches lives both before and after the ‚Äúmiracle.‚Äù He glides in and out of the details of each person‚Äôs life as though he were a skater on the ice handling the puck and directing the story where he wants it to go.,It is heart warming and at times heart wrenching to learn of those details. In 1980 we took pride in the boys of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team. After reading this book, I gained an even deeper appreciation for all that they endured both on and off the ice before, during, and after 1980.,What made the experience of listening to The Boys of Winter the most enjoyable?,This event combined with a phenomenal sophomore NHL season by a guy named Wayne Gretzky helped turn me into a huge hockey fan.  I thought I knew this whole story by heart.  i was wrong.  There was so much I didn't know.  I knew the players by number, position, and school, but I never knew the men behind the uniforms.  This book gives great insight into them by using a very clever framing device.  it will appeal to both the casual fan who may not have been around to experience the ""miracle"" and to the sports know-it-all.,What did you like best about this story?,The storytelling was really well done.  It sounds corny, but I actually got chills as the final seconds of the game ticked off.,Have you listened to any of Kirby Heyborne‚Äôs other performances before? How does this one compare?,Heyborne did a pretty good job, but after only a few minutes of listening it became very evident to me that he knows very little about hockey.  He paces well and gives the text a lot of flair, but each time he said ""blue line"" as two separate words I would lose my mind.  Hulk would have smashed his iPod.,Did you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?,It makes me smile.  It's just a wonderful story about a bunch of college kids who were able to defeat the greatest team in the world.,Any additional comments?,Good story for a hockey family to listen to on a long trip.,This book added more depth to the stories of the players and coaches of the team. I really enjoyed learning more about them and their lives after hockey in the Olympics. It was frustrating how the play-by-play telling of the Russia game was stop and start as they took detours to tell about each participant, But it was worth it in order to learn about them all. Recommend watching the movie miracle before you read this book so you know the basic story,I really enjoyed this story and the results that we all know, but it was very interesting to hear the back story on all the players and coaches. Overall very good, the only issue I have is that the narrator, who does a fantastic job at pronouncing the Russian players had trouble pronouncing various hockey terms, for instance, when talking about the blueline or redline, it was pronounced blue.....line and red...line. Hockey people will know what I'm talking about, but enjoyed the book no-less, except for this. Thanks,This is a great story. With really good behind the story Info. I would be more than willing to read/listen to more from this author and voice actor! However I think this particular book doesn't translate as the best to audiobook! I would and will refer this book to family and friends who want to go deeper into the legendary 1980 U. S. Olympic hockey team!,This book went into great detail about the game between the USA and USSr in The Mracle on Ice from the 1980 Winter Olympics.  I found it to be a very enjoyable walk down memory lane."
Cinder,"Contemporary,Romantic Suspense",Romance,"Why does the male narrator sound drunk throughout the story?! I felt drunk just listening to it.,I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd finish the audio with the narration, but the story was good and I tried to block out that all my favorite characters from this series suddenly sounded like a bunch of gross drunks all the time. Kind of ruins the enjoyment of the story.,I will say though that the storyline was really good. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite of all the stories, but I did enjoy it!,I‚Äôm only a half hour into the story and not sure whether I can finish. Both narrators are lacking. Story seems to be not as good as the others too. I‚Äôve listened to every story in this series. The last few books have been getting harder to finish. Combine that with the narration and I think I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll give it another 15 minutes to see if things pick up."

It is probably the best book ever written on human relations.  Anyone and everyone should find it to be a valuable guide, whether in personal, family, or business relationships.  Despite the title, which some may consider overly aggressive by todays'standards, the practices discussed in the book are in no way manipulative.  To the contrary, this book helps you learn the art and skill of conversation and persuasion through attentiveness to, and consideration of others.,,This is not a story that you listen to once and get rid of it. It is a reference manual that you will be able to use and refer to for years to come.  I own it in hardback, as well as on cassette (remember those?) so I was excited to see a digital version made available from Audible.  I bought it immediately and now look forward to being able to enjoy it again and again on my MP3 player.,The title doesn't do it justice. I was half expecting some slimeball manual of how to fake being a sympathetic person. On the contrary, this is a classic. Its message is that if you want to do well with people, you'd better become interested and considerate and pleasant to be around. The book tells you how, over and over, with principles and examples and anecdotes.,,The book was written in 1936 and listening to the audio version is rather like watching an old black and white movie. It's a little corny nowadays, but in an extremely charming way. I found myself enjoying the politeness of a byegone age and looking forward to the next installment.,,After listening once and becoming inspired, I requested a job upgrade, and my boss was smiling as he agreed. Wow! I was so shocked that I think I instantly forgot everything I learned. You bet I'll be coming back to study this one.,,I read a lot of self help books and find most of them silly, formulaic, and/or unrealistic.  This is perhaps the best self help book I have read, and was one of the first of the modern era.  The tone is very straightforward and practical with enough detail to be useful but not at all boring.  The suggestions seem trivial, yet, as the author points out repeatedly, they are actually unnatural to the vast majority and seldom practiced successful without attention and effort.,This books is dated (referring to contemporary characters that are no longer contemporary and may not be recognized by younger readers) but this does not distract very much from the core message of the book.  See Ralph's review for an excellent outline of the suggestions in this book.,This book had leaped to the top of my favorite self help books, which also include Critical Conversations and Stumbling on Happiness.  Most other self help books are either intrinsically worthless or subsumed by  one of the above.,The narration was just about perfect with a very clear delivery and excellent positive tone without any sappiness.,I highly recommend this book to anyone, particularly young adult readers.,Fundamental Techniques in Handling People,1.

Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.,I was given a copy of this book when I was 17 years old, by my friend ""Mad Harry"". In it he wrote ""Call me when you are Famous"". Well I am not famous, but did get to be a director of a large company in my mid 30's, and I have to say, without this book, I doubt if I would have made it. I am known for getting things done with minimum conflict. Listen to this, it is very polite and old fashioned now, but the principles of how to deal with people are every bit as valid as when this wonderful book was written.,,So.............,,Call me when you are famous!,,S,Sometimes the classics just can't be beat.  I took the Dale Carnegie course, and this book was required reading.  It completely changed the way I deal with people, and the overall effect is astonishing.  After reading the book, you'll be astonished as to how common-sensical the teachings are, but boy do they work.,I've had at least ten occasions over the past year where I had to deal with very difficult people who were bent on starting a fight or argument.  When we were finished, in each case the other person heartily apologized for their behavior and thanked me for keeping a cool head about things.  Most importantly though, is that I approached each of these encounters with the utmost confidence that I could handle this person, and this situation.  I didn't feel even the slightest bit nervous or afraid.  To encounter these types of situations feeling calm and confident is a rare gift that I now have.  There is no way to put a price tag on that.,I plan to listen to, and read this book many times over my life.  The lessons are invaluable.  Don't wait another day before learning the secrets contained in this book.,I went into this book with high expectations, as several people have said how much it helped them socially. I can't yet say whether it lived up to its reviews.,,I think the book had a lot of good ideas. I expect I will try to use some of them, and actually already have. I especially liked the section on arguing (or not), and think national debates (not to mention local) might go a lot better if people applied the principles from this book.,,It did seem to have its faults though. For one thing, it seemed kind of dated... I realize it was written in the 1930s, but it seems like human nature shouldn't have changed much since then, yet it feels like it has. For example, it's hard to imagine an owner of a large company giving you lots of his time and choosing your product over your competitors' just because you commented on something of interest to him (something that happens in about 25% of the book's examples). I recognize that this might be my limited experience though.,,Also, it's pretty clear that this book is intended to help people with their business relations, rather than close personal relationships and such, though there are some points that apply to the latter. But in most of the examples, someone gets another to like them and secures a business deal or something out of it.,,Though Mr. Carnegie stresses that sincerity is essential for his principles to work, it's hard, with all the examples ending in someone making out well business-wise, to keep that in mind, rather than thinking, ""Okay, I just have to say what people want to hear; flatter them, pretend I'm interested in their interests, and they'll be eager to help me and do what I ask!"" That's just a matter of how it's written though, I guess.,,I will end by saying, again, that there are good points to be distilled out of the book, but it's not a complete and perfect guide to social interaction.,If you don't need this book, then chances are you don't talk to people. You do talk to people right? This book is well worth your time, if you don't learn anything from it then you probably have people skills to rival those of Charles Schwab or Abe Lincon.,,I had heard about this book for years in various circles, in fact, I was even amused when it was referenced in the game ""Baldurs Gate"". I knew about it, yet I never took the time to read it. Well, I have now listened to it twice, and it will certanly get a third listening. I can't believe that I got this far in life and was unaware of some of the simple people skills presented in this work. Fortunately, I have done some of them naturally, and some have developed over time as I have grown up - still, had I had this book 20 years ago my life would have been a whole lot easier.,,This book is not filled with ""tricks"" to get people to like you, rather, it is how to develop your own character so that people like you naturally, and you like them naturally as well. No ""tricks"" involved, but it certanly gives you better insight into the nature of people, and I can testify that it works incredibly well.,I've listened to over 30 audio books.  This is the best most practical book I've ever listened to.  It works and it is not manipulation--pure gold.,I know it's a classic, but it is also very repetitive, drilling the same point home in 30 different ways. By the time you get halfway you kinda know what's expected of you:,It would be cool if they came out with a 2019 version featuring narration by somebody energetic like Gary Vaynerchuck and modern examples of the last 20-30 years.,This book is amazing.  It gives you examples of how people have managed different situations successfully and unsuccessfully.  It explains the ways to influence people without being false but just being nice.  I wish I had listed to this book 20 years ago.  I have been captivated.  I find myself unconsciously changing my behaviour, what a difference it has made when working with my staff or playing with my children.,,,This is one of those books that you will hear people talking about and this is also one of those books that it took me 30 years to get round to reading.  I wish that I had done so earlier.  This book has greatly improved my outlook on life and I can handle situations in a far slicker and more helpful way than before.  excellent book, I would recommend it to everyone.,I understand why people would rate this so highly - the concepts and principles could definitely help you influence people in and around the workplace... but I do feel like some of the 'stories' are outdated now.,,There are, what feels like, hundreds of stories to exemplify the principles, though they often sounded made up for the convenience of proving a point.,,I tried reading the book a few years ago but gave up half way through. The audiobook is easier to listen to, but it still (almost) became a chore to listen to - especially towards the end when some principles and examples were repeated.,,To summarise, I'd love for an updated version to be released - maybe using more modern and relevant examples, with a more enthused reader, and fewer 'stories' would be ideal.,I read this originally well over 30 years ago, and it is one of the books that has profoundly influenced my life.  The essence is simply the golden rule: Do as to others as you would be done by.  In a world where every one is (whether we like to admit it or not) out for themselves, it is still optimal to be loving and co-operative if you understand that life is essentially win-win: we gain ourselves by giving to others what they most want.  And if they only give us back 80% of what they get, we are still both better off, because a lot of what we want (recognition, respect, affection) is FREE.  So once this 'enlightened self-interest' gets a hold, out of the crooked stuff that man is made of, we find...we can all be happy!  Read it, DC explains it better than I do.,...but after reading this book I realise that most of my failings in business and personal life are easily-explained.  Within a week I have already seen positive changes in my relationships with people.  It can't be this easy can it?,this book is timeless. it offers great insights and examples of human behaviour. the only criticsm would be that it mainly deals with office and business. otherwise a great suggestion from a friend,The language is somewhat dated and some of the examples are quite amusing! It's rather difficult to see how such a book could work in such a cynical world!!,,However, it does!,,It's a great book - I'm on my second listen...,,You can take one or  more of the 15ish principles to change how you work/play with people.,,I've already started to use some of the principles and I've seen rewards, especially in recognising good the work I see staff doing.,,It's NOT rocket science. It's all basic pysychology, but it's well written(and well spoken!).,,Give it a try!!,,Everyone should read this book - parents and children, managers and employees. Excellent and enjoyable.,This is no joke. I started this book being very cynical thinking you can have anecdotal tales that prove anything, and really this is such a ""dated"" book that it was probably a mistake buying it ...but something struck a chord as it is really well narrated and so I decided to put it to practice.,,...at the risk of sounding like an anecdote from from the book .... I had recently been missold something at a large retail store and had been back 3 times, and got no joy. So, I wrote a letter looking at it from their point of view rather than mine. My usual letters would have been stern and objectionable and damning of their customer services, and usually I'd get back a response just as challenging, and this goes on for a while until I give up, or win the argument. Anyway, usuing the approach in this book which is so easy to follow, two days later, a phone call, with an apology, and a refund for ¬£109...sorted. I tell you - I'm bought on this. Its also helped me settle a dispute with an awkward colleague who loves to argue. I settled the debate in one email - to my satisfaction - as opposed to 6 or 7 which it would usually take.,,It's read in a very listen-able format and I echo the sentiments of the majority of reviews on here - listen to this - it will change your outlook on human behaviour, and take it from me...it works.,I honestly do wish I had read this years ago! Every parent, teacher, manager, supervisor- in fact every human being should read this book. I wonder how many relationships would have been saved if I had read this book as a young adult.,There is a lot of great advice in this book but some of the tactics are manipulative and I feel that most people would see right through them. The main saving grace is that you must be genuine in caring about others, otherwise this book will be a waste of time.,I am at 60, I wish I knew about this masterpiece at a younger age. However, I think never too late I learned from the book tremendous human relations techniques. The book illustrates many real life stories from world leaders and even regular people. I am planning to read it again and again to rally grasp the wonderful examples. Therefore, I advise everyone to read it. It's really easy reading, it only took me three to complete. Thank you Dale Carnegie,- Enjoyed the examples with each tip he gave.,- Saw a difference in my attitude at work. Became more confident which was acknowledge by my Senior Managers.,- Many examples were outdated.,- Due to the time this book was written, examples are only of men in the work force. Even used a conflict example where the man had to ""calm down"" his ""crazy wife"".,A must for anyone looking to improve communication techniques and grow as a leader. Yes!!,the book itself is great. 1st time i got this in audio and glad i did.. the speaker /voice is just perfect for this book.,unless you intend to go back in time to where men were men and goats were nervous. i would give this book a miss.,outdated and a poor choice of credit spend,Practical advice that is simple and can still be applied in modern times. Great listen for anyone looking to improve how they interact with others.,a lot of this should be common sense! but the examples and reinforcement of tact and manners help you to understan why its important and how to apply the lessons,has made a massive difference to the way I approach social situations and everyfay life,,Very easy to follow with base line principles. Fairly old school but still thought was very good and enjoyed listening to."

It Ends with Us,Women's Fiction,Literature & Fiction,"I need to put in a disclaimer first.  This story deals with abuse, both sexual and physical, there are disturbing scenes that might not be appropriate for everyone.,,With that being said, I just found this story ""ok"".  I didn't exactly like the narrator, in fact, I was waiting to hear her say, ""you know, OMG, Like he really likes me."" (in your best Valley Girl voice).  She sounded so juvenile most of the time it was difficult to listen to.,,As for the rest of the story, if you take away the abuse, it's an alright story.  Of course, the young girl starts a successful business and meets a gorgeous doctor who is wealthy, they get married and you would think live happily ever after.  Not exactly.  He has major anger issues and is both physically and sexually abusive.  Nice guy.,,If you enjoy reading about someone getting beat up and abused, this one might be the story for you.  For me, not so much.,What an amazing book! I got 2 hours of sleep last night because I couldn't stop listening! This is a very powerful book about strength, courage and prevailing! I am one of those people who see someone going through something and think why don't you just walk away or why let things happen to you...this book made me understand that it's not always so black and white. I always admit that I have no empathy for people (it's just not part of who I am I guess), I think with my brain not my heart most of the time and for the 1st time I honestly feel like I see that it's not always so easy to see things as right or wrong, good and bad or cut and dry, for the first time I actually see the grey area and completely understand it. Seeing what I've been ignorant too all my life is breaking my heart now. I wish I could go back to all the times I listened to people and treated their problems like they were easy to fix and tell them I'm sorry and that I wish I would have been a better listener, a better friend and more helpful to them when they needed me most.,Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and always seems to write a story that makes you fall in love with the characters no matter what faults or issues they have and she did it again with this book. I think I'll be thinking about this one for a very long time!,The characters in this book were all so likable and have so much depth and so many layers. That is part of what I loved so much about this book, even when I wanted to hate a character I just couldn't!,The narration is good but it took me a little while to get used to her male voices. After an hours at most I didn't even remember what I didn't like about the narration in the beginning.,Would you try another book from Colleen Hoover and/or Olivia Song?,Collen Hoover- NO   Olivia Song- Maybe,Did It Ends with Us inspire you to do anything?,No,Any additional comments?,I had a longer review, but the computer ate it, so there's that.,First off I'm glad that the author tried to tackle such a cruel, disturbing and often shameful subject matter. BUT she fell short on so many levels due to the way she crafted the story, it was irritatingly hard to get through.The contrivances, coincidences and the blatant in your face predictabilaty of this books painfully bad writing was grating. Most of that made the characters lack the emotional depths needed for an emotional read like this. It just doesn't work, it's sloppy and a disservice to readers, and the message trying to be convayed.,I was really eager to read this book, it was on TBR list for awhile, audible & amazon is full of 5 star reviews for it. I'm truly baffled by all the 5 star reviews, but different opinions and all that. I read about all the FEELS, OMG the FEELS.... the emotion... I didn't feel anything but annoyed and pissed that I wasted my time on such a poorly written, hyped book. Don't believe the reviews, this is NOT 5 star writing! This is book is no better than what you'd see on a Lifetime movie.,NOW- I'm even more pissed at the ammount of reviews suggesting the MC made the wrong decision at the end, and blamed her for some of her actions during the book! Seriously? And people feeling more for the jerk (I'm trying not to spoil) than the victim is messed up.,Three stars for the first half of the book (though I was tempted to 2/12 star it). Learning more about the MC through her ""Ellen"" journals was a clever way to tell what she experienced.,I was moved by the epilog and CH revelations about her own families experience with abuse. I did get the FEELS from that,Incredibly juvenile and boring.  I could not get far in this book.  It is romance for tweens.  I'll be returning this.,Where to begin?  Colleen Hoover spun her words and drew me into her web.  I devoured this book in a day. She makes you fall in love with her characters.  Lily is a strong heroine that you root for.  Both male leads implant themselves into your heart. I can't say much more without spoilers but I can say that this is a must read.  Olivia Song does this story justice with her narration.  I anxiously await the next Colleen Hoover book.,I didn't know exactly what I was getting into when I started this audio. But holy moly the authors notes was so similar to what happened to me! W/O giving spoilers let me tell you this is by far one of Colleen's best books/audio. Narrator was freaking awesome! I say ""yes"" to spending your credit and ""hell yes"" to what ever price is suggested to purchase this audio!!DO NOT MISS THIS AUDIO!!!,,I am conflicted, this book I truly have no words. Or a word that comes to mind a lot is WOW. It was so different yet so raw, Colleen sucks you in and doesn‚Äôt let you let go until the very last moment.,I both loved and hated this book because of its truths. I can‚Äôt imagine the struggles one has to deal with to not only be in a relationship like this but to be able to get out.,I am not going to go in a lot of detail about the book you can read the blurbs or other reviews. But I will say this Lily is a character I will not soon forget.,I cried, I laughed and I want a best friend like Alyssa. She had the best quote of the book for me. (Quote will be hidden on Goodreads and not published on Audible or Amazon.),""As his sister I wish more than anything that you can find a way to forgive him. As your best friend if you take him back I will never speak to you again.‚Äù - Alyssa,I don‚Äôt usually read reviews or blurbs, all I knew is this was a Colleen Hoover book and she created 2 of my favorite books Maybe Someday and Ugly Love. So it was a given I was going to get and read this book.,I choose audiobook because I like audio and her books to this point have all been wonderful on audio. This book is no different Olivia delivers and makes you feel what Lily feels.,*All my Reviews are 100% honest and my own.*,This is a powerful book. I think it is important for all women to read this book. It dug up many different emotions from me. I was confused just as Lilly was. I was hurt as Lilly was. I was just as angry as Lilly was. What a powerful message this story provides. I'm still shedding tears about it. I beg you to read it and share it.  It's life changing.,This one came recommended to me and while I was skeptical because the last Hoover novel I read years ago I found to be very juvenile, I figured I would give it a shot. Nothing has changed. While I am an avid fiction reader/listener, I need my fiction to have substance and depth. I want to feel immersed in the story and I need it to be believable. This book read like a PG version of 50 Shades of Gray directed at early 20-somethings. I found it hard to get behind main character Lily, her perfectly handsome neurosurgeon love interest who, *spoiler alert*, miraculously changes his entire dating philosophy in about 3 seconds because she is too irresistible, and her good-guy-from-the-wrong-upbringing teenage ex-boyfriend, who also happens to be perfectly handsome and also obsessed with her. Oh, and all the while she decides, after having one job, to open her own flower shop that is instantly a booming successful business, thanks to help of a random, walk-in wealthy new BFF who offers to work for free! I'm sorry, but NO. I told myself I would finish this one, but when I started my car this weekend and I saw there were still 6 whole hours left on this one, I called it quits.,Colleen Hoover has done it again! This is a must read that will capture your heart from the very beginning!,- very cheesy.,- the same usual love story.,-fifty shade copy.,-I didn‚Äôt finish it.,-wasted my credit.,Colleen Hoover does it again, another winner.  Heartbreakingly beautiful, the story follows Lily Bloom, who as a young girl has to deal with a dominating father, who abuses her mother.  Her best friend, Atlas Corrigan, whom she helps when he's in a very low place in his life, and too good to be true neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, who has his own demons from the past. Just as Atlas follows his dream, so too does Lily and this leads her into the path of her future best friend Alyssa (Ryle's sister), who I have to say, is one of the nicest people ever.  The story follows Lily as she struggles with her own past demons as she sees her life and her decisions spiralling out of control.  Enter back into her life Atlas, who immediately starts questioning her life choices.  The story makes so many statements about domestic violence and at the same time it is not judgemental.  It left me very emotional, yet I still had the ability to feel for all the characters and their situations.  A true masterpiece. The author also explains at the end of the book how the story came about, which furthermore adds to the emotions currently playing around in my head.  A story that will stay with me forever.  Highly recommend.,,so some bits in the book were a bit cringey but overall such an easy read. defo a good booktok read and the ending had me in so many feels,,I had mixed feelings about this book at the beginning. At times it was quite dull and the characters seemed pretty one dimensional. Then about half way through the momentum shifted.  Lily's character gradually evolved, sparked by inner conflict, compassion, wisdom and empathy. Themes of abuse were not only handled sensitively but written from a deep sense of emotional complexity. By the end of the book I was fully invested in Lily's story and the heartbreaking dilemma with which she was faced. I'm so glad I stuck with the book and  I loved the ending.,This story moved me in so many ways and has left me completely heartbroken. I fell head over in love with Ryle, I felt his pain, his torment between what he knew was wrong but couldn't put it right. He was such a broken character. Lily was strong and whilst her decisions broke my heart they were completely the right one.,,This is such a powerful story and could easily be anyone of us right now. The narrative was good, read with plenty of emotion and a calmness where needed.,,,I completely lost myself in this story brought to life a excellent narration.,This book seems to be everywhere so I thought it‚Äôd be great, but I absolutely could not finish it. The main character is unbelievably annoying and unlikeable and the romanticisation of violent men is so troubling.,While this book may be a reflection on many  women who suffer domestic violence by narcissistic men, Lily has the luxury of money and support unlike many others.,Men with these characteristics pleasure in control  and manipulation leaving the victim powerless to manage even the simplest of tasks.,This book barely scratches the surface.,This is truly awful. All the characters are terrible and the plot is completely cliche. I‚Äôm told it gets better but sex scenes are not my thing and there seem to be a lots. The writing is dreadful. I know lots of people love this writing style but it‚Äôs truly awful to me.,I was extremely disappointed with this book and angered by the romanticising of domestic abuse. The writing is basic and cringeworthy.,Avoid,The foundation of the story is based on a lived experience of domestic violence. However overall the book left me disappointed. The dialogues are primitive, the inner monologues are even worse. The plot is very predictable - the big reveals were in plain sight all along, - and the characters are underdeveloped, if not shallow (‚Äúhow could he do that horrific thing, he donates to charity‚Äù). The book is tone deaf in current climate and lacks any self awareness around white privilege.,It could make an average but watchable enough Netflix movie, but not worth investing 11+ hours in the book,I genuinely never write reviews but if i can save someone I will be glad.,,I had seen so many 5 star reviews I felt like I'd come across a real gem and I have never been so disappointed.,,The story could have been done brilliantly, but instead it completely lacked imagination and it was just so predictable. As a result it failed to properly unpack the super complex and important themes it set out to discuss. Also the super cheesy American language and names did my head in (LILY BLOOM?). I found myself finishing it just hoping it would redeem itself but it did not. Save your credit.,,,,Tried so many times with this one, tried to enjoy, tried to get into the story, tried to get past the narrators irritating voice and for the first time ever, with an audio book, I gave in. I Decided that those next 8 hours of my life would be better served doing something less boring, like watching paint dry.,After seeing this book recommended fiercely by every person on ‚ÄúBookTok‚Äù, I decided to take a chance on it, even though the synopsis sounded cliche. I wish I had trusted my intuition. This book had me rolling my eyes every few lines at the predictability of it all! This reminds me of the One Direction fanfics I used to read as a 14 year old. The characters are so one dimensional. I can‚Äôt for the life of me work out why this is so popular?,Couldn't get past the first two chapters. Author wasn't fooling me. Can see what is coming a mile off and much like real life, I'm not standing for it!,Unintelligent, basic, predictable. Made me cringe. So disappointing given the 4 stars. If you enjoy an intriguing, well written story, do not buy this novel.,When it comes to the motive and message Colleen delivers, I do understand and sense that she is writing from life experience and is writing with the heart even though it‚Äôs based on her parents she also was a victim of child trauma she does a great effort delivering on that. I think majority of big fans with book would be people who have survived in abusive relationships. It wasn‚Äôt until the final pages when lily and her mother talking, she mentions a valid point in some way to people who are on the other side of the window when it comes to this topic. The part when she says ‚Äúknow your limits‚Äù the more you stay the harder it gets to leave. I believe a person who has been through abuse and has experienced it can say this and believe it. In some ways it does make sense as no one can sit outside and look through a window and just say ‚Äújust leave‚Äùthinking it‚Äôs that easy without being in the victims shoes.,As Lilly says in the book it‚Äôs easy to say if you haven‚Äôt experienced it firsthand. But when she does, she mentions ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt so easy to hate the person who mistreats you when most of the time they‚Äôre your godsend‚Äù now everyone is different but believe if you are a emotional person It would be hard, saying this I am not saying that Ryle is in the right but I do now understand I can‚Äôt just sit here and say ‚Äújust leave‚Äù,However, as much as I give credit to the author with writing from the heart and the message she gets out there for the readers, in my personal opinion I think the plot line could of been a lot and I mean a lot more better than this, In some bits of the story it left me scratching my head and I would trance out of the message she‚Äôs trying to deliver and when I have to do this it becomes an uneasy read for me.,Through out the book I sense that she has written this on a personal level and maybe is the reason the plot line was so basic. Clearly her priority was the topic of abuse and the characters around it. When I‚Äôm thinking about the storyline it has me thinking not my cup of tea but maybe interesting and enjoyable to read for her young adult readers.,In the end she decides to leave Ryle, even though they both still love each other I think it was the right choice. She thinks of her daughter and can not take the risk of her daughter growing up the way she did. ‚ÄúIt ends with us‚Äù,In conclusion I give big ups to the message but was poorly backed up with a mediocre plot and story line.,,I loved this book! It's exceptionally honest, thought provoking and an emotional roller coaster. One of the most moving books I've read it a very long time.,This book absolutely destroyed me. I am a wreck! Hoovers books have always made me laugh, cry and cheer for the characters. But never have I ever felt total and utter despair, rage, longing, confusion nor personally hurt. Please read this book.,Really enjoyed this story and the narrator was wonderful. I've struggled to finish some audio books because I found it hard to listen to the narrator. The storyline was very thought provoking and all to real, even in today's society. This is my first Colleen Hoover experience lol and it will not be my last xx‚ô°xx,I really struggled to get into this story - it‚Äôs as though the author is trying to branch out from corny chick lit and write something hard hitting but has missed the mark.,The narrators voice is quite irritating and hard to listen to, and even harder to take seriously once the story starts to touch on domestic violence.,The storyline is confusing in that some elements are so unrealistic and daydreamy (23 year old woman falls in love with gorgeous neurosurgeon and opens very successful business just like that), but then the DV comes into it and is depicted in a very realistic way that obviously comes from a place of experience. The two storylines just don‚Äôt gel and the end result is a very serious message being lost amongst a whole lot of fluff. Imagine an episode of Gossip Girl but the writers have tried to add some depth and grit.,The underlying message toward the end and in the prologue that fathers who are violently abusive to the mothers of their children still deserve to have a meaningful relationship with their child borders on insulting to women who have fled domestic violence.,Perhaps an innocent young person who has never had to endure abuse might find this book gripping but I found it predictable and lame."
